At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty switches in an office computer network are to be connected so that each switch has a direct connection to exactly three other switches. How many connections will be necessary?",
