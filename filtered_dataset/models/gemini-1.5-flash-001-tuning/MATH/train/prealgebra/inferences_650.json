At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $2^x$ be the greatest power of $2$ that is a factor of $144$, and let $3^y$ be the greatest power of $3$ that is a factor of $144$. Evaluate the following expression: $$\\left(\\frac15\\right)^{y - x}$$",

Similarly, $3^3 = 27$ is not a factor of $144$ since dividing $144$ by $27$ gives a remainder of $9$.\n\nIt follows that $2^4$ is the greatest power of $2$ that is a factor of $144$, and that $3^2$ is the greatest power of $3$ that is a factor of $144$.
