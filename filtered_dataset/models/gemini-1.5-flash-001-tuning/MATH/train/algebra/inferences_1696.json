        "ground_truth": "The numerator is equal to $x^{1+2+3+\\cdots + 15}$. The exponent is the sum of the first 15 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $\\frac{15\\cdot16}{2}=120$. So the numerator is $x^{120}$.\n\nThe denominator is equal to $x^{2+4+6+\\cdots + 20}=x^{2(1+2+3+\\cdots + 10)}$. The exponent is twice the sum of the first 10 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $2\\cdot \\frac{10\\cdot11}{2}=110$. So the denominator is $x^{110}$.\n\nThe entire fraction becomes $\\frac{x^{120}}{x^{110}}=x^{120-110}=x^{10}$. Plugging in $x=2$ yields $2^{10}=\\boxed{1024}$."
