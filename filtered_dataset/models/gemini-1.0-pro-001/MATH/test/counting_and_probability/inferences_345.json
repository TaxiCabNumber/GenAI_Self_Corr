At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach day, two out of the three teams in a class are randomly selected to participate in a MATHCOUNTS trial competition. What is the probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Each day, two teams are selected out of the three teams. So, the probability that Team A is selected on any given day is 2/3.\n\nThe probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days is equal to the probability that Team A is selected on two days plus the probability that Team A is selected on three days.\n\nThe probability that Team A is selected on two days is equal to the sum of the probability that Team A is selected on the first two days, the first and third days, and the second and third days. The probability that Team A is selected on the first two days is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9. The probability that Team A is selected on the first and third days is also 4/9. The probability that Team A is selected on the second and third days is 4/9. Therefore, the probability that Team A is selected on two days is 4/9 + 4/9 + 4/9 = 12/9 = 4/3.\n\nThe probability that Team A is selected on three days is equal to (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) = 8/27.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Team A is selected on at least two of the next three days is 4/3 + 8/27 = 40/27.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{40/27}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can compute this a few ways, but the numbers seem small enough that we can go ahead and just compute the probability of A being selected all three days, and the probability of A being selected exactly 2 of the three days. Team A is selected on any given day with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$, because there are ${3 \\choose 2} = 3$ possible pairs of teams, and 2 of them contain A. So, there is a $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27}$ chance of being selected all three days. Of being selected exactly twice, there is a $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot {3 \\choose 2} = \\frac{4}{9}$ chance. Adding these two yields $\\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{8+12}{27} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{27}}$."
