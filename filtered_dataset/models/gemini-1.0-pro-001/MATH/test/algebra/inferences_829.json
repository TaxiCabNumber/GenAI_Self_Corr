        "inference": "Since $3^4 = 81$, we have $x + y = 4$. Similarly, since $3^1 = 3$, we have $x - y = 1$. Solving these two equations, we get $x = \\frac{5}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $xy = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{15}{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $81 = 3^4$, then $3 = 81^{1/4}$. Comparing exponents, it follows that we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 4 \\\\\nx -y &= 1/4.\n\\end{align*} Summing the two equations yields that $2x = 4+1/4 = 17/4$, so $x = 17/8$. Subtracting the two equations yields that $2y = 4-1/4 = 15/4$, so $y = 15/8$. Thus, $xy = \\frac{17}{8} \\cdot \\frac{15}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{64}}$."
