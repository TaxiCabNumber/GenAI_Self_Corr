At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**\nFind the pints of water Jasmine drank per mile by dividing the 1.5 pints she drank in the first 3 miles by 3:\n1.5 pints / 3 miles = 0.5 pints / mile\n\n**Step 2**\nMultiply the pints of water per mile by the number of next 10 miles to find the total pints of water Jasmine would drink:\n0.5 pints / mile x 10 miles = 5 pints\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can set up the ratios $\\frac{1.5}{3}=\\frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is how many pints of water she'd drink in the next 10 miles. We cross-multiply to get $3x=1.5(10)=15$, which means $x=5$. Jasmine would drink $\\boxed{5}$ pints of water in the next 10 miles."
