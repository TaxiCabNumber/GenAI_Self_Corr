        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA movie theater seats $100$ patrons. The theater is full for the 5:00 pm Saturday movie. Adult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each and children's tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each. If the theater collected $\\$640$ in ticket sales for the 5:00 pm Saturday show, how many children's tickets were sold?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $y$ be the number of children's tickets sold. We know that:\n\n$$x + y = 100$$ and $$9x + 5y = 640$$\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 100 - y$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$9(100 - y) + 5y = 640$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$900 - 9y + 5y = 640$$\n\n$$-4y = -260$$\n\n$$y = 65$$\n\nTherefore, the number of children's tickets sold is $65$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{65}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.\n\nAdult tickets sell for $\\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.\n\nWe now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.\n\nWe multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \\rightarrow 4y=260 \\rightarrow y=65$.\n\nTherefore, $\\boxed{65 \\text{ children tickets }}$ were sold."
