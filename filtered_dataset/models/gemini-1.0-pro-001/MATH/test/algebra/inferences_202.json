        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many values of $x$ is the expression $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}$  not defined?",
        "inference": "The expression is not defined when $x^2-9=0$.  This is because division by zero is undefined.\n$$x^2-9=0$$\n$$x^2=9$$\n$$x=\\pm \\sqrt{9}=\\pm 3$$\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, we need to find the number of values of $x$ such that $x^2-9=0$. Rearranging the equation and taking the square root of both sides, we have $x^2-9=0\\Rightarrow x^2=9 \\Rightarrow x=\\pm3$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ different values of $x$ that make the given expression undefined."
