At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPaula invests $\\$10,\\!000$ for 5 years at an interest rate of $10\\%$ per year. If the interest is simple interest, how much is her investment worth at the end of those five years?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe formula for simple interest is $I=Prt$, where $I$ is the interest, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate (as a decimal), and $t$ is the time (in years).\n\nIn this case, we have $P=\\$10,\\!000$, $r=0.10$, and $t=5$. So, the interest is:\n\n$$I=Prt=(10,\\!000)(0.10)(5)=\\$5,\\!000$$\n\nTherefore, the value of Paula's investment at the end of five years is:\n\n$$P+I=10,\\!000+5,\\!000=\\boxed{\\$15,\\!000}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$15,\\!000$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the interest is simple interest, then she earns $0.1(\\$10,\\!000) = \\$1,\\!000$ each year.  Therefore, at the end of 5 years, she has earned $5(\\$1,\\!000) = \\$5,\\!000$.  So, her investment is now worth $\\$10,\\!000 + \\$5,\\!000 = \\boxed{\\$15,\\!000}$."
