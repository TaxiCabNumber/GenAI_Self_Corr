At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the domain of the real-valued function $f(x)=\\frac{2x-7}{\\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}}$?",
        "inference": "The denominator of the function must be non-zero for the function to be defined. Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n$$\\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}\\ne0$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$x^2-5x+6\\ne0$$\n\nFactoring the left side, we get:\n\n$$(x-2)(x-3)\\ne0$$\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers except $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\(\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}|x\\ne2,3\\}\\).

        "ground_truth": "The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e. we must have $x^2-5x+6>0$.  Factoring, we get $(x-3)(x-2)>0$. So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive. They are both negative when $x<2$. They are both positive when $x>3$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<2 \\text{ or } x>3$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)}$ in interval notation."
