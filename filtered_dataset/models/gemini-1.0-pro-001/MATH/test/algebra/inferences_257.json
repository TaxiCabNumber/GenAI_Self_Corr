At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 7$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$. What is the area of the square?",
        "inference": "Let $(x_1, 7)$ and $(x_2, 7)$ be the endpoints of the side of the square that lies on the line $y=7$.  Since these points lie on the parabola $y=2x^2+8x+4$, we have $7 = 2x_1^2 + 8x_1 + 4$ and $7 = 2x_2^2 + 8x_2 + 4$. Subtracting these equations, we get $0 = 2(x_1^2 - x_2^2) + 8(x_1 - x_2)$, which simplifies to $x_1 - x_2 = 0$, so $x_1 = x_2$.\n\nTherefore, the side of the square that lies on the line $y=7$ has length $x_2 - x_1 = 0$. Since the square has four equal sides, all four sides have length 0.\n\nThe area of the square is therefore $0^2 = \\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The points of intersection of the line $y = 7$ and $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$, by substitution, are found when $2x^2 + 8x + 4 = 7 \\Longrightarrow 2x^2 + 8x - 3 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, $$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-3)}}{2 \\cdot 2}.$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the point of intersection, which will give a side length of the square. The difference is given by $\\frac{\\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-3)}}2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{88}}{2} = \\sqrt{22}$. Thus, the area of the square is $\\boxed{22}$."
