At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConvert $222_{10}$ to base $13$.  Use digits A, B, and C if necessary.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nFirst, divide $222$ by $13$. The quotient is $17$ and the remainder is $5$. So, the first digit in the base $13$ expansion of $222$ is $5$.\n\nNext, divide $17$ by $13$. The quotient is $1$ and the remainder is $4$. So, the second digit in the base $13$ expansion of $222$ is $4$.\n\nFinally, divide $1$ by $13$. The quotient is $0$ and the remainder is $1$. So, the third digit in the base $13$ expansion of $222$ is $1$.\n\nTherefore, $222_{10} = BA5_{13}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{BA5_{13}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $222$ is $13^2=169$. The largest multiple of $169$ less than $222$ is $1\\cdot 169$, and $222-1 \\cdot 169 = 53$. The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $53$ is $13$, and the largest multiple of $13$ less than $53$ is $4\\cdot 13$. $53-4 \\cdot 13= 1$. Thus, $222=1 \\cdot 13^2 + 4 \\cdot 13^1 + 1 \\cdot 13^0$. So $222$ in base $13$ is $\\boxed{141_{13}}$."
