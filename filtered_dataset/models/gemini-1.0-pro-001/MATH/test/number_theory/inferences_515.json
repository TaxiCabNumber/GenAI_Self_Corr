At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

For the alternating sum of the digits to be divisible by $11$, the following must hold:\n\n$$(1-x+4+y)\\equiv 0\\pmod{11}\\Rightarrow x-y\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}$$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are digits, $x-y$ can only take values $\\{0,1,\\cdots,9\\}.$  The only value that $x-y$ can take to make the congruence hold is $6$, so $x=6$ and $y=0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. The only possibilities for $a-b+c-d$ are $-11$, $0$, and $11$.\nPossibility 1: $1-b+c-4=-11 \\implies c-b=-8$. This gives us two possible values: $c=0, b=8$, and $c=1, b=9$.\nPossibility 2: $1-b+c-4=0 \\implies c-b=3$. This gives us $7$ possible values, where $c$ is any integer from $3$ to $9$, and $b=c-3$.\nPossibility 3: $1-b+c-4=11 \\implies c-b=14$. This is impossible since the digit $c$ cannot be greater than $14$,  Thus there are a total of $2+7=\\boxed{9}$ possible values."
