        "inference": "Let the roots be $p, q,$ and $r$. Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have \\[p+q+r=52\\] \\[pq+pr+qr=581\\] \\[pqr=k\\] Since $p, q,$ and $r$ are distinct prime numbers, we have $pqr=(p-1)(q-1)(r-1)=(p-1)(q-1)(q+1-p)=(p-1)(q-p)(q+1)$.  Therefore, we have \\[k=(p-1)(q-p)(q+1)\\] Since $p, q,$ and $r$ are distinct prime numbers, we have $p-1, q-p,$ and $q+1$ are all positive integers. Therefore, $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $p, q,$ and $r$ are distinct prime numbers, we have $p-1\\geq 2, q-p\\geq 2,$ and $q+1\\leq r-1$. Therefore, $k\\geq 2\\cdot 2\\cdot(r-1)=4(r-1)$.  Since $p, q,$ and $r$ are distinct prime numbers, we have $r\\geq 5$. Therefore, $k\\geq 4(5-1)=16$.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, we have $k\\geq 17$.  The only prime number between $16$ and $20$ is $19$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=19}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{k=19}$. I hope it is correct.",
