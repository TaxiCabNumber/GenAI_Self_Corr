        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe capacity of a school is 1100 students and the current enrollment is 980 students. If the student population increases at a rate of 5 percent per year, what is the smallest integer $n$ such that the enrollment will exceed the capacity in $n$ years?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $P_0$ be the initial population, $r$ be the annual growth rate, and $n$ be the number of years. We are given that $P_0=980$ and $r=5\\%=0.05$. We want to find the smallest integer $n$ such that \n\n$$P_0(1+r)^n>1100$$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get\n\n$$(1+r)^n>\\frac{1100}{P_0}$$\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get\n\n$$n\\log(1+r)>\\log\\left(\\frac{1100}{P_0}\\right)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\log(1+r)$, we get\n\n$$n>\\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{1100}{P_0}\\right)}{\\log(1+r)}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get\n\n$$n>\\frac{\\log\\left(\\frac{1100}{980}\\right)}{\\log(1+0.05)}$$\n\n$$n>\\frac{\\log1.1224}{\\log1.05}$$\n\n$$n>\\frac{0.0495}{0.04879}$$\n\n$$n>1.015$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ is $n=\\boxed{2}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$2$}.

        "ground_truth": "Five percent of 980 is $980/20=49$, so after one year the enrollment will be $980+49=1029$.  Five percent of 1029 is $49+5\\%(49)=51\\frac{9}{20}$, so at the end of the second year, there will be $1029+51\\frac{9}{10}=1080\\frac{9}{20}$ students (or, rather, 1080 students).  Five percent of $1080\\frac{9}{20}$ is greater than 50, so at the end of $\\boxed{3}$ years, there will be more than 1100 students."
