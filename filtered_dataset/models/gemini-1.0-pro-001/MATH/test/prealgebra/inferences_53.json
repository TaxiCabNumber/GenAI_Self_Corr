At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlina and Joe are both thinking of the same positive number. Alina tells Joe that her number is a factor of 9, while he tells her that it is a factor of 12. If the number is not 1, what is it?",
