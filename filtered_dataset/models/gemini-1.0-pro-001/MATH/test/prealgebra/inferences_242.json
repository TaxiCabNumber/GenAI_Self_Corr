        "inference": "Let the fraction be $\\frac{x}{y}$. We know that $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{8}$ and $x + y = 91$. Solving the first equation, we get $x = 5y$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $5y + y = 91$, which simplifies to $6y = 91$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 15$. Plugging this back into $x = 5y$, we get $x = 75$. Therefore, the difference between the denominator and numerator is $y - x = 15 - 75 = -60$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-60}.$ I hope it is correct.",
