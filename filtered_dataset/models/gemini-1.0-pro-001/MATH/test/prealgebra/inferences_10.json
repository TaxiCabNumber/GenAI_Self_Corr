        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJavier is biking at 15 miles per hour. There are 5280 feet in a mile. How many feet does he travel in one minute?",
        "inference": "1. Convert Javier's speed from miles per hour to feet per minute:\n15 miles per hour * (5280 feet per mile) / (60 minutes per hour) = 1320 feet per minute\n\n2. Calculate the distance Javier travels in one minute:\n1320 feet per minute * 1 minute = 1320 feet\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1320$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 15 miles per hour is 1/4 mile per minute, Javier travels $(5280)(1/4) = \\boxed{1320}$ feet in one minute."
