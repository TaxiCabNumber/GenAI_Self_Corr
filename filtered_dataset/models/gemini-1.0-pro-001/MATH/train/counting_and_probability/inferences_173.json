At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil rolls 6 fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that at least two dice show the same number?",
        "inference": "First, let's calculate the probability that all 6 dice show different numbers. There are 6 different numbers on each die, so there are 6 choices for the first die, 5 choices for the second die, 4 choices for the third die, 3 choices for the fourth die, 2 choices for the fifth die, and only 1 choice for the sixth die. Therefore, the probability that all 6 dice show different numbers is:\n\n$$P(\\text{all different}) = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6^6} = \\frac{720}{46656} \\approx 0.0154$$\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability that at least two dice show the same number. This is the complement of the probability that all 6 dice show different numbers. Therefore, the probability that at least two dice show the same number is:\n\n$$P(\\text{at least two same}) = 1 - P(\\text{all different}) = 1 - 0.0154 \\approx 0.9846$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.9846$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
