        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
        "inference": "The number of words on each page is congruent to 184, modulo 203. This means that the number of words on each page can be expressed in the form 184 + 203k for some integer k. Since each page has no more than 100 words on it, we have 184 + 203k \u2264 100. Solving for k, we get k \u2264 -41. The smallest non-negative value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = 0. Therefore, the number of words on each page is 184 + 203(0) = 184.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{184}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it."
