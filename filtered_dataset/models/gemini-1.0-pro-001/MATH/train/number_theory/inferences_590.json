        "inference": "Let $n$ be a positive integer multiple of $1001$. Then $n = 1001k$ for some integer $k$.  We can write $n = 10^{j} - 10^{i}$ as $1001k = 10^{j} - 10^{i}$  Dividing both sides by $10^{i}$, we get $1001k/10^{i} = 10^{j-i} - 1$.  Since $1001$ is prime, the only divisors of $1001$ are $1$ and $1001$.  Therefore, the only possible values of $k/10^{i}$ are $1$ and $1001$.  If $k/10^{i} = 1$, then $k = 10^{i}$ and $n = 10^{i} - 10^{i} = 0$.  This is not a positive integer multiple of $1001$, so we can discard this case.  If $k/10^{i} = 1001$, then $k = 1001 \\cdot 10^{i}$ and $n = 10^{j} - 10^{i} = 1001 \\cdot 10^{i} - 10^{i} = 1000 \\cdot 10^{i}$.  This is a positive integer multiple of $1001$, so we have found a solution.  We can continue this process to find all of the solutions.  For each value of $i$ from $0$ to $99$, we can solve for $j$ to get $j = i + 3$.  Therefore, there are $100$ solutions.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $1001 = 7\\times 11\\times 13$. We have $7\\times 11\\times 13\\times k = 10^j - 10^i = 10^i(10^{j - i} - 1)$.

From the factorization $10^6 - 1 = (10^3 + 1)(10^{3} - 1)$, we see that $j-i = 6$ works; also, $a-b | a^n - b^n$ implies that $10^{6} - 1 | 10^{6k} - 1$, and so any $\\boxed{j-i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}}$ will work.\nTo show that no other possibilities work, suppose $j-i \\equiv a \\pmod{6},\\ 1 \\le a \\le 5$, and let $j-i-a = 6k$.
