At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA teacher finds that when she offers candy to her class of 30 students, the mean number of pieces taken by each student is 5. If every student takes some candy, what is the greatest number of pieces one student could have taken?",
        "inference": "1. The total number of pieces of candy taken by the class is 30 * 5 = 150.\n\n2. Since every student takes at least 1 piece, the greatest number of pieces one student could have taken is 150 - (30 - 1) = 150 - 29 = 121.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{121}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are 30 students and a mean of 5 candies per student, there are a total of $5 \\cdot 30 = 150$ pieces of candy. Since every student must take at least one piece of candy, the first 29 students must take a total of at least 29 pieces. Since $150 - 29 = 121$, the greatest number of pieces one student can take is $\\boxed{121}$."
