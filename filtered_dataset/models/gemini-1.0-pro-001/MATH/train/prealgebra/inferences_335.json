        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAllen and Ben are painting a fence. The ratio of the amount of work Allen does to the amount of work Ben does is $3:5$. If the fence requires a total of $240$ square feet to be painted, how many square feet does Ben paint?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of square feet Allen paints and $y$ be the number of square feet Ben paints.\n\nSince the ratio of the amount of work Allen does to the amount of work Ben does is $3:5$,\n\n$$\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{3}{5}.$$Solving for $y$, we get\n\n$$y=\\frac{5x}{3}.$$Since the fence requires a total of $240$ square feet to be painted,\n\n$$x+y=240.$$Substituting $y=\\frac{5x}{3}$ into this equation, we get\n\n$$x+\\frac{5x}{3}=240\\Rightarrow \\frac{8x}{3}=240$$$$\\Rightarrow x=240\\cdot \\frac{3}{8}=90.$$Therefore, Ben paints\n\n$$y=\\frac{5x}{3}=\\frac{5\\cdot 90}{3}=150$$square feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Between them, Allen and Ben are dividing the work into $8$ equal parts, $3$ of which Allen does and $5$ of which Ben does. Each part of the work requires $\\frac{240}{8} = 30$ square feet to be painted. Since Ben does $5$ parts of the work, he will paint $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ square feet of the fence."
