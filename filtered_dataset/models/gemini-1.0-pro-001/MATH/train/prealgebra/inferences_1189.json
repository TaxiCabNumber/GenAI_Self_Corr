At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the 36 students in Richelle's class, 12 prefer chocolate pie, 8 prefer apple, and 6 prefer blueberry.  Half of the remaining students prefer cherry pie and half prefer lemon.  For Richelle's pie graph showing this data, how many degrees should she use for cherry pie?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total number of students who prefer cherry pie:\n* Half of the remaining students prefer cherry pie, so 36 - 12 - 8 - 6 = 10 students prefer cherry pie.\n\n2. Determine the fraction of students who prefer cherry pie:\n* 10 students out of 36 total students: 10/36 = 5/18\n\n3. Calculate the number of degrees for cherry pie on the pie graph:\n* A full circle is 360 degrees, so the fraction of the circle for cherry pie is 5/18 * 360 = 100 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{100}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $12 + 8 + 6 = 26$, there are $36-26= 10$ children who prefer cherry or lemon pie.  These ten are divided into equal parts of 5 each.\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\times 360^{\\circ} = 5 \\times 10^{\\circ} = \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}. \\]"
