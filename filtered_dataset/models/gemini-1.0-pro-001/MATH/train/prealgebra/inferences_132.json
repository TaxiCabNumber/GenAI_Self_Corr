At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA trapezoid has one base equal to twice its height, $x$, and the other base is three times as long as the height. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of the height $x$.",
        "inference": "The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: $A = \\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases.\nIn this problem, one base is equal to twice the height, so $b_1 = 2x$. The other base is three times the height, so $b_2 = 3x$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the area, we get:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}x(2x + 3x) = \\frac{1}{2}x(5x) = \\frac{5}{2}x^2$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}x^2}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{2x+3x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{5x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$."
