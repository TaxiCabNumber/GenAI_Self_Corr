        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWanda, Darren, Beatrice, and Chi are tutors in the school math lab. Their schedule is as follows: Darren works every third school day, Wanda works every fourth school day, Beatrice works every sixth school day, and Chi works every seventh school day. Today they are all working in the math lab. In how many school days from today will they next be together tutoring in the lab?",
        "inference": "Wanda works every 4th school day, Darren works every 3rd school day, Beatrice works every 6th school day, and Chi works every 7th school day. We want to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 6, and 7, which is the smallest number that is divisible by all four of these numbers.\n**Step 1:** Prime factorize each number.\n* 3 = 3\n* 4 = 2^2\n* 6 = 2 x 3\n* 7 = 7\n**Step 2:** Find the LCM of these prime factors.\n* LCM = 2^2 x 3 x 7 = 84\n**Step 3:** The LCM is 84, which is the smallest number that is divisible by all four of these numbers. Therefore, Wanda, Darren, Beatrice, and Chi will next be together tutoring in the lab in $\\boxed{84}$ school days from today.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of school days until they will next be together is the least common multiple of $3$, $4$, $6$, and $7$. Since $3$, $4 = 2^2$, and $7$ are all powers of different primes, the least common multiple of these prime powers is $3 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 7 = 84$. The number $6$ also happens to be a factor of $84$, so $\\boxed{84}$ is the least common multiple of $3$, $4$, $6$, and $7$."
