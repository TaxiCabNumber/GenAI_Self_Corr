        "inference": "Since $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon, the interior angle of it is $\\frac{(6-2)180}{6} = 120\u00b0$. Since $\\triangle ABP$ is an isosceles triangle, the angle opposite side $\\overline{BP}$ is equal to $180\u00b0-120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0$. Since angles $FPE$ and $PFE$ are adjacent angles, they form a linear pair, so they add up to $180\u00b0$, so $FPE = 180\u00b0 - PFE = 180\u00b0-60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0$. Since angles $PFE$ and $PBP$ are vertical angles, they are equal: $PFE = PBP = 60\u00b0$. Thus angle $P$ is $180\u00b0-2PBP = 180\u00b0-2(60\u00b0) = 180\u00b0-120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.",
