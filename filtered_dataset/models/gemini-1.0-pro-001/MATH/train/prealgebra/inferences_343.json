At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery week, Judy goes to the supermarket and buys the following: $5$ carrots at $\\$1$ each, $3$ bottles of milk at $\\$3$ each, $2$ pineapples at $\\$4$ each, $2$ bags of flour at $\\$5$ each, and a giant $\\$7$ container of ice cream. This week the store has a sale and pineapples are half price. Judy also has a coupon for $\\$5$ off any order of $\\$25$ or over. How much money does Judy spend on this shopping trip?",
