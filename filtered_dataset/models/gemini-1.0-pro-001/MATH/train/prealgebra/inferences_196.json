        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bus can hold a maximum of 38 students. What is the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students?",
        "inference": "- First, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus to get the number of buses needed.\n411 / 38 = 10.81578947368421\n\n- Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$11$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $n$ buses will carry $38n$ students, we need $38n>411$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $38$, we have $n>\\dfrac{411}{38}$. We can convert $\\dfrac{411}{38}$ to a mixed number: $$\\frac{411}{38} = \\frac{380}{38}+\\frac{31}{38} = 10\\frac{31}{38}.$$ Since the number of buses must be an integer, the smallest possible number of buses is $\\boxed{11}$."
