        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA designer has 3 fabric colors he may use for a dress: red, green, and blue. Four different patterns are available for the dress. If each dress design requires exactly one color and one pattern, how many different dress designs are possible?",
        "inference": "1. The number of color choices is 3.\n2. The number of pattern choices is 4.\n3. The number of possible dress designs is the product of the number of color choices and the number of pattern choices.\n4. Number of possible dress designs = 3 * 4 = 12.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For each fabric color, the designer can choose one of four patterns. Thus, as there are three potential fabric colors, the designer can create $3 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{12}$ different dress designs."
