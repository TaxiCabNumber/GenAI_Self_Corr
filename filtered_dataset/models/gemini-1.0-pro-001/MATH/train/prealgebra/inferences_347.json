At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

In this case, the sum of the digits of $1C3$ is $1 + C + 3 = C + 4$.\n\nFor $1C3$ to be a multiple of 3, $C + 4$ must be a multiple of 3. The only digits that make $C + 4$ a multiple of 3 are $C = 2$ and $C = 5$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ digits $C$ for which $1C3$ is a multiple of 3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$.
