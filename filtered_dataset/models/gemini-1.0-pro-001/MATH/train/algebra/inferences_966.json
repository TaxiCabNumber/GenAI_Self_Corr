At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCorn costs 99 cents per pound, and beans cost 45 cents per pound. If Shea buys 24 total pounds of corn and beans, and it costs $\\$18.09$, how many pounds of corn did Shea buy? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "Let \\( x \\) be the pounds of corn Shea bought. Then the pounds of beans is \\(24 - x\\).\n\n* Cost of Corn: $0.99x$\n* Cost of Beans: $0.45(24 - x) = 10.8 - 0.45x$\n\n* The total cost is $18.09:\n\n$$0.99x + 10.8 - 0.45x = 18.09$$\n\n* Simplifying \n\n$$0.54x = 7.29$$\n\n* Divide both sides by 0.54:\n\n$$x = \\frac{7.29}{0.54} \\approx 13.5$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$13.5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ and $b$ be the number of pounds of corn and beans Shea buys, respectively. We can turn the givens into a two-variable, linear system: \\begin{align*}\nb+c&=24\\\\\n45b+99c&=1809\n\\end{align*} We can multiply the first equation by 45 and subtract it from the second to get $(99-45)c=1809-45(24)$, which reduces to $54c=729$ or $c=13.5$. So Shea buys $\\boxed{13.5\\text{ pounds}}$ of corn."
