        "ground_truth": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \\dots + 40 = 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.

The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is equal to $(1 + 29)/2 \\cdot 15 = 225$.  The positive difference between these sums is $420 - 225 = \\boxed{195}$."
