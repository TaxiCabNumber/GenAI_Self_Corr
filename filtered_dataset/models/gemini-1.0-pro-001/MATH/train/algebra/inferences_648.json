At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA horse 24 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 32 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 8 feet from the center have to make?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Determine the distance traveled by the first horse.**\nDistance = Number of revolutions * Circumference\nCircumference = 2 * \u03c0 * Radius\nDistance = 32 * 2 * \u03c0 * 24 ft\nDistance = 768\u03c0 ft\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the radius for the second horse.**\nRatio of distances = Ratio of radii\nDistance2 / Distance1 = Radius2 / Radius1\n768\u03c0 ft / (Distance2) = 8 ft / 24 ft\nDistance2 = 24\u03c0 ft\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of revolutions for the second horse.**\nDistance2 = Number of revolutions2 * Circumference2\nCircumference2 = 2 * \u03c0 * Radius2\n24\u03c0 ft = Number of revolutions2 * 2 * \u03c0 * 8 ft\nNumber of revolutions2 = 6\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 3 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $32\\times3=\\boxed{96}$ revolutions."
