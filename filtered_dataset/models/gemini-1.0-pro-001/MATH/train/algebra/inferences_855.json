At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a map, a 12-centimeter length represents 72 kilometers.  How many kilometers does a 17-centimeter length represent?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of kilometers represented by a 17-centimeter length. We can set up a proportion to solve for x:\n\n12/72 = 17/x\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n12 * x = 17 * 72\n12x = 1224\nx = 1224/12\nx = 102\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$102$}. I hope it is correct.**",
