        "inference": "The distance between the point $(3\\sqrt{5},d+3)$ and the origin $(0,0)$ is given by the formula:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5} - 0)^2 + (d+3 - 0)^2}$$\n\n$$= \\sqrt{45 + d^2 + 6d + 9}$$\n\n$$= \\sqrt{54 + d^2 + 6d}$$\n\nWe are given that this distance is equal to $3d$.

        "ground_truth": "By the distance formula, the distance between the origin and $(3\\sqrt{5},d+3)$ is $\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2}$. Setting this equal to $3d$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n9d^2&=(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2\\\\\n9d^2&=45+d^2+6d+9\\\\\n8d^2-6d-54&=0\\\\\n4d^2-3d-27&=0\\\\\n(4d+9)(d-3)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $d$ are $-\\frac{9}{4}$ and $3$. We find that $-\\frac{9}{4}$ is an extraneous answer (since distance cannot be negative), so our answer is $d=\\boxed{3}$."
