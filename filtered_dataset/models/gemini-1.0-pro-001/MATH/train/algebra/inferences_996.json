        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Monday, I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $2t-8$ hours but only earned $t-5$ dollars an hour. As it turns out, we earned the same amount. What is the value of $t$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Set up an equation to represent the amount of money I earned.\n```\n(t-6)(2t-5) = amount earned\n```\n**Step 2:** Set up an equation to represent the amount of money Andrew earned.\n```\n(2t-8)(t-5) = amount earned\n```\n**Step 3:** Set the two equations equal to each other, since we earned the same amount.\n```\n(t-6)(2t-5) = (2t-8)(t-5)\n```\n**Step 4:** Expand and simplify the equation.\n```\n2t^2 - 17t + 30 = 2t^2 - 18t + 40\n```\n**Step 5:** Solve the equation for t.\n```\n2t^2 - 17t + 30 = 2t^2 - 18t + 40\n-17t + 30 = -18t + 40\nt = 10\n```\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{t = 10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since we both earned the same amount, \\begin{align*}\n(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{10}$."
