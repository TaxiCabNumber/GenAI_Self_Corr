At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?",

We know that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the third year, so she sold 2x books in the first year.\n\n\n4. This means she sold 200 - 2x books in the second year.\n\n\n5. The total amount of money she earned in the second year is: (200 - 2x) * 20 = 4000 - 40x dollars.\n\n\n**I hope it is correct: 4000-40x $**",
