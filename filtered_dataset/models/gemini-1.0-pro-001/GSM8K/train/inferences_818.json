At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Sunday Trey is going to do some chores at home. First, he wants to make a To Do list and count up how many things he has to do that day and how long it should take. He has several items under 'clean the house,' 'take a shower' and then 'make dinner.' In total there are 7 things to do to clean the house; 1 thing to do to take a shower; and 4 things to do to make dinner. If everything on Trey's list takes 10 minutes to do, how many hours total will it take to complete Trey's list?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total number of things Trey has to do: 7 + 1 + 4 = 12\n2. Find the total number of minutes it will take to complete Trey's list: 12 * 10 = 120 minutes\n3. Convert the total number of minutes to hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours\nI hope it is correct: 2 hours",
        "ground_truth": "On Trey's list there are 7 + 1 + 4 things to do = <<7+1+4=12>>12 things to do in total.\nEach thing takes 10 minutes to do, so 10 minutes x 12 things = <<10*12=120>>120 minutes.\nAn hour has 60 minutes in it, so 120 minutes / 60 minutes in an hour = <<120/60=2>>2 total hours it will take Trey to complete his list.\n#### 2"
