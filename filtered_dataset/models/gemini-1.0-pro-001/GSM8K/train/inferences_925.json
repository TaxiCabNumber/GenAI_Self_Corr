At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAnn, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?",

Julia is working for 6 hours, which is 360 minutes.\n\n4. She is providing service to 7 customers per hour, so she served 360 * 7 = 2520 customers.\n\n5. The total number of customers served by all three of these women that day is 3360 + 2520 = 5880.\nI hope it is correct: 5880 $customers$",
