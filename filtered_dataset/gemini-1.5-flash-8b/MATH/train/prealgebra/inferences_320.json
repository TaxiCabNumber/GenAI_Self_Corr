        "inference": "Let the altitude to the hypotenuse be $h=3$.  Let the segments of the hypotenuse be $a$ and $b$.\nThen $h^2 = ab$, so $3^2 = ab \\Rightarrow 9 = ab$.\nSince the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite the 30, 60, and 90 degree angles is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$.\nLet the side opposite the 30 degree angle be $x$.

The altitude forms two 30-60-90 triangles.\nIn the smaller 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30 degree angle is $x$ and the altitude is 3. Then $x\\sqrt{3} = 3 \\implies x = \\sqrt{3}$.

Then $2\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{a^2 + 3^2}$, which is not helpful.\n\nHowever, in the smaller 30-60-90 triangle, the altitude is opposite the 60 degree angle.
