At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive toppings for a pizza are available at Polina's Pizza. How many combinations of two different toppings are possible?",
        "inference": "We need to find the number of combinations of 2 toppings from 5 available toppings.\nThis is a combination problem, since the order of the toppings does not matter.\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n$$C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\nIn this case, n = 5 (number of toppings) and k = 2 (number of toppings to choose).\nSo, we need to calculate C(5, 2):\n$$C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$$\nThus, there are 10 possible combinations of two different toppings.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 options for the first topping and 4 options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $5\\cdot4=20$ options. However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{5\\cdot4}{2}=\\boxed{10}$ combinations."
