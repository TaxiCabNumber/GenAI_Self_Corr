At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 3003. How many positive four-digit integers are palindromes?",
        "inference": "A four-digit palindrome has the form $abba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits from 0 to 9.  Since it is a four-digit integer, $a$ cannot be 0.\nThe first digit $a$ can be any of the digits from 1 to 9 (9 possibilities).\nThe second digit $b$ can be any of the digits from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities).\nThe third digit is the same as the second digit, so there is only 1 possibility.\nThe fourth digit is the same as the first digit, so there is only 1 possibility.\nTherefore, the total number of four-digit palindromes is $9 \\times 10 = 90$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Constructing palindromes requires that we choose the thousands digit (which defines the units digit) and the hundreds digit (which defines the tens digit). Since there are 9 choices for the thousands digit, and 10 choices for the hundreds digit, creating $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ palindromes."
