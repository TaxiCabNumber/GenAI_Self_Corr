At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
        "inference": "We want to form four-digit integers using the digits 2, 2, 9, 9.\nThe possible arrangements are:\n2299, 2929, 2992, 9229, 9292, 9922\nThere are 6 possible arrangements.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$."
