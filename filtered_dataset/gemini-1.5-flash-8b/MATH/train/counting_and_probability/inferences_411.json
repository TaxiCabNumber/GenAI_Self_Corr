        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a certain university, the division of mathematical sciences consists of the departments of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. There are two male and two female professors in each department. A committee of six professors is to contain three men and three women and must also contain two professors from each of the three departments. Find the number of possible committees that can be formed subject to these requirements.\n",
        "inference": "1. We need 3 men and 3 women.\n2. We need 2 professors from each department.\n3. In each department, there are 2 male and 2 female professors.\n\nFrom each department, we must choose 2 professors, which could be 2 men, 2 women, or 1 man and 1 woman. Since we need 3 men and 3 women, and we must have 2 professors from each department, we can have the following combinations of men and women from each department:\nDepartment 1: 1 man, 1 woman\nDepartment 2: 1 man, 1 woman\nDepartment 3: 1 man, 1 woman\n\nSo we choose 1 man and 1 woman from each department.\nDepartment 1: $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} = 4$ ways\nDepartment 2: $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} = 4$ ways\nDepartment 3: $\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} = 4$ ways\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 professors from each department (1 man and 1 woman) = $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ ways.\n\nThus, we have 64 possible committees with 1 man and 1 woman from each department.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two cases:\nCase 1: One man and one woman is chosen from each department.\nCase 2: Two men are chosen from one department, two women are chosen from another department, and one man and one woman are chosen from the third department.\nFor the first case, in each department there are ${{2}\\choose{1}} \\times {{2}\\choose{1}} = 4$ ways to choose one man and one woman. Thus there are $4^3 = 64$ total possibilities conforming to case 1.\nFor the second case, there is only ${{2}\\choose{2}} = 1$ way to choose two professors of the same gender from a department, and again there are $4$ ways to choose one man and one woman. Thus there are $1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = 4$ ways to choose two men from one department, two women from another department, and one man and one woman from the third department. However, there are $3! = 6$ different department orders, so the total number of possibilities conforming to case 2 is $4 \\cdot 6 = 24$.\nSumming these two values yields the final answer: $64 + 24 = \\boxed{88}$."
