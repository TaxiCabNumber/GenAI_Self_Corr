At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

This gives us $B'(1-5, 1+2) = B'(-4, 3)$.\n\nTo find the coordinates of $G'$, we translate $G(5, 1)$ five units to the left and two units upward. This gives us $G'(5-5, 1+2) = G'(0, 3)$.\n\nThe midpoint of segment $B'G'$ has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{-4+0}{2}, \\frac{3+3}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-4}{2}, \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = (-2, 3)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-2, 3)}$\n",
