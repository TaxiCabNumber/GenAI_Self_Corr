What is the length of the shortest line segment $\\overline{PQ}$ that is tangent to $C_1$ at $P$ and to $C_2$ at $Q$?",
        "inference": "The circles are $(x-10)^2+y^2=36$ and $(x+15)^2+y^2=81$.  The centers are $(10,0)$ and $(-15,0)$. The radii are $r_1=6$ and $r_2=9$. The distance between the centers is $10 - (-15) = 25$.  The shortest line segment tangent to both circles is the segment connecting the points of tangency on the line connecting the centers. The length of this line segment is the distance between the centers minus the sum of the radii.  Length = $25 - (6+9) = 25 - 15 = 10$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$",
        "ground_truth": "The centers are at $A=(10,0)$ and $B=(-15,0)$, and the radii are 6 and 9, respectively. Since the internal tangent is shorter than the external tangent, $\\overline{PQ}$ intersects  $\\overline{AB}$ at a point $D$ that divides  $\\overline{AB}$ into parts proportional to the radii. The right triangles $\\triangle APD$ and $\\triangle BQD$ are similar with ratio of similarity $2:3$. Therefore, $D=(0,0), \\, PD=8,$ and $QD=12$.
