At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circular spinner for a game has a radius of 10 cm. The probability of winning on one spin of this spinner is $\\frac{2}{5}$. What is the area, in sq cm, of the WIN sector?
