At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",
        "inference": "1. On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.\n2. On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos were taken back, painted white, and put back out on Sue's front yard. So, 18/3 = 6 flamingos were painted white.\n3. On Sunday morning, another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, there were now 18 + 18 = 36 pink plastic flamingos.\n4. At noon on Sunday, there were 36 pink plastic flamingos and 6 white plastic flamingos.\n5. The difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and the number of white plastic flamingos is 36 - 6 = 30.\nI hope it is correct: 30 $answer$",
        "ground_truth": "On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.\nThis left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.\nOn Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.\nAltogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.\n#### 24"
