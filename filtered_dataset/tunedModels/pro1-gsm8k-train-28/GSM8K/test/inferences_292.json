If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?",

Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals Susan works:\n150 minutes \u00f7 10 minutes = 15 intervals\n\n3. Calculate the amount of money Susan earns per interval:\n$5 per 10 minutes\n\n4. Calculate the total amount of money Susan earns:\n15 intervals x $5 per interval = $75\n\nI hope it is correct: $75$",
        "ground_truth": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75"
