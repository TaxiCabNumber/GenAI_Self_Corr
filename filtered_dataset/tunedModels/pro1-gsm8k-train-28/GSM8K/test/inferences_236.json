He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?",
        "inference": "1. Ram buys 25 pens.\n2. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n3. So, he can make 25/5 = 5 full pens from the empty pens.\n4. He now has 25 + 5 = 30 pens.\n5. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n6. So, he can make 30/5 = 6 full pens from the empty pens.\n7. He now has 30 + 6 = 36 pens.\n8. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n9. So, he can make 36/5 = 7 full pens from the empty pens.\n10. He now has 36 + 7 = 43 pens.\n11. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n12. So, he can make 43/5 = 8 full pens from the empty pens.\n13. He now has 43 + 8 = 51 pens.\n14. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n15. So, he can make 51/5 = 10 full pens from the empty pens.\n16. He now has 51 + 10 = 61 pens.\n17. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n18.

So, he can make 73/5 = 14 full pens from the empty pens.\n22. He now has 73 + 14 = 87 pens.\n23. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n24. So, he can make 87/5 = 17 full pens from the empty pens.\n25. He now has 87 + 17 = 104 pens.\n26. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n27. So, he can make 104/5 = 20 full pens from the empty pens.\n28. He now has 104 + 20 = 124 pens.\n29. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n30. So, he can make 124/5 = 24 full pens from the empty pens.\n31. He now has 124 + 24 = 148 pens.\n32. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n33. So, he can make 148/5 = 29 full pens from the empty pens.\n34. He now has 148 + 29 = 177 pens.\n35. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n36. So, he can make 177/5 = 35 full pens from the empty pens.\n37. He now has 177 + 35 = 212 pens.\n38. He uses 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.\n39.
