        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.\nThere are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 outcomes greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.\nThere are 3 even numbers on a die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the difference in probabilities.\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/4. So, the difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.\n\n**Step 4:** Express the difference as a percentage.\nTo express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100. So, the difference in probabilities as a percentage is 1/4 * 100 = 25%.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 25%$",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.\nThe chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n#### 25"
