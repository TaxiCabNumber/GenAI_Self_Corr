At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with \"x\".\n\n1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners there.\n2. She sold 2 more to the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners there.\n3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x - 6)/6 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners there.\n4. She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can write the equation:\n\nx/3 + 2 + x/3 - 1 = x - 5\n\n5. Solving for x:\n\n2x/3 + 1 = x - 5\n2x/3 = x - 6\n2x = 3(x - 6)\n2x = 3x - 18\n-x = -18\nx = 18\n\nI hope it is correct: 18",
        "ground_truth": "First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10\nThen add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12\nNow we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18\n#### 18"
