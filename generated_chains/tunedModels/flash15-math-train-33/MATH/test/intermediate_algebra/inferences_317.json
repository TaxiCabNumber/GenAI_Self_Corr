Because the left-hand side is symmetric with respect to $y$ and $ -y $, any solution to the equation pairs off with another solution to have a sum of $0$. Since $ x^{2001} $ pairs off with a term of $ -x^{2001} $ from the expansion of the second term in the original equation, this is a degree-$ 2000 $ polynomial equation in disguise, so the sum of its roots is $ 2000\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}-0=500 $."
