Since $x^2 - 5 < 0$, we have that $-\\sqrt 5 < x < \\sqrt 5$. From $\\dfrac{x-2}{x^2 - 5} > 0$, we have that $x - 2 < 0$, or $x < 2$. Combining all of these facts, we must have $-\\sqrt 5 < x < 2$.\n\nSo, we must have $-\\sqrt 5 < x < 2$ or $x > \\sqrt 5$. (We can also write this as $x = (-\\sqrt 5 , 2) \\cup (\\sqrt 5, \\infty)$.) The largest value not in the domain is therefore $\\boxed{\\sqrt 5}$."
