At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(z)= \\frac{z+a}{z+b}$ and $g(z)=f(f(z))$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers. Suppose that $\\left| a \\right| = 1$ and $g(g(z))=z$ for all $z$ for which $g(g(z))$ is defined. What is the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of $\\left| b \\right|$?",

In order for $h(z)=z$, we must have $R=0$, $Q=0$, and $P=S$. The first implies $b=-1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$. The second implies $a=0$, $b=-1$, or $b^2+2a+1=0$. The third implies $b=\\pm1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$.\n\nSince $|a|=1\\neq 0$, in order to satisfy all 3 conditions we must have either $b=1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$. In the first case $|b|=1$. For the latter case, note that $|b^2+1|=|-2a|=2$, so $2=|b^2+1|\\leq |b^2|+1$ and hence $1\\leq|b|^2\\Rightarrow1\\leq |b|$.
