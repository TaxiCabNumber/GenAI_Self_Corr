At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of positive integers is constructed by listing the first 4, then skipping one, listing the next 5, skipping 2, listing 6, skipping 3, and, on the $n$th iteration, listing $n + 3$ and skipping $n$. The sequence begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13. What is the 500,000th number in the sequence?",
