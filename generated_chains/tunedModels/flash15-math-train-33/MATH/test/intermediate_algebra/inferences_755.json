        "ground_truth": "Since $f$ is a linear function, it has the form $f(x) = mx + b$. Because $f(1) \\le f(2)$, we have $m\n\\ge 0$.  Similarly, $f(3) \\ge f(4)$ implies $m \\le 0$. Hence, $m = 0$, and $f$ is a constant function.  Thus, $f(0) =\nf(5) = 5$, which means $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$ is true."
