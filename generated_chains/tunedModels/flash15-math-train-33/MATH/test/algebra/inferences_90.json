At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?",

This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$."
