At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo positive numbers $p$ and $q$ have the property that their sum is equal to their product. If their difference is $7$, what is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}}$? Your answer will be of the form $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$ and $b$ don't both share the same common factor with $d$ and $c$ has no square as a factor. Find $a+b+c+d$.",

        "ground_truth": "Let $p+q=pq=s$. Then $(p+q)^2=p^2+q^2+2pq=s^2$. We subtract $4pq=4s$ from both sides to find $$p^2+q^2-2pq=(p-q)^2=s^2-4s.$$We are given that the difference between $p$ and $q$ is $7$, so $p-q=\\pm 7$, and $(p-q)^2=(\\pm 7)^2=49$, so our equation becomes $49=s^2-4s$ or $s^2-4s-49=0$. We can solve for $s$ using the quadratic formula:  \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{4^2-4(-49)(1)}}{2(1)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pm\\sqrt{4(4+49)}}{2}\\\\\n&=2\\pm\\sqrt{53}.\n\\end{align*}Since $p$ and $q$ are positive, we know $s=pq=p+q$ is positive, so we take the positive solution, $s=2+\\sqrt{53}$.\n\nNow we must find $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{q^2}}$.
