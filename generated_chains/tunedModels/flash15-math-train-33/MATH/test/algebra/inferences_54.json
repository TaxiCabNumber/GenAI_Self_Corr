        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{65}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$."
