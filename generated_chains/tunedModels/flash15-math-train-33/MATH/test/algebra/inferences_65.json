At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $m$ and $n$ satisfy $mn=7$ and $m+n=8$.

However, doing so is messy, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + 2mn +n^2 = 64$. We know that $mn=7$, so we can subtract the equation $4mn=28$ to get that $m^2 -2mn + n^2 = (m-n)^2 = 36$. This gives us that $m-n=\\pm 6$ so $|m-n|=\\boxed{6}$."
