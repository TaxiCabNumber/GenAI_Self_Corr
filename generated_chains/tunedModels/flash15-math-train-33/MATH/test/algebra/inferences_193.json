        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular patio has an area of $180$ square feet and a perimeter of $54$ feet. What is the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{450}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Set one side of the patio equal to $a$ and the other equal to $b$, producing two equations: \\begin{align*}\nab&=180,\\text{ and}\\\\\n2a+2b&=54.\n\\end{align*}The second equation can be rewritten as $b=27-a$. Substituting, we have \\begin{align*}\n180&=a\\left(27-a\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n180&=27a-a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-180&=a^2-27a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=a^2-27a+180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=\\left(a-12\\right)\\left(a-15\\right).\n\\end{align*}So $12$ feet and $15$ feet are the lengths of the two sides of the patio. Therefore, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{12^2+15^2}$, or $\\sqrt{369}$. Therefore, the length of the diagonal squared is $\\boxed{369}$."
