At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence?",

(In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles."
