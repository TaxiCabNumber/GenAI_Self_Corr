        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe symbols $\\triangle$, $\\square$, $\\diamond$, $\\clubsuit$ represent four different integers from 1 to 9. Using the equations below, what is the value of   $\\square$ ? \\begin{align*}\n\\triangle + \\square &= \\clubsuit \\\\\n\\triangle + \\triangle &= \\diamond +\\diamond + \\diamond + \\diamond + \\diamond \\\\\n\\triangle + \\triangle &= \\clubsuit + \\diamond.\n\\end{align*}",

        "ground_truth": "For simplicity, replace the triangle with the letter $a$, the square with the letter $b$, the diamond with the letter $c$, and the club with the letter $d$. The three given equations become \\begin{align*}\na+b&=d\\\\\n2a&=5c\\\\\n2a&=c+d\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $b$. We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate $a$, to get $5c=c+d \\Rightarrow 4c=d$. Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are all integers from 1 to 9, we know that $d$ must be either 4 or 8 and $c$ correspondingly either 1 or 2. The first case, $c=1$ and $d=4$, does not work because plugging those two values into the third given equation gives $2a=5$, which is impossible if $a$ is an integer. Thus, $c=2$ and $d=8$. Plugging these values into the third given equation to solve for $a$, we have $2a=2+8\\Rightarrow a=5$. Plugging $a=5$ and $d=8$ into the first equation to solve for $b$, we have $5+b=8 \\Rightarrow b=3$. Thus, the value of the square is $\\boxed{3}$."
