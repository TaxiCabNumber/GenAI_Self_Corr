        "ground_truth": "Adding the first given equation to the second, we have $a+2b+c=5$. Then, subtracting the third given equation from this last equation, we get $2b=10$, so $b=5$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation, we find that $a=3$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the third given equation, we find that $c=-8$.
