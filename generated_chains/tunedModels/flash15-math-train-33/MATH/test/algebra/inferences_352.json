At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers satisfy the inequality $x(3x-4) \\le \\frac{6x^2 - 3x + 5}{10}$?",

        "ground_truth": "We begin by expanding the left side: $$3x^2-4x \\le \\frac{6x^2 - 3x + 5}{10}$$\n\nThen we multiply both sides by 10 to clear denominators: $$30x^2-40x \\le 6x^2-3x+5$$\n\nRearranging, we have $24x^2 - 37x - 5 \\le 0$. The left-hand side can be factored, giving $(8x+1)(3x-5) \\le 0$. Thus, $8x+1$ and $3x-5$ have opposite signs (or are equal to zero). Then $-\\frac 18 \\le x \\le \\frac{5}{3}$, so $x = 0$ and $x=1$ are the $\\boxed{2}$ integer solutions."
