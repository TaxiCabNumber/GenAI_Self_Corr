At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has sum 2000.  A new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has sum 16 times the sum of the original series.  The common ratio of the original series is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",
