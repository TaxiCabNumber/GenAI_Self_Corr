At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA TV screen measures 24 by 16 inches. If each dimension is increased by 20$\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",

        "ground_truth": "Since we're dealing with percentages, the actual dimensions do not matter. Let $l$ and $w$ represent the dimensions of the TV screen. The current area is $lw$. If we increase $l$ by $20\\%$, we end up with $l\\left(1+\\frac{20}{100}\\right)=l\\left(\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{2}{10}\\right)=\\frac{12}{10}l$. Increasing the width results in $\\frac{12}{10}w$. The new area is $\\frac{12}{10}l\\times\\frac{12}{10}w=\\frac{144}{100}lw=lw\\left(1+\\frac{44}{100}\\right)$. The area increases by $\\boxed{44\\%}$."
