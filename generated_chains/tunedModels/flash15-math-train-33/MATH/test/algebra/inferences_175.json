At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBecause of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?",

        "ground_truth": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students.
