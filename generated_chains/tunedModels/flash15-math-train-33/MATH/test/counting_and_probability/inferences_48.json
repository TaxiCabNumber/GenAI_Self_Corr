At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Trilisa takes pictures, they turn out with probability $\\frac{1}{5}$. She wants to take enough pictures so that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$. How few pictures can she take to accomplish this?",

        "ground_truth": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
