I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$ and $\\frac{1}{z}$ are all integers, how many distinct values of $x+ y+ z$ are possible?",

So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum."
