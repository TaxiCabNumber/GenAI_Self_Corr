At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?",

With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team.
