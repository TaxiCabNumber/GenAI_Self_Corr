For each of these ways, there is a $\\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \\cdot 6^n}=\\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \\geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \\geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$."
