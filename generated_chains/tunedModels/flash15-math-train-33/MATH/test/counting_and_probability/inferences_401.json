At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour-digit integers are formed using the digits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Any of the digits can be used any number of times. How many such four-digit integers are palindromes? Palindromes read the same forward and backward.",
