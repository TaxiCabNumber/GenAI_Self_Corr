Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\\frac{6!}{2\\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 30 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{180}$."
