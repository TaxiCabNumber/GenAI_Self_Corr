At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?",

If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$."
