        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.",

        "ground_truth": "Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\\begin{aligned}{{47}\\over{288}}&=\n4\\left({1\\over6}\\right)^2+2\\left({1\\over6}+x\\right)\n\\left({1\\over6}-x\\right)\\cr&=\n{4\\over36}+2\\left({1\\over36}-x^2\\right)\\cr&=\n{1\\over6}-2x^2.\\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\\boxed{29}$."
