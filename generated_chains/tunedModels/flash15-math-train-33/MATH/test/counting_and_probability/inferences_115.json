At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party?",

Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats.
