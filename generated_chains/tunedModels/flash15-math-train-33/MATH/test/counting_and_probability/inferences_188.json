At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
