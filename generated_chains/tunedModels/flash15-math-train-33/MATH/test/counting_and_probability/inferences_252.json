At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 6-sided die is weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll.  (So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \\cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{21}$.
