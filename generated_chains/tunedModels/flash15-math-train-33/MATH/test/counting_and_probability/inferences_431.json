At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
