At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $4\\times 4\\times 4$ open cubical box contains 64 identical small cubes that exactly fill the box. How many of these small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box?",
