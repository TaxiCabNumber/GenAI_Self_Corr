I hope it is correct.'\nBob plays a game where, for some number $n$, he chooses a random integer between 0 and $n-1$, inclusive. If Bob plays this game for each of the first four prime numbers, what is the probability that the sum of the numbers he gets is greater than 0?",

The chance that Bob will get a 0 each time he plays is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{1}{210}$.
