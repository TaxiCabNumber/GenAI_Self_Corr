The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\\dfrac{\\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \\dfrac{252}{1024} = \\dfrac{63}{256}$.
