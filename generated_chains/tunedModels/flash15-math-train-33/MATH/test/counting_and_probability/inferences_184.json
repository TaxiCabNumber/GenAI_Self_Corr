What is the probability that this group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students in the class? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

This is just  $\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot \\binom{25}{2} + \\binom{3}{3}\\cdot\\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.
