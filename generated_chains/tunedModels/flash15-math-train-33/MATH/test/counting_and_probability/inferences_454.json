At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe call a number a descending number if each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.  For example, 863 is a descending number.  How many 3-digit descending numbers are there?",
