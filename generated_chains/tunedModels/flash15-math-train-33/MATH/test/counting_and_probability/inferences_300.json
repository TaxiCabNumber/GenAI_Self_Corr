What is the probability that the product of the two top numbers is greater than their sum? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Then $mn > m+n$ implies that $mn - m - n >\n0$, that is, $$1 < mn - m - n + 1 = (m-1)(n-1).$$This inequality is satisfied except when $m=1$, $n=1$, or when $m=n=2$. There are 16 ordered pairs $(m,n)$ excluded by these conditions, so the probability that the product is greater than the sum is \\[\n\\frac{64-16}{64} = \\frac{48}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.\n\\]"
