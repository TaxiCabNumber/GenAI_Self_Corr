At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA row of 8 light switches controls different banks of lights in a school gymnasium. In preparation for a school dance, students decide that they want either one or two banks of lights on during the dance. How many possible ways are there of setting these 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on?",

        "ground_truth": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$."
