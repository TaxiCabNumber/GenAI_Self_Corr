        "ground_truth": "The probability that two particular dice will show 1's, two particular dice will show 2's, and the other two dice will show neither of those is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{4}{6}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{2916}$. There are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to select two out of the 6 dice to be 1's and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ to select two dice out of the remaining four to show 2's, which means that there are a total of $15\\cdot6=90$ ways of selecting which dice will be 1's and 2's.
