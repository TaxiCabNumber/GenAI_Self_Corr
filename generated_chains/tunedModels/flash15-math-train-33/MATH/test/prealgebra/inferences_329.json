At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAll 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have distinct two-letter postal abbreviations. If a two-letter sequence of letters (such as CO or EE) is chosen at random, what is the probability that it is a postal abbreviation for one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
