        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 20 cars in my building's parking lot.  All of the cars are red or white.  Also, all the cars are either 2-door or 4-door.  12 of them are red, 15 of them are 4-door, and 4 of them are 2-door and white.  How many of the cars are 4-door and red?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{11}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, the number of red 2-door cars is $12-x$, while the number of white 4-door cars is $15-x$.  The sum of the number of red 4-doors, red 2-doors, white 4-doors, and white 2-doors is the total number of cars (20), because each car is contained in exactly one of these categories.  Since the number of white 2-doors is 4, we have $x + (12 - x) + (15 - x) + 4 = 20$, which makes $x = \\boxed{11}$."
