At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStacey is standing in a field. She walks 11 meters west, 30 meters north, 4 meters west and finally 22 meters south. How many meters is she from her starting point?",
