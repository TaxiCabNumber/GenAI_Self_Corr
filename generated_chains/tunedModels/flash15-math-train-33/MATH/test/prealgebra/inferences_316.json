At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSam the Sham is an unfair shoe salesman. He has a pair of shoes that was priced at $\\$60$ last week. To entice customers, he wants to put a \"$25\\%$ off'' tag on the shoes but he still wants the customer to pay $\\$60$ for the shoes. He raises the price of the shoes so that after the $25\\%$ discount the shoes will cost $\\$60$. In dollars, what must the new price of the shoes be before the discount?",
