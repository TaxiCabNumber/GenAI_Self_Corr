At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe mean of four distinct positive integers is 5.

        "ground_truth": "Let the four distinct positive integers be $a$, $b$, $c$, and 13, with $a<b<c<13$. We have the equation $\\frac{a+b+c+13}{4}=5\\Rightarrow a+b+c=7$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be positive and distinct, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=4$. So the smallest integer is $\\boxed{1}$."
