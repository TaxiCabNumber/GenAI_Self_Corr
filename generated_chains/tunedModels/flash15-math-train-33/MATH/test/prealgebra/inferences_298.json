At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 2:30 p.m. during a long drive, Bobbi asks her parents, ``Are we there yet?'' Her mother responds, ``We will be there in 7200 seconds.'' If Bobbi's mother is correct, at what time in the afternoon will they arrive at their destination?",
