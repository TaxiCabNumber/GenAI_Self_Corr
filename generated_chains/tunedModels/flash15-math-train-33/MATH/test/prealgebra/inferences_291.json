        "ground_truth": "The amount she spent on t-shirts is $$15.22 +15.22 = (15+15)+ (0.22+0.22) = 30 + 0.44 = 30.44$$dollars.\n\nTherefore, Sarah must have spent the remaining $67.94 - 30.44$ dollars on sweatshirts. We can organize the subtraction concisely using columns as follows:  \\[\n\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& 6 & 7. & 9 & 4 \\\\\n- & 3 & 0. & 4 & 4\n\\\\ \\cline{1-5}\n& 3 & 7. & 5 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]Our answer is $\\boxed{37.50}$."
