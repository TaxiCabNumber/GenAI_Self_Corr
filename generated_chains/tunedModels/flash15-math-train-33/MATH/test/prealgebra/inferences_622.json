At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy have $36$ apples that they plan to split among themselves in a ratio of $2:3:3:4$, respectively. How many apples will Betty and Cathy have together?",
