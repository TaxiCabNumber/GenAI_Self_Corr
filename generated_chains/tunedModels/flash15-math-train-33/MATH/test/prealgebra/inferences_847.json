At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery student in the senior class is taking history or science. There are $200$ seniors in the class. If there are $126$ seniors taking history and $129$ seniors taking science, how many students are taking both history and science?",

If we add those numbers up, we still have to subtract the seniors that are taking both because we counted them twice.\n\nSo there is a total of $126+129-x=200$ students in the senior class. Solving for $x,$ we get there are $\\boxed{55}$ seniors taking both history and science.\n\nWe can also solve this problem with the Venn Diagram below.
