At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?",
