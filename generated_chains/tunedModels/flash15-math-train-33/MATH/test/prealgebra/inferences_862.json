At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has two sides of length $6$ units each.  What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",

        "ground_truth": "The two lengths of 6 units must be the two bases of the right triangle, because the hypotenuse in a right triangle must be longer than each base. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6\\cdot6}{2}=\\boxed{18}$ square units."
