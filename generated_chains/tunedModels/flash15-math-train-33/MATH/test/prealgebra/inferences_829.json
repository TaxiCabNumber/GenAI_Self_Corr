At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA world-record swimmer and a dolphin compete in a 400-meter race. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, and the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second. When the dolphin crosses the finish line, how many meters is the swimmer from the finish line?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{200}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The dolphin swims four times faster than the swimmer, so it covers four times the distance in a given time. So when the dolphin has swum 400 meters to get to the finish line, the swimmer has swum $400/4=100$ meters, and is thus $400-100=\\boxed{300}$ meters from the finish line."
