At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou begin with $\\frac{1}{2}$ scoop of ice cream.  Since you're hungry, you ask the vendor for $\\frac{2}{7}$ more scoops of ice cream.  Then, you eat $\\frac{5}{8}$ scoops.  How many scoops of ice cream are left on your cone?",

        "ground_truth": "We want to find $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{5}{8}$.  The common denominator is 56, so we try to rewrite each of the three fractions with 56 on the bottom.\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{28} = \\frac{28}{56}$. Also, $\\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{2}{7} \\cdot \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{16}{56}$.

Because 9 and 56 have no common divisors, this is the simplest form, and our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{56}}$."
