Brenda left from the same location, at the same time, and drove along a straight road to Prime at an average rate of 45 miles per hour. How many minutes earlier than Kelly did Brenda arrive?",

Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.
