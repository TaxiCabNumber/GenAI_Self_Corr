        "ground_truth": "A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \\cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\\dfrac{57}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page."
