At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup consisted of several groups of four teams each. Within each group, each of the four teams played each other once. How many matches were there in each group?",
