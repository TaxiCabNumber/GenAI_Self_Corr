Each student chose exactly one of these four options: Basketball, Hockey, Football, and Other. The following statements are true about the graph:\n\n$\\bullet$  The number of students who chose Basketball is three times the number of students who chose Other.\n\n$\\bullet$  Ten more students chose Football than chose Hockey.\n\n$\\bullet$  The percent of students who chose Basketball plus the percent of students who chose Football equal $65\\%.$\n\nWhat percent of the students chose Basketball?\n\n[asy]\ndraw(circle((0,0),1),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(-35),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(137),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(-115),linewidth(2));\n\nlabel(\"Other\",1.2*dir(100));\nlabel(\"Football\",1.5*dir(10));\nlabel(\"Hockey\",1.2*dir(-80));\nlabel(\"Basketball\",1.6*dir(180));\n\nlabel(\"Favorite Sports of 100 Students\",(0,1.5));\n[/asy]",

        "ground_truth": "Since there are $100$ students, the percent of students who chose each sport is the same as the number of students who chose it. Let $x$ be the number of students who chose Basketball. From the first statement, the number of students who chose Other is $\\dfrac{x}{3}.$ From the third statement, the number of students who chose Football is $65-x.$ Combining this with the second statement, $55-x$ students chose Hockey. Since a total of $100$ students were interviewed, we have $x + \\frac{x}{3} + (65-x) + (55-x) = 100.$ Solving, we get $x = 30,$ so $\\boxed{30\\%}$ chose Basketball."
