At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper is folded in half repeatedly (never being unfolded), each time shortening what was then the longer side. What is the length of the longest side, in inches, immediately after the second fold? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
