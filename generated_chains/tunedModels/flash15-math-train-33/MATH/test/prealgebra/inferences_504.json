Thus $$\\frac{64}{7}\\div\\frac{8}{3}=\\frac{64}{7}\\cdot\\frac{3}{8}.$$Then we can cancel out the common factor of 64 and 8 which is 8 and we arrive at $$\\frac{64}{7}\\cdot\\frac{3}{8}=\\frac{\\cancel{8}\\cdot8}{7}\\cdot\\frac{3}{\\cancel{8}}.$$Finally, we multiply the remaining terms (make sure to multiply numerators by numerators and denominators by denominators) and we get $$\\frac{\\cancel{8}\\cdot8}{7}\\cdot\\frac{3}{\\cancel{8}}=\\frac{3\\cdot8}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{24}{7}}.$$Note: 24 and 7 have no common denominators so we cannot simplify the fraction further."
