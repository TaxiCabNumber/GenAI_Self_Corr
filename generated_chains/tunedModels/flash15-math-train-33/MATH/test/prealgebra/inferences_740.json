At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 450 juniors at East HS drink a total of 1500 cartons of milk per 5-day week. If the average senior drinks milk at the same rate as the average junior, what is the average number of total cartons of milk the 600 seniors drink each school day?",

        "ground_truth": "If 450 juniors drink 1500 cartons in 5 days, they drink 300 cartons per day. 600 seniors drink $600/450=4/3$ as much milk as 450 juniors, so they drink $300 \\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{400}$ cartons of milk a day."
