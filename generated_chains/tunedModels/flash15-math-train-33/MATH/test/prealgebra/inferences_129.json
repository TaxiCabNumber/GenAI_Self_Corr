At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBenjamin is trying to break a combination lock. This particular type of lock has 5 digits from 0 to 9, and Benjamin just happens to know that there can be no repeated digits in the code for this type of lock. How many valid codes are there?",

For his third, fourth, and fifth digits, he has 8, 7, and 6 possible choices. Therefore, there are $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{30,\\!240}$ possible codes."
