At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA class of 30 students recently took a test.  If 20 students scored 80, 8 students scored 90, and 2 students scored 100, then what was the class average (the mean) on this test?",
