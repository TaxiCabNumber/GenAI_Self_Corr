At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integers $x$ do we have $\\frac14 < \\frac{x}{5} < \\frac23$?",

This gives \\[1\\frac14<x<3\\frac13.\\]The only integers between $1\\frac14$ and $3\\frac13$ are 2 and 3.  Therefore there are $\\boxed{2}$ integers that solve this pair of inequalities."
