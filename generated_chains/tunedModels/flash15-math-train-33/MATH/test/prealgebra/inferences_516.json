At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a spaceship full of scientists landed on Planet Q, they found that $\\frac{17}{40}$ of the $160$ aliens had $3$ eyes.  How many aliens had $3$ eyes?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{68}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Remembering that \"of\" means \"times,\" the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\\frac{17}{40} \\cdot 160$.  This equals $\\frac{17 \\cdot 160}{40}$, which can be rewritten as $17 \\cdot \\frac{160}{40}$.  Because $160$ divided by $40$ equals $4$, the expression above is the same as $17 \\cdot 4$, which equals $\\boxed{68}$."
