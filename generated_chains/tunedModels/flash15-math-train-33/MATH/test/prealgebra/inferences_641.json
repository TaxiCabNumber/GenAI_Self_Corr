At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA student brings whole cherry and cheese danishes to his class for his birthday. The number of cherry danishes he brings is at least 3 more than $\\frac{2}{3}$ the number of cheese danishes, but no more than twice the number of cheese danishes. Find the smallest possible value for the total number of danishes he brings.",

        "ground_truth": "Let the variable $r$ represent the number of cherry danishes and $s$ represent the number of cheese danishes. We have $$2s \\ge r \\ge 3+\\frac{2}{3}s.$$The left side of the inequality must be greater than or equal to the right side, so we have $$2s \\ge 3+\\frac{2}{3}s\\qquad\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6s \\ge 9+2s \\qquad\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4s \\ge 9 \\qquad\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad  s \\ge \\frac{9}{4}.$$The least possible integer that $s$ can be is 3. The least possible value of $r$ is $$r \\ge 3+\\frac{2}{3}(3) \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad r \\ge 5.$$Therefore, the student brings at least $\\boxed{8}$ danishes."
