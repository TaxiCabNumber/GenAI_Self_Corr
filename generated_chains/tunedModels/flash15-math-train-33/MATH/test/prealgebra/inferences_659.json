At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKathy needs money for her trip to Europe. If she has 300 US dollars in the bank but wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half of it in euros, how many more euros than pounds will she have? Assume 1 pound = 1.64 USD and 1 euro = 1.32 USD, and round to the nearest whole number.",

        "ground_truth": "After Kathy has exchanged half of her money ($300\\text{ USD}\\div 2 = 150\\text{ USD}$) into pounds, she will have $150\\text{ USD}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ pound}}{1.64 \\text{ USD}}\\approx 91.46 \\text{ pounds}$. After exchanging the other half of her money into euros, she will have $150\\text{ USD} \\times\\frac{1\\text{ euro}}{1.32 \\text{ USD}}\\approx 113.64\\text{ euros}$. Subtracting these two values, we have $113.64-91.46=22.18$. Since the question calls for the nearest whole number, we round 22.18 to the final answer of $\\boxed{22}$."
