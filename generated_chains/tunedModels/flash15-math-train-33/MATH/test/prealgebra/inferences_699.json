At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rhombus has a perimeter of $68$ units and one of its diagonals is $30$ units. What is its area in square units?",

        "ground_truth": "If a rhombus has a perimeter of 68 units, then its side length must be 17. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the right triangle that is formed has one leg of length 15 and another leg of length 8. Therefore, the area of one of the right triangles is $\\frac{8 \\times 15}{2} = 60$, so since the rhombus is made up of four congruent right triangles, the area of the rhombus is $60 \\times 4 = \\boxed{240}$."
