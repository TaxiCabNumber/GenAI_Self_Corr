        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLincoln Elementary School has 120 students. Of these 120 students, $\\frac{2}{5}$ ride the bus to school and $\\frac{5}{12}$ have a parent drive them to school. If the rest of the students walk to school, what fraction of students walk to school?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\\[\\frac{120}{120} - \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{5}{12}.\\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.\n\nTo get this common denominator for the fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\\frac{48}{120}$.\n\nTo get the common denominator for $\\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \\[\\frac{120}{120} - \\frac{48}{120} - \\frac{50}{120} = \\frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \\frac{22}{120}.\\]Notice that $\\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\\frac{2\\cdot11}{2\\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{60}}$."
