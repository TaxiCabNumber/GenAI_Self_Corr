        "ground_truth": "The area of the circle inscribed inside the semicircle is $ \\pi r^2 \\Rightarrow \\pi(2^2) = 4 \\pi .$ The area of the larger circle (semicircle's area x 2) is $ \\pi r^2 \\Rightarrow \\pi(4^2)= 16 \\pi$ (the diameter of the inscribed circle, $4$, is the same as the radius of the semicircle). Thus, the area of the semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}(16 \\pi) \\Rightarrow 8 \\pi .$ The fraction of the semicircle that is unshaded is $\\frac{4 \\pi}{8 \\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the fraction of the semicircle that is shaded is $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
