At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}$ can be simplified to $a\\sqrt b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b$ is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. What is $a+b$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since 56 is a multiple of 4 and 126 is a multiple of 9, we can factor squares out of both terms, getting $\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{14})(3\\sqrt{14})}=\\sqrt{2\\cdot3\\cdot14}$. Then, we can factor $2^2$ out of the outer square root to get $2\\sqrt{21}$. Thus $a=2$ and $b=21$, yielding $a+b=\\boxed{23}$."
