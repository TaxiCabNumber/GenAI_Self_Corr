At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a triangle have the same area. If the square has a side length of 6 units and the triangle has a base of 8 units, what is the length, in units, of the altitude to that base of the triangle?",
