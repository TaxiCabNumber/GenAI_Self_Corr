At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn counts up from 1 to 13, and then immediately counts down again to 1, and then back up to 13, and so on, alternately counting up and down: \\begin{align*}\n&(1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,\\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,\\ldots ).\n\\end{align*} What is the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ integer in his list?",

When 5000 is divided by 24, its remainder is 8. Therefore we see the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\\boxed{8}$."
