Since a positive number must have at least one digit which is not 0, the number we're looking for is forced to have at least 9 ones among its digits.\n\nThe number we're looking for must also be divisible by 50, which means that it ends in 50 or 00. Since the digit 5 is not allowed, our number must end in 00, which means the smallest candidate is  $\\boxed{11,\\! 111,\\! 111,\\! 100}$. In fact, because 9 and 50 $\\emph{do}$ divide this number, and because 450 is the least common multiple of 9 and 50, we know that 450 does divide 11,111,111,100; so that number is the correct answer."
