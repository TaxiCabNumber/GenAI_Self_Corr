I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n=1d41_8$, where $d$ represents a base-8 digit (and $1d41_8$ represents a four-digit number whose second digit is $d$), then what is the sum of all possible values of $n$ in base 10?",

Since the possible values of $d$ are 0, 1, 2,..., 7, the possible values of $n$ form an arithmetic series with first term 545 and last term $545+64\\cdot 7 = 993$.
