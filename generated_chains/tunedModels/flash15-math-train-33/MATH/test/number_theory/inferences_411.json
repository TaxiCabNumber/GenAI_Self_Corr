At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Note that $400 = 4 \\cdot 10^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 10^2 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\\frac{141}{400} = \\frac{141}{2^4 \\cdot 5^2}$. If we multiply this fraction by $10^4$, we shift all digits $4$ places to the left, so $\\frac{141}{2^4 \\cdot 5^2} \\cdot 10^4 = 141 \\cdot 5^2 = 3525$. The last nonzero digit is therefore $\\boxed{5}$."
