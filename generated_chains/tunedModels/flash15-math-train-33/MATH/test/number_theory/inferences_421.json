Since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, the odd one will have to be a perfect square, and the even one will have to be twice a perfect square. Thus we are looking for solutions to $a^2-2b^2=\\pm 1$ where $a^2 \\ge 4$. It's clear $b=1$ does not work, but trying $b=2$, we find that $2(2^2)+1=9=3^2$. Therefore, $n=2(2^2)=\\boxed{8}$ is the smallest solution. We may confirm our answer by checking that $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2=36^2$ when $n=8$, and indeed $36^2=6^4$ is a perfect fourth power."
