At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has integer side lengths. One pair of opposite sides is increased by $30\\%$ and the other pair of sides is decreased by $20\\%$. The new side lengths are also integers. What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of the new rectangle?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the original side lengths.  The new side lengths are $1.3a=13a/10$ and $0.8b=4b/5$.  Therefore, the smallest possible integer values of $a$ and $b$ are $a=10$ and $b=5$.
