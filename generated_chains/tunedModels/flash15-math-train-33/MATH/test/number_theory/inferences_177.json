At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84. What is the least possible sum of these integers?",

The set with the smallest sum would be the factors themselves - 2, 2, 3, and 7. However, the set can't have two 2's since the integers must be distinct, but it can have a 4, 3, and 7 instead.  The sum of those numbers is $\\boxed{14}$.  We could also have paired one of the 2's with the 3, to have 2, 6, and 7, but these have sum 15.  Grouping the extra 2 with 7 gives 2, 3, and 14 (which sum to 19), and any other grouping clearly gives a sum higher than 14."
