Thus we have $10A+B=A+B+AB\\Leftrightarrow9A=AB$. Now since $AB$ is a two-digit integer, $A\\ne0$, so we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $9=B$. Therefore, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, and 99 all have the property. Their arithmetic mean is $\\frac{\\frac{9(19+99)}{2}}{9}=\\frac{19+99}{2}=\\boxed{59}$."
