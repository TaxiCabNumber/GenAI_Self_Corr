The largest possible 4-digit palindrome in base 3 can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in another base $b>2$. What is $b$?",

We know that converting $80_{10}$ to other bases will result in 3 digits when the base is from 5 to 8, inclusive, since $4^3<80<9^2$, meaning $1000_4<80<100_9$. Converting to other bases, we get $310_5, 212_6, 143_7, 120_8$. The only palindrome is $212_6$, which is expressed in base $\\boxed{6}$."
