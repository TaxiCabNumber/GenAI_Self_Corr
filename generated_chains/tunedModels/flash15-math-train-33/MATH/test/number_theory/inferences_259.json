        "ground_truth": "To find the pattern of the sequence, we begin by converting each of the decimal values into a common fraction. The first term $0$ is equal to $\\frac{0}{1}$.

The fourth term in the series, $0.75$, becomes $\\frac{75}{100}=\\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, when we write fractions instead of decimals, our sequence is: $$\\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\cdots$$  By observing this sequence, we realize that the first term of the sequence is $\\frac{0}{1}$ and each successive term is found by adding $1$ to both the numerator and denominator of the previous term. Thus, the next term in the sequence is $\\frac{3+1}{4+1}=\\frac{4}{5}=\\boxed{0.8}$."
