At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?",
