I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the expression $(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})$ is written as an integer, what is the product of the tens digit and the ones digit?",

The desired product is $2^{1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 99 + 100} = 2^{5050}$.  If we can find $x_{5050}$, we will then be done.  But since $5050 = 20\\cdot 252 + 10$, we see that $x_{5050} = x_{10} = 24$.
