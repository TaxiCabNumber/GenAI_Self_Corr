At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWalter, Agnes, and Holly are making beaded lizards. Walter has 476 green beads and 32 red beads. Agnes has 104 green beads and 16 red beads. Holly has 281 green beads and 80 red beads. They all share their beads so as to make the largest possible number of lizards.  If a beaded lizard requires 94 green beads and 16 red beads, what is the number of green beads left over?",

        "ground_truth": "We have $476+104+281 \\equiv 6+10+93 \\equiv 109 \\pmod{94}\\equiv 15\\pmod{94}$.\n\nThere are, however, only $32+16+80$ red beads, which is only enough to make $\\frac{32+16+80}{16} = 2+1+5 = 8$ lizards, and $476+104+281 = 15+94\\cdot 9$. Therefore, after the $8$ possible lizards are made, there are $15+94=\\boxed{109}$ green beads left over."
