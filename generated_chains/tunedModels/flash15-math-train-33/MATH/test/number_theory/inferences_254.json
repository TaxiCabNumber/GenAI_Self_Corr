I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of apples that Sophia has is a multiple of $6$. When she sells one apple, the number of apples is a multiple of $n$. If $n$ is a positive integer less than $10$, how many possible values are there for $n$?",

This is solvable for $b$ if and only if $6$ is invertible modulo $n$. In other words, $\\gcd(6,n)=1$. The only such $n$ less than $10$ are $1,5,7$, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ possibilities for $n$."
