It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25."
