        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven $m\\geq 2$, denote by $b^{-1}$ the inverse of $b\\pmod{m}$. That is, $b^{-1}$ is the residue for which $bb^{-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$. Sadie wonders if $(a+b)^{-1}$ is always congruent to $a^{-1}+b^{-1}$ (modulo $m$). She tries the example $a=2$, $b=3$, and $m=7$. Let $L$ be the residue of $(2+3)^{-1}\\pmod{7}$, and let $R$ be the residue of $2^{-1}+3^{-1}\\pmod{7}$, where $L$ and $R$ are integers from $0$ to $6$ (inclusive). Find $L-R$.",

        "ground_truth": "The inverse of $5\\pmod{7}$ is 3, since $5\\cdot3 \\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$. Also, inverse of $2\\pmod{7}$ is 4, since $2\\cdot 4\\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$. Finally, the inverse of $3\\pmod{7}$ is 5 (again because $5\\cdot3 \\equiv 1\\pmod{7}$). So the residue of $2^{-1}+3^{-1}$ is the residue of $4+5\\pmod{7}$, which is $2$. Thus $L-R=3-2=\\boxed{1}$. Since the left-hand side $L$ and the right-hand side $R$ of the equation $$\n(a+b)^{-1} \\stackrel{?}{=} a^{-1} + b^{-1} \\pmod{m}\n$$are not equal, we may conclude that the equation is not true in general."
