At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. If the sum is less than 220, what is the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set?",

        "ground_truth": "The sum of the set $\\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\\boxed{58}$."
