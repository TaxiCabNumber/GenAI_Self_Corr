At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEuler discovered that the polynomial $p(n) = n^2 - n + 41$ yields prime numbers for many small positive integer values of $n$. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$?",
