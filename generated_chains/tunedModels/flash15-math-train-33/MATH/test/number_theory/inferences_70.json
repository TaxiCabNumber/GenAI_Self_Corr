At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Starting with the first triple of primes on the list, add the remainders when each prime is divided by 5 and see whether the sum is a multiple of 5, in which case the sum of the three consecutive primes is a multiple of 5: 2+4+3=9, 4+3+4=11, 3+4+3=10. Aha! This means that $83+79+73=\\boxed{235}$ is the greatest possible sum of three consecutive prime numbers, each less than 100, that have a sum that is a multiple of 5."
