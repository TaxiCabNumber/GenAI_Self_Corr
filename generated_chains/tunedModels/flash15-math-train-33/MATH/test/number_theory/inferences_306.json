At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many more digits does the base-10 number 87 have when expressed in base 2 than when expressed in base 3?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.  The difference between 7 digits and 5 digits is $\\boxed{2}$ digits."
