At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "There are $12$ months in a year.  January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have $31$ days, so there are $7$ months with $2$ days that have a $3$ in the tens digit.  April, June, September, and November each have $1$ day with a $3$ in the tens place, and February has none.  Therefore, there are $7\\times2+4=\\boxed{18}$ days with a $3$ in the tens digit.\n\nAlternatively, this problem can be solved by subtraction.
