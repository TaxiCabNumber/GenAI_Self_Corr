The remainders when these prime are divided by 7 are 2, 3, 5, 0, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, respectively. Starting with the first triple, add the remainders to see whether the sum is a multiple of 7, in which case the corresponding prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. We see that $6+3+5=14$. Thus, the least possible sum is $13+17+19=\\boxed{49}$."
