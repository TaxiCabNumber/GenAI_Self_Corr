At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Multiplying the equation $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ by $z^2 - 1 = (z - 1)(z + 1)$, we get $z^6 - 1 = 0$.  Therefore, every root of $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a sixth root of unity.\n\nThe sixth roots of unity are $e^{0}$, $e^{2 \\pi i/6}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/6}$, $e^{6 \\pi i/6}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/6}$, and $e^{10 \\pi i/6}$.  We see that $e^{0} = 1$ and $e^{6 \\pi i/6} = e^{\\pi i} = -1$, so the roots of\n\\[z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0\\]are the remaining sixth roots of unity, namely $e^{2 \\pi i/6}$, $e^{4 \\pi i/6}$, $e^{8 \\pi i/6}$, and $e^{10 \\pi i/6}$.  The complex number $e^{2 \\pi i/6}$ is a primitive sixth root of unity, so by definition, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(e^{2 \\pi i/6})^n = 1$ is 6.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{6}$."
