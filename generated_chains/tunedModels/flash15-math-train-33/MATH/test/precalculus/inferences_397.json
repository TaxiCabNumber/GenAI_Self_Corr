At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile finding the sine of a certain angle, an absent-minded professor failed to notice that his calculator was not in the correct angular mode. He was lucky to get the right answer. The two least positive real values of $x$ for which the sine of $x$ degrees is the same as the sine of $x$ radians are $\\frac{m\\pi}{n-\\pi}$ and $\\frac{p\\pi}{q+\\pi}$, where $m$, $n$, $p$, and $q$ are positive integers. Find $m+n+p+q$.",
