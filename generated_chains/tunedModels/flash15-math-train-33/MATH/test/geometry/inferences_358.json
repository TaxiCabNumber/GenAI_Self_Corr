At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The circumcenter of a right triangle is the midpoint of its hypotenuse, so the circumradius of a right triangle is half the length of its hypotenuse.  Therefore, the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$."
