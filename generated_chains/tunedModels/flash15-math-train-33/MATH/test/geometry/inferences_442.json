At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a sector of a circle is the sum of the two sides formed by the radii and the length of the included arc. A sector of a particular circle has a perimeter of 28 cm and an area of 49 sq cm. What is the length of the arc of this sector?",

        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the arc of this sector be $s$ cm and the radius of the circle be $r$ cm.  Then this sector is $s/2\\pi r$ of a full circle, and its area is $\\frac{s}{2\\pi r}\\cdot \\pi r^2 = \\frac{rs}{2} = 49$ square cm.  Also, we compute the sector's perimeter to be $2r + s = 28$ cm.  Solving, we find that $s = \\boxed{14}$ cm."
