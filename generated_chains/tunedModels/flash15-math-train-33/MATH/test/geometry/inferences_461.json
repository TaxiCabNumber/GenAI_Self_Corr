At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sides of a triangle with positive area have lengths 4, 6, and $x$. The sides of a second triangle with positive area have lengths 4, 6, and $y$. What is the smallest positive number that is $\\textbf{not}$ a possible value of $|x-y|$?",
