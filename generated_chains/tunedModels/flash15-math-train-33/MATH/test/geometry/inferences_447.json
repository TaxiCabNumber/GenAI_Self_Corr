At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a nondegenerate triangle measure 2'' and 4'' and the third side measures some whole number of inches. If a cube with faces numbered 1 through 6 is rolled, what is the probability, expressed as a common fraction, that the number showing on top could be the number of inches in the length of the third side of the triangle?",
