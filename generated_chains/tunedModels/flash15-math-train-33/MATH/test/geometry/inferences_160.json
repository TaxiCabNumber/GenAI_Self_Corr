At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle in the trapezoid?",

        "ground_truth": "The interior angles of a trapezoid consist of two pairs of congruent angles.  Therefore, if the smaller angle measure is $x$ and the larger angle measure is $4x$, then the measures of the four angles are $x$, $x$, $4x$, and $4x$.  Summing these measures and setting the result equal to $360$ degrees, we find $10x=360^\\circ\\implies x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
