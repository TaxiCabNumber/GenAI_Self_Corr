At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the sides of a triangle are 7, 24 and 25. What is the area of the triangle?",

        "ground_truth": "We notice that $7^2+24^2=49+576=625$. Since $7^2+24^2=25^2$, the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 are the side lengths of a right triangle with legs 7 and 24 units, and hypotenuse 25 units. Thus, we can find the area of the triangle by multiplying $1/2$ by the product of lengths of the bases to get $(1/2)(7)(24)=7\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{84}$ square units."
