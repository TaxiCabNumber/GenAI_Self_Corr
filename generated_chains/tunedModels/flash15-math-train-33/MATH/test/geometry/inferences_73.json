At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA recipe for crispy rice treats results in a mixture that fills a 9-inch by 13-inch pan to a depth of one inch. If a crispy rice treats mixture resulting from 1.5 times the original recipe is poured into a pan that is 10 inches by 15 inches, to what depth, in inches, will the pan be filled? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",

        "ground_truth": "The volume of crispy rice treats resulting from the original recipe is $9\\cdot 13\\cdot 1 = 117$ cubic inches.  Thus the volume obtained by making 1.5 times the original recipe is $1.5\\cdot 117 =175.5$ cubic inches.  So the depth to which the pan is filled is $\\frac{175.5}{10\\cdot 15} = \\boxed{1.17}$ inches."
