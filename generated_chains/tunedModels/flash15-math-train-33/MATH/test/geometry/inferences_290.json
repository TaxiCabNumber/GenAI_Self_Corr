At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?",

        "ground_truth": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$."
