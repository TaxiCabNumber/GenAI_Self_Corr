At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right rectangular prism has a base area one-quarter the base area of a larger right rectangular prism. The height of the smaller prism is half the height of the larger one. What is the ratio of the volume of the smaller prism to the volume of the larger prism? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "The volume of a right rectangular prism is equal to the product of the base area and the height. So if the base area of the smaller prism is $1/4$ the base area of the larger prism, and the height of the smaller prism is $1/2$ the height of the larger prism, the volume of the smaller prism is $1/4 \\cdot 1/2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$ the volume of the larger prism."
