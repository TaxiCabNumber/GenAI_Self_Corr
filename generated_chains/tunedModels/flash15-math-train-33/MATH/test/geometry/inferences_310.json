At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA semicircle is constructed along each side of a right triangle with legs 6 inches and 8 inches. The semicircle placed along the hypotenuse is shaded, as shown. What is the total area of the two non-shaded crescent-shaped regions?

Then we see that by Pythagorean theorem $A + B = C$.\n\nThe area of the triangle plus the area of the two small semicircles is\n\\[A + B + \\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{2} = A + B + 24.\\]But this is also the area we are interested in, plus $C.$  Therefore, the answer is $A + B + 24 - C = \\boxed{24}.$"
