By the Pythagorean theorem, we see that $x^2 + \\left(x-y\\right)^2 = \\left(x+y\\right)^2$.  Dividing through by $x^2$, we find that $1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2$.\n\nRearranging and factoring a difference of squares, we obtain $1 = 2 \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}\\right)$.
