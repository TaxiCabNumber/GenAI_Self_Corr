At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGolf balls are packaged by stacking three balls vertically in a box. Given that the height of the box is 13.5 cm, and that the golf balls are touching each other and the ends of the box, what is the number of centimeters in the circumference of each golf ball? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the golf ball.",

        "ground_truth": "Let the diameter of each golf ball be $d$; we have $3d=13.5$ so $d=4.5$.  The circumference of each golf ball is $\\pi d = 4.5\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{9\\pi}{2}}$."
