At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?",

        "ground_truth": "From ``$3$'' to ``$9$'' is a difference of 6 hours out of the 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$ of the degrees on the clock. From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock. Since the clock has $360^\\circ$, the angle decreases by $\\frac{360}{6}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$."
