At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTheo has one sphere with radius 5; Akshaj has two spheres with radius 2.  What is the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres?",

        "ground_truth": "The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$.  Thus, Theo's sphere has surface area $4\\pi(5^2)=100\\pi$ and each of Akshaj's spheres have surface area $4\\pi(2^2)=16\\pi$, so Akshaj's spheres together have surface area $16\\pi\\cdot 2 = 32\\pi$.  The desired ratio is hence $\\frac{100\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$."
