At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA solid sphere of ice with radius 4 is placed on a hollow cone (vertex pointed down) of radius 4 and height 5. When the ice melts, how much of the water will overflow the cone? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. (For this problem, we ignore the fact that the volume of water decreases when it melts.)",
