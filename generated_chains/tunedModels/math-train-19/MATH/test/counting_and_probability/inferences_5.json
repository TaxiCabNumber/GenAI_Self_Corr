        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nIf Amy eats a chocolate chip cookie first, there are 3 choices for the first cookie, 7 choices for the second, 6 for the third, and so on. This gives 3*7! arrangements. Similarly, if Amy eats a chocolate chip cookie last, there are 3*7! arrangements. If Amy eats a chocolate chip cookie first and last, there are 3! arrangements for the chocolate chip cookies and 4! arrangements for the sugar cookies. There are 3*7! + 3*7! - 3!4! = 2(3*7!) - 3!4! = 2(3*5040) - 6*24 = 30240 - 144 = 30096.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30096}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both."
