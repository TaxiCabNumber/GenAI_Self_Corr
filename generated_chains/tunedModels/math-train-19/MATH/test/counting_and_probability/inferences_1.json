        "inference": "The solution you provided has a logical flaw.  The probability of exactly two dice showing a number other than 1  is not correctly calculated. \n\nLet's break down the problem and fix the solution.\n\n**Problem:**  You want to find the number of dice (n) where the probability of exactly two dice showing a number other than 1 is 25/216.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **Probability of one die NOT showing 1:** 5/6\n* **Probability of one die showing 1:** 1/6\n* **Exactly two dice NOT showing 1:**  We need two dice to show other than 1 and the rest to show 1.\n\nThe probability of this happening for 'n' dice is given by:\n\n* (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^(n-2) * nC2  where nC2 is the number of ways to choose 2 dice out of n.\n\nWe are given this probability is 25/216.\n\nSo, (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^(n-2) * nC2 = 25/216\n\nSimplifying, (5/6)^2 * (1/6)^(n-2) * n(n-1)/2 = 25/216\n\nNotice (5/6)^2 = 25/36 and 25/216 = (25/36)*(1/6)\n\nSo, (1/6)^(n-2) * n(n-1)/2 = 1/6\n\nNow, for n=3:\n\n(1/6)^1 * 3*2/2 = 1/6 * 3 = 1/2\n\nSince this doesn't match the required probability, we need to try n=4\n\n(1/6)^2 * 4*3/2 = 1/36 * 6 = 1/6\n\nThis matches.\n\n**Final Answer: 4**",
