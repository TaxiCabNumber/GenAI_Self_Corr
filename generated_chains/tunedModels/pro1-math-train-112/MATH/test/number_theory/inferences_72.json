At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexa has a mixture consisting of 8 ounces of red jelly beans and 13 ounces of green jelly beans. What is the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans she must buy so that, when added to the old mixture, her new mixture is an integer number of pounds?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the ounces of red and green jelly beans to pounds:\n8 ounces = 8/16 = 1/2 pound\n13 ounces = 13/16 = 13/16 pound\n\n2. Add the weights of the red and green jelly beans:\n1/2 pound + 13/16 pound = 21/16 pound\n\n3. Determine the number of pounds in the new mixture:\n21/16 pound + x pounds = y pounds\n\n4. Find the minimum value of x that makes y an integer:\ny = 21/16 + x\ny = (21 + 16x)/16\nFor y to be an integer, 21 + 16x must be divisible by 16.\nThe smallest value of x that satisfies this condition is x = 3.\n\n5. Convert the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans to pounds:\n3 pounds = 3 * 16 = 48 ounces\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{48}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 8+13=21 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the minimum number of ounces Alexa must add to have an integer number of pounds is $2\\cdot16-21=32-21=\\boxed{11}$."
