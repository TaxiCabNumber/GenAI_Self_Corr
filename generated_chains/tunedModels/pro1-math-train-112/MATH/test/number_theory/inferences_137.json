At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers?",
        "inference": "The sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers is 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 28. The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. The greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers is \\\\boxed{4}.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, and $2n+3$ be four consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)=8n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $8$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor."
