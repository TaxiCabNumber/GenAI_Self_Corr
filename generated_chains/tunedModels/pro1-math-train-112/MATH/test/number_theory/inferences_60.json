        "inference": "A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\n\nA number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even.\n\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $\\underline{374n}$ is $3+7+4+n=14+n$.\n\nFor $\\underline{374n}$ to be divisible by 9, $14+n$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nThe only value of $n$ that makes $14+n$ divisible by 9 is $n=4$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $\\underline{374n}$ is $4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=\\boxed{4}$."
