At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the number of integers $x$ such that $0\\le x< 12$ and $x$ satisfies the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n&x-1\\equiv 1-x\\pmod {12},\\\\\n&x-2\\equiv 2-x\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}",

The second equation is equivalent to $2x\\equiv 4\\pmod{12}$, so $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{6}$. Therefore, $x\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}$ and $x\\equiv 2\\pmod{6}$, which is impossible.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$.
