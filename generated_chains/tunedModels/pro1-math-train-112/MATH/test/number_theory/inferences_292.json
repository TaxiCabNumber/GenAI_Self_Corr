        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA two-digit integer is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$. What is the greatest possible value of $n$?",
        "inference": "The greatest possible value of $n$ is the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $n$. The prime factorization of $10$ is $2\\cdot5$, so the greatest common divisor of $10$ and $n$ is $n$ if $n$ is $2$ or $5$, and $1$ otherwise. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are looking for the greatest possible value of the digit $n$, so let's see if $n=9$ is a possibility. 99 is divisible by 9, so the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
