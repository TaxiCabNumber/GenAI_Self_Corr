At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The smallest such multiple is $a=12$, so $\\sqrt[3]{ax}=\\sqrt[3]{12\\cdot720}=\\sqrt[3]{8640}=20$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 720, which is $2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot 5$. In order to make a perfect cube, we need two more factors of 2, another factor of 3 and two more factors of 5. So if $a=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2$, we have $ax=(2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2)(2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot 5)=2^6\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^3$. That means $\\sqrt[3]{ax}=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$."
