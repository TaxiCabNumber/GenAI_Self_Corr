At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest common divisor of positive integers $m$ and $n$ is 8. The least common multiple of $m$ and $n$ is 112. What is the least possible value of $m+n$?",

Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \\boxed{72}$."
