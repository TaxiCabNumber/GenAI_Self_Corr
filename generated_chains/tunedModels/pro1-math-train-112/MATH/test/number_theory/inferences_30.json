At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The fraction $\\frac{n}{30}$ is a repeating decimal if and only if $n$ is not divisible by $2$ or $5$.  Since $30$ is divisible by $2$ and $5$, the only integers $n$ from $1$ to $29$ that are not divisible by $2$ or $5$ are $1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ from $1$ to $29$ for which the fraction $\\frac{n}{30}$ is a repeating decimal.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization for $30$ is $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5$. Therefore, the decimal representation for $n/30$ terminates if and only if $n$ has a factor of 3 to cancel the 3 in the denominator. There are $9$ multiples of 3 less than 30 (namely $3(1), 3(2) 3(3), \\ldots, 3(9)$) so there are $29-9=\\boxed{20}$ integers $n$ between 1 and 29 for which $n/30$ is a repeating decimal."
