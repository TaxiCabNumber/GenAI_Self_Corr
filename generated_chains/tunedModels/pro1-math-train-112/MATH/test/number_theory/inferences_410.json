        "inference": "Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$. We have $ab = 144$. The least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is $lcm(a, b) = \\frac{ab}{gcd(a, b)}$, and the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $gcd(a, b)$. We are given that $\\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)} = 9$. Substituting $lcm(a, b) = \\frac{ab}{gcd(a, b)}$, we get $\\frac{\\frac{ab}{gcd(a, b)}}{gcd(a, b)} = 9$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{a}{gcd(a, b)} = 9$. Since $a$ and $gcd(a, b)$ are positive integers, we have $a = 9gcd(a, b)$. Substituting $a = 9gcd(a, b)$ into $ab = 144$, we get $9gcd(a, b) \\cdot b = 144$. Dividing both sides by $9$, we get $gcd(a, b) \\cdot b = 16$. Since $gcd(a, b)$ and $b$ are positive integers, we have $gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $b = 16$. Substituting $b = 16$ into $a = 9gcd(a, b)$, we get $a = 9 \\cdot 1 = 9$. Therefore, the sum of the two integers is $a + b = 9 + 16 = \\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.
