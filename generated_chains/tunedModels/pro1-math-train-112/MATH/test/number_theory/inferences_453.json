At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $m$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $m = 24n + 51$. What is the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor of $2m$ and $3n$?",
        "inference": "Since $m = 24n + 51$, we have $2m = 48n + 102 = 2(24n + 51) = 2m$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $2m$ and $3n$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $3n$.\n\nSince $m = 24n + 51$, we have $m = 3(8n + 17)$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $3n$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $3n$ and $8n + 17$.\n\nSince $8n + 17$ is odd, the greatest common divisor of $3n$ and $8n + 17$ is $3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
