        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet S be the set of all three-digit numbers formed by three consecutive digits in increasing order. What is the greatest common factor of all the three-digit numbers in S?",
        "inference": "The three-digit numbers in S are 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, and 789.\n\nThe prime factorizations of these numbers are:\n\n123 = 3 * 41\n234 = 2 * 3 * 39\n345 = 3 * 5 * 23\n456 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 19\n567 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 13\n678 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 37\n789 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 11\n\nThe greatest common factor of these numbers is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "S=$\\{123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789\\}$. Since the sum of the digits of each number in S is divisible by 3, we know that 3 is a common factor of all the numbers in S. Dividing 123 by 3, we get the prime number 41, which does not divide 234. We conclude that the GCF of all the numbers in S is $\\boxed{3}$."
