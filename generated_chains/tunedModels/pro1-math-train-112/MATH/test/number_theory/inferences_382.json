        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe UPC code, made up of numbers and dashes, on a video tape is 9-78094-11006-$x$. The digit $x$ is in the $12^{\\mathrm{th}}$ position. Let $n$ be the value obtained by adding the digits in the odd positions, tripling that sum, and then adding the digits in the even positions. A valid UPC code is such that $n$ is divisible by 10. For what value of $x$ will this UPC code be valid?",
        "inference": "The digits in the odd positions are 9, 8, 1, 1, and 0. Their sum is $9+8+1+1+0=19$. Tripling that sum gives $3\\cdot19=57$. The digits in the even positions are 7, 0, 9, 4, and 6. Their sum is $7+0+9+4+6=26$. Adding the two sums gives $57+26=83$. For the UPC code to be valid, $n$ must be divisible by 10. The only value of $x$ that makes $n$ divisible by 10 is $x=3$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Tripling the sum of the odd digits and adding the even digits, we get $n = (9 + 8 + 9 +1+ 0 + 6) \\cdot 3 + (7 + 0 + 4 +1 + 0) = 33 \\cdot 3 + 12 = 99 +12 = 111$. To make this value divisible by $10$, the twelfth digit must be $\\boxed{9}$."
