        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be x, x + 1, and x + 2.\n\nThen, x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 3x + 3 = 89k, where k is an integer.\n\n3x = 89k - 3\n\nx = (89k - 3)/3\n\nSince x is an integer, 89k - 3 must be divisible by 3.\n\nThe only value of k between 7 and 10 that satisfies this condition is k = 8.\n\nTherefore, x = (89 * 8 - 3)/3 = 296.\n\nThe three integers are 296, 297, and 298.\n\nThe sum of the three integers is 296 + 297 + 298 = 891.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{891}.

        "ground_truth": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. We have $(n-1)+n+(n+1)=3n=89a$ for some positive integer $a$. Since $(3,89)=1$, $a$ must be a multiple of 3, say $a=3b$ for a positive integer $b$. We must have $600\\le89\\cdot3b\\le900\\Rightarrow 600\\le267b\\le900\\Rightarrow2<b<4$. Therefore, $b=3$, which means $3n=267\\cdot3=\\boxed{801}$."
