At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $0.\\overline{1331}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$. Then $1000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $999x = 1331$. Dividing both sides by $999$, we get $x = \\frac{1331}{999} = \\frac{1331}{3 \\cdot 333} = \\frac{1331}{3^2 \\cdot 111} = \\frac{1331}{3^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 37} = \\frac{1331}{3^3 \\cdot 37} = \\frac{1331}{27 \\cdot 37} = \\frac{1331}{1001}$. Therefore, $a = 1331$ and $b = 1001$, so $a + b = 1331 + 1001 = \\boxed{2332}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2332}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$, so $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. As a result, $9999x = 1331$, so $x = \\frac{1331}{9999}$. We can factor out 11 out of both the numerator and denominator, so $x = \\frac{121}{909}$. Thus $a+b=121+909 = \\boxed{1030}$."
