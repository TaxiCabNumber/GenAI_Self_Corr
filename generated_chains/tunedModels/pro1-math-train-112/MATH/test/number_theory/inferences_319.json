At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the expression $(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})$ is written as an integer, what is the product of the tens digit and the ones digit?",
        "inference": "The tens digit is the digit in the tenth place from the right, and the ones digit is the digit in the first place from the right.\n\nThe tens digit of $(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})$ is the same as the tens digit of $2^{100}$.\n\n$2^{100} = (2^{10})^{10} = 1024^{10}$.\n\nThe tens digit of $1024^{10}$ is $4$.\n\nThe ones digit of $(2^1)(2^2)(2^3)\\cdots (2^{99})(2^{100})$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^{100}$.\n\n$2^{100} = (2^{10})^{10} = 1024^{10}$.\n\nThe ones digit of $1024^{10}$ is $4$.\n\nTherefore, the product of the tens digit and the ones digit is $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$.

The desired product is $2^{1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 99 + 100} = 2^{5050}$.  If we can find $x_{5050}$, we will then be done.  But since $5050 = 20\\cdot 252 + 10$, we see that $x_{5050} = x_{10} = 24$.
