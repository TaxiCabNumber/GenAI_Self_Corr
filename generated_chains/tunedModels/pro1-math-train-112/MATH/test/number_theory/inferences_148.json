At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a true-false test of 100 items, every question that is a multiple of 4 is true, and all others are false. If a student marks every item that is a multiple of 3 false and all others true, how many of the 100 items will be correctly answered?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of items that are multiples of 4.\n\nThere are 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100: 4, 8, 12, ..., 100.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of items that are multiples of 3.\n\nThere are 33 multiples of 3 from 1 to 100: 3, 6, 9, ..., 99.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the number of items that are both multiples of 4 and 3.\n\nThere are 8 items that are both multiples of 4 and 3: 12, 24, 36, ..., 96.\n\n**Step 4:** Find the number of items that are correctly answered.\n\nThe student will correctly answer all the items that are multiples of 4 (25) and all the items that are not multiples of 3 (67).\n\n**Step 5:** Subtract the number of items that are both multiples of 4 and 3 to avoid double counting.\n\nThe number of items that are correctly answered is 25 + 67 - 8 = 84.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{84}.

        "ground_truth": "The student will answer a question correctly if\n\nCase 1: both the student and the answer key say it is true. This happens when the answer is NOT a multiple of 3 but IS a multiple of 4.\n\nCase 2. both the student and the answer key say it is false. This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.\n\nSince the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases. So our final number of correct answers is $40 + 2 = \\boxed{42}$."
