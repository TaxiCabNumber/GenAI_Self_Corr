At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "We can multiply both sides of the congruence $6^{-1}\\equiv 6^2\\pmod m$ by $6$: $$\n\\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^{-1}}_1 \\equiv \\underbrace{6\\cdot 6^2}_{6^3} \\pmod m.\n$$Thus $6^3-1=215$ is a multiple of $m$.
