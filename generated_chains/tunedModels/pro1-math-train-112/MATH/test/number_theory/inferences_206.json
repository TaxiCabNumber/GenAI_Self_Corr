At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the arithmetic mean of all of the positive two-digit integers with the property that the integer is equal to the sum of its first digit plus its second digit plus the product of its two digits?",
        "inference": "Let the two-digit integer be $10x + y$, where $x$ and $y$ are digits. Then, we have the equation $10x + y = x + y + xy$. Simplifying this equation, we get $9x = xy$. Since $x$ and $y$ are digits, the only possible solutions are $x = 1$ and $y = 9$, or $x = 3$ and $y = 3$. Therefore, the two-digit integers that satisfy the given property are $19$ and $33$. The arithmetic mean of these two integers is $(19 + 33) / 2 = 26$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{26}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $AB$ be a two-digit integer with the property that $AB$ is equal to the sum of its first digit plus its second digit plus the product of its two digits. Thus we have $10A+B=A+B+AB\\Leftrightarrow9A=AB$. Now since $AB$ is a two-digit integer, $A\\ne0$, so we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $9=B$. Therefore, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, and 99 all have the property. Their arithmetic mean is $\\frac{\\frac{9(19+99)}{2}}{9}=\\frac{19+99}{2}=\\boxed{59}$."
