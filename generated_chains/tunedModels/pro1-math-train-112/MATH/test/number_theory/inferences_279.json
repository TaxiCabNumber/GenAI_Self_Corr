        "inference": "Let $n$ be a positive integer that has three digits when written in base $5$, but two digits when written in base $8$. Then $n$ can be written as $n = 5^2a + 5b + c$ in base $5$ and $n = 8a + b$ in base $8$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. Since $n$ has three digits in base $5$, we have $a \\ge 1$. Since $n$ has two digits in base $8$, we have $a \\le 7$. Therefore, $1 \\le a \\le 7$.\n\nWe can convert $n$ from base $5$ to base $10$ as follows:\n\n$$n = 5^2a + 5b + c = 25a + 5b + c$$\n\nWe can convert $n$ from base $8$ to base $10$ as follows:\n\n$$n = 8a + b = 8a + b$$\n\nSince $n$ is the same number in both bases, we have\n\n$$25a + 5b + c = 8a + b$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get\n\n$$c = 17a - 4b$$\n\nSince $c$ is a digit, we have $0 \\le c \\le 4$.
