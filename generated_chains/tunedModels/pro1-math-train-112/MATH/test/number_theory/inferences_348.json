At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$?",
        "inference": "Since $365 = 5 \\cdot 73$, we need $28n$ to be divisible by both $5$ and $73$.\n\nSince $28$ is divisible by $4$, $28n$ is divisible by $4$ for all $n$.\n\nSince $28n$ is divisible by $4$ and $5$, $28n$ is divisible by $20$.\n\nSince $28n$ is divisible by $20$ and $73$, $28n$ is divisible by $1460$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$ is $n = \\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot7$ and $365=5\\cdot73$, $(28,365)=1$. Therefore, $28n$ is divisible by 365 if and only if $n$ is divisible by both 5 and 73. Thus, the least value of $n$ is $5\\cdot73=\\boxed{365}$."
