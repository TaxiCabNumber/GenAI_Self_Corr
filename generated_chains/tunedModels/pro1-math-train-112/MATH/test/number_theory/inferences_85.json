At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCarlos Montado was born on Saturday, November 9, 2002.  On what day of the week will Carlos be 706 days old? (Spell out the entire day of the week.)",
        "inference": "1. Convert Carlos's birthdate to a day number:\nNovember 9, 2002 is the 313th day of the year (334 days in a leap year).\nDay number = 313\n\n2. Add 706 days to Carlos's birthdate:\nDay number = 313 + 706 = 1019\n\n3. Divide the day number by 7 to find the number of weeks:\nWeeks = 1019 / 7 = 145 weeks and 4 days\n\n4. The remainder of the division is the day of the week:\nDay of the week = 4\n\n5. Convert the day number to a day of the week:\nDay of the week = Thursday\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Thursday}. I hope it is correct.",
