At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the initial number of Penteria.\n\nAfter $506$ minutes, the population will have increased by $5$ every minute, so the total population will be $x + 5 \\cdot 506 = x + 2530$.\n\nHowever, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. So, after $506$ minutes (which is $8$ hours and $26$ minutes), the population will be $x + 2530 - 8 \\cdot x = -7x + 2530$.\n\nWe know that the population after $506$ minutes is $137$, so we can solve for $x$:\n\n$-7x + 2530 = 137$\n$-7x = -2393$\n$x = \\boxed{342}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{342}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$."
