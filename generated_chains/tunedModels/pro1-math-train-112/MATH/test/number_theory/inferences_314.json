At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the decimal $0.1\\overline{23}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.1\\overline{23}$. Then $100x = 12.3\\overline{23}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $99x = 12.2$. Dividing both sides by $11$, we get $9x = 1.1$. Dividing both sides by $9$, we get $x = 0.1\\overline{23} = \\frac{1}{9}$. Therefore, $a = 1$ and $b = 9$, so $a + b = 1 + 9 = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite $0.1\\overline{23}$ as $0.1$ + $0.0\\overline{23}$. The first decimal is simply $\\frac{1}{10}$. Let the second decimal be $x$. Multiplying by 100, we have $100x = 2.3\\overline{23}$, which gives $99x = 2.3 \\implies x = \\frac{23}{990}$. Therefore, $0.1\\overline{23} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{23}{990} = \\frac{61}{495}$. Thus $a+b=61+495 = \\boxed{556}$."
