At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDonut Haven fries donuts in batches of $20$, but sells them in boxes of $13$.\n\nIf Donut Haven fries just enough batches of $20$ to pack $44$ full boxes of $13$ donuts, how many donuts will be left over?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nDonut Haven fries $20 \\times 44 = 880$ donuts.\n\nSince each box holds $13$ donuts, $44$ boxes can hold $44 \\times 13 = 572$ donuts.\n\nTherefore, the number of donuts left over is $880 - 572 = \\boxed{308}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{308}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem using modular arithmetic. Donut Haven needs to fry at least $44\\cdot 13$ donuts. Working modulo $20$, we have \\begin{align*}\n44\\cdot 13 &\\equiv 4\\cdot 13 \\\\\n&= 52 \\\\\n&\\equiv 12\\qquad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of donuts in $44$ full boxes is $12$ more than a multiple of $20$, which means it's $8$ less than the next multiple of $20$. Donut Haven will have $\\boxed{8}$ donuts left over."
