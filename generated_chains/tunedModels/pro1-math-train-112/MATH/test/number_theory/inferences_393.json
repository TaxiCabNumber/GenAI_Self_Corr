At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the first day of a month is Monday, what day of the week is the twenty-third day?",
        "inference": "The first day of the month is Monday, so the second day is Tuesday, the third day is Wednesday, and so on. The twenty-third day is therefore Sunday.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Sunday}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The days of the week repeat every $7$ days. So days $1, 1+7, 1+14, \\ldots$ are all on Mondays. Since day $22=1+21$ is a Monday, the twenty-third day is a $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$. In other words, if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $7$ is $1$, the $n$th day is a Monday. The remainder when $23$ is divided by $7$ is $2$, so the day is one day after Monday. That's Tuesday."
