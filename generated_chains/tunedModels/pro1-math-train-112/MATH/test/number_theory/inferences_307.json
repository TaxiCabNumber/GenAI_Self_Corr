        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 4?",
        "inference": "The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, with initial conditions $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.\n\nWe can use modular arithmetic to find the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 4.\n\nNote that $F_3 = 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, $F_4 = 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, $F_5 = 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, and $F_6 = 8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the sequence $F_n \\pmod{4}$ repeats with period 6, i.e., $F_n \\equiv F_{n+6} \\pmod{4}$ for all $n$.\n\nSince $100 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}$, we have $F_{100} \\equiv F_4 \\equiv \\boxed{3} \\pmod{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we look at the terms of the sequence mod 4, we see that they follow a pattern of period 6: \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4},~\\ldots\n\\end{align*} Then we see that the terms repeat.  Therefore, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term is the same as the $4^{\\text{th}}$ term, and thus has a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 4."
