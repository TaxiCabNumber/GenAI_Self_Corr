At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7?",
        "inference": "Let Rachel's favorite number be x.\n\nWhen she divides x by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. This means that x can be expressed as x = 7k + 5, where k is an integer.\n\nIf she multiplies her favorite number by 5, we get 5x = 5(7k + 5) = 35k + 25.\n\nNow, if she divides 5x by 7, we get (35k + 25) / 7 = 5k + 3 + 2/7.\n\nSince 2/7 is not an integer, the remainder will be 2.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
