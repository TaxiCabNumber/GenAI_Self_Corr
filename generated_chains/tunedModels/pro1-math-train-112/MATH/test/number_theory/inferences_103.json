I hope it is correct.'\nLet $n$ be the smallest positive integer such that $mn$ is a perfect $k$th power of an integer for some $k \\ge 2$, where $m=2^{1980} \\cdot 3^{384} \\cdot 5^{1694} \\cdot 7^{343}$.

        "inference": "Since $m$ is divisible by $2^{1980}$, $3^{384}$, $5^{1694}$, and $7^{343}$, $mn$ is divisible by $2^{1980}$, $3^{384}$, $5^{1694}$, and $7^{343}$ for any integer $n$. Therefore, $mn$ is a perfect $k$th power of an integer if and only if $n$ is a perfect $k$th power of an integer.

We need $n=2^a3^b5^c7^d$ (any other prime factors of $n$ would be superfluous) such that $(1980+a,384+b,1694+c,343+d)$ has GCD greater than $1$ (i.e., we must use $n$ to \"modify\" the exponents of the primes in the prime factorization to get an integer $mn$ which actually is a perfect power).\n\nFirst we search for a prime which divides at least three of the exponents $1980$, $384$, $1694$, and $343$, which would mean we only have to modify one of them (hence have $n$ be a prime power). This, however, is only true of the prime $2$, and the exponent not divisible by $2$ is $343$, which is the exponent of 7 in $m$. Therefore, to modify only one of the exponents, we would need $(a,b,c,d)=(0,0,0,1)$, giving $n=7$. But there is one number less than $7$ which has more than one prime divisor, and that is $6$. Furthermore, $7 \\mid 1694, 343$, and $1980 \\equiv 384 \\equiv -1 \\mod{7}$, so if we set $a=b=1$ and $c=d=0$, we find that $(1980+a,384+b,1694+c,343+d)$ has $7$ as a divisor.\n\nThis gives $n=6$, which is therefore the smallest value such that $mn$ is a perfect power. In this case, $mn$ is a perfect $7$th power, so $k=7$. Thus $n+k=6+7=\\boxed{13}$."
