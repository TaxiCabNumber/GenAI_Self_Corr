At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice is given the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9.$ She must choose a pair of these digits, with the digits being different, to form a two-digit number. How many of the numbers she can construct will be divisible by $3$?",
        "inference": "There are $5$ choices for the first digit and $4$ choices for the second digit. So, there are $5 \\times 4 = 20$ possible two-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$. The possible sums of the digits are $5$, $8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $17$, and $20$. Of these, only $12$ and $18$ are divisible by $3$.\n\nSo, there are $2$ two-digit numbers that Alice can construct that will be divisible by $3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers."
