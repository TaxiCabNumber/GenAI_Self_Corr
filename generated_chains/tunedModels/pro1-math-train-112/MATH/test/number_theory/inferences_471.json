At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The largest power of 5 less than 269 is $5^3=125$. The largest multiple of 125 less than 269 is $2\\cdot125=250$. So the digit in the place for $5^3$ is 2. After subtracting 250 from 269, we have $269-250=19$. We can express 19 as $3\\cdot5^1+4\\cdot5^0$. That means we have a 3 in the place for $5^1$ and a 4 in the place for $5^0$. The base-5 representation of 269 is $2034_5$, so the sum of the digits is $2+0+3+4=\\boxed{9}$."
