On what day of the week did his birthday fall?",

Divide the number of days since Kim's birthday by the number of days in a week to find the number of weeks: 200 days \u00f7 7 days = 28 weeks\n3. Multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week to find the number of days that have passed since the start of the week: 28 weeks \u00d7 7 days = 196 days\n4. Subtract the number of days that have passed since the start of the week from the number of days since Kim's birthday to find the number of days left in the week: 200 days - 196 days = 4 days\n5. Count forward 4 days from Wednesday to find the day of the week on which Kim's birthday fell: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Saturday}. I hope it is correct.",
