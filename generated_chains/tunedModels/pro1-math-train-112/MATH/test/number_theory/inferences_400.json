At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n$N^2$ is a divisor of $8!$. What is the greatest possible integer value of $N$?  (Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)",
        "inference": "Since $8! = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, the prime factorization of $8!$ is $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.  Therefore, the greatest possible integer value of $N$ is the product of the exponents of the prime factors of $8!$ that are less than or equal to $N$.  Since $N^2$ is a divisor of $8!$, the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $N^2$ must be less than or equal to $7$.  Therefore, the greatest possible integer value of $N$ is $2^3 = 8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
