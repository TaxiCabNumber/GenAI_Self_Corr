        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book is said to have $n$ leaves if it is composed of $n$ pieces of paper. On the other hand, the number of pages is twice the number of leaves because each side of a piece of paper is defined as a page.\n\nIf the number of pages in a book is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, and the number of leaves is greater than $100$, then what is the smallest possible number of leaves?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of leaves. Then the number of pages is $2n$. Since the number of pages is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, we have $2n=7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Since $n>100$, we have $2n>200$, so $7k+3>200$. Solving for $k$, we get $k>27$. The smallest possible value of $k$ is $28$, so the smallest possible number of leaves is $2n=7(28)+3=\\boxed{199}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{199}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the least possible number of leaves. Then $2m$ is the least possible number of pages. We know that $2m\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies 8m \\equiv 3\\cdot 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 12\\equiv 5\\pmod 7$. So $m=5+7a$ for some positive integer $a$. The smallest such number greater than $100$ is $5+7\\cdot 14=\\boxed{103}$."
