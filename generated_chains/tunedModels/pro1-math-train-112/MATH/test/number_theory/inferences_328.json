At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf March 1 is a Monday, what day of the week will it be 270 days later?",
        "inference": "1. Divide 270 by 7 to find the number of weeks: 270 \u00f7 7 = 38 weeks and 2 days.\n2. Since March 1 is a Monday, add 2 days to get to Wednesday.\n3. Multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week: 38 weeks \u00d7 7 days/week = 266 days.\n4. Add the 266 days to the starting day (Wednesday): Wednesday + 266 days = Tuesday.\n5. Add the remaining 2 days: Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Thursday}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are $7$ days in a week, we first divide $270$ by $7$ to get $38 \\text{ R}4$. Therefore, there are $38$ weeks and $4$ days in $270$ days. Since it is still Monday $38$ weeks after March 1, we consider the extra four days. Four days after a Monday is a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
