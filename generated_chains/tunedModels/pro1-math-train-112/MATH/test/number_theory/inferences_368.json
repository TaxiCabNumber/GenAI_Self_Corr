        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?",
        "inference": "1. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the number of pencils and the number of bags.\n2. Divide the number of pencils by the GCF to find the number of pencils in each bag.\n3. Multiply the number of pencils in each bag by the number of bags to find the total number of pencils used.\n4. Subtract the total number of pencils used from the original number of pencils to find the number of pencils left over.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. The GCF of 12 and 3 is 3.\n2. 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 pencils in each bag.\n3. 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 pencils used.\n4. 12 - 12 = 0 pencils left over.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Zach has three or more pencils left over, then he can add another pencil to each bag.  Therefore, Zach can have at most $\\boxed{2}$ pencils left over."
