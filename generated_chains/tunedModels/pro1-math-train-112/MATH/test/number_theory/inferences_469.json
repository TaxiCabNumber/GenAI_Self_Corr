(Reminder: For a positive integer $n$, the expression $n!$ stands for the product of the integers from 1 up to (and including) $n$.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe prime factorization of $5!$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nThe greatest odd integer that is a factor of $5!$ is the product of the highest powers of the odd prime factors of $5!$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest odd integer that is a factor of $5!$ is $3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{15}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since a product of odd integers is odd, we can find the largest odd factor of an integer by removing the factors of 2 from its prime factorization. Since the only odd prime factors of 5! are 5 and 3, the greatest odd divisor of 5! is $5 \\times 3 = \\boxed{15}$."
