At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSome positive integers have exactly four positive factors. For example, 35 has only 1, 5, 7 and 35 as its factors. What is the sum of the smallest five positive integers that each have exactly four positive factors?",
        "inference": "The smallest five positive integers that each have exactly four positive factors are 12, 15, 20, 24, and 30.\n\nThe sum of these numbers is 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 = 101.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{101}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The positive integers with exactly four positive factors can be written in the form $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers, or $p^3$, where $p$ is a prime number.\n\nUsing this, we can see that the smallest five positive integers with exactly four positive factors are $2\\cdot 3 = 6$, $2^3 = 8$, $2\\cdot 5 = 10$, $2\\cdot 7 = 14$, and $3\\cdot 5 = 15$.
