        "inference": "Since $n$ has exactly 2 positive prime divisors, we can write $n = p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes and $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n^2$ is $(a+1)(b+1)$.  Since $n^2$ has 27 divisors, we have $(a+1)(b+1) = 27$.  The only factors of 27 are $1, 3, 9, 27$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we have $a+1 \\ge 2$ and $b+1 \\ge 2$.  Therefore, the only possibilities are $a+1 = 3$ and $b+1 = 9$, or $a+1 = 9$ and $b+1 = 3$.  In the first case, $a = 2$ and $b = 8$, and in the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $n = p^2 q^8$ or $n = p^8 q^2$.  In either case, $n$ has $3$ divisors: $1$, $p$, and $q$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime divisors of $n$, so we can write $n = p^a \\cdot q^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.

Since $2a + 1$ and $2b + 1$ are both greater than 1 and are divisors of 27, we know they are 3 and 9 (in no particular order).
