        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Set up a proportion to compare the map distance to the real-life distance.\n\n```\nmap distance / real-life distance = 3 inches / 10 miles\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute the given real-life distance into the proportion.\n\n```\nmap distance / 53.25 miles = 3 inches / 10 miles\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Cross-multiply to solve for the map distance.\n\n```\nmap distance = (3 inches / 10 miles) * 53.25 miles\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Simplify the expression.\n\n```\nmap distance = (3 * 53.25) / 10 inches\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Perform the multiplication and division.\n\n```\nmap distance = 159.75 / 10 inches\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Express the result as a fraction.\n\n```\nmap distance = 159.75 / 10 = 15.975 inches\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$15\\frac{975}{1000}$} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If we let the distance between the buildings on the map be $d$, then $\\frac{d}{53.25} = \\frac{3}{10}$. Cross-multiplying and solving for $d$, we obtain $10d = 159.75 \\Rightarrow d=15.975$ inches. Expressed as a fraction, $d = 15\\frac{975}{1000} = \\boxed{15\\frac{39}{40}},$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{639}{40}}$ inches."
