        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJanuary 1, 2000 was on a Saturday. On what day of the week was January 1, 1960?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Determine the number of days between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 1960:\n\n```\nDays = (2000 - 1960) * 365 = 40 * 365 = 14600 days\n```\n\n2. Determine the number of weeks between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 1960:\n\n```\nWeeks = 14600 days / 7 days/week = 2085.71 weeks\n```\n\n3. Since there are 7 days in a week, the remainder of the division in step 2 represents the number of days in the last partial week:\n\n```\nRemainder = 14600 days % 7 days/week = 0 days\n```\n\n4. Since the remainder is 0, January 1, 1960 was on the same day of the week as January 1, 2000, which was a Saturday.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{Saturday}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Consider a \"normal\" year with 365 days.  Since 365 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, for every normal year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  (For example, if the first day of one normal year is on a Tuesday, then the first day of the next year will be on a Wednesday.)\n\nHowever, leap years have 366 days.  Since 366 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7, a leap year shifts the first day of the year by two days.\n\nThere are 40 years between 1960 and 2000, and $40/4 = 10$ of these years were leap years.  The remaining $40 - 10 = 30$ years were normal years.  Therefore, the first day shifted forward by $30 + 2 \\cdot 10 = 50$ days day-wise.\n\nSince 50 leaves a remainder of 1 by 7, shifting forward 50 days day-wise is equivalent to shifting forward 1 day day-wise.  Since January 1, 2000 was a Saturday, we conclude that January 1, 1960 was a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
