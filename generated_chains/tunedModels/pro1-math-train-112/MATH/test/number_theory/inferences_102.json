        "inference": "1.) $X$ is a multiple of 17, so $X = 17k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n2.) $X$ is less than 1000, so $17k < 1000$. Dividing both sides by 17, we get $k < 58.82352941176471$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $k$ is 58.\n\n3.) $X$ is one less than a multiple of 8, so $X = 8m - 1$ for some integer $m$.\n\nCombining these three properties, we have $17k = 8m - 1$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = 2k + 1$.\n\nSince $k$ is at most 58, the largest possible value of $m$ is $2(58) + 1 = 117$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $X$ is $8(117) - 1 = \\boxed{935}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{935}$.
