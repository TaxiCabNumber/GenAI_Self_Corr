At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn any month with a Friday the Thirteenth, what day of the week is the first day of the same month?",

The first day of the previous month is the same day of the week as the first day of the month before that. And so on. So, the first day of any month is the same day of the week as the first day of the year.\n\nThe first day of 2023 is a Sunday. So, the first day of any month in 2023 is a Sunday.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Sunday}. I hope it is correct.",
