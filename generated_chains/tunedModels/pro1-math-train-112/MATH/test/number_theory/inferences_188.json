At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne morning each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of people in the family.\n\nThen, the total amount of milk is 8x ounces, and the total amount of coffee is 8x ounces.\n\nAngela drank 8x/4 = 2x ounces of milk, and 8x/6 = 4x/3 ounces of coffee.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of milk and coffee that Angela drank is 2x + 4x/3 = 10x/3 ounces.\n\nSince Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee, we have:\n\n10x/3 = (1/4)(8x) + (1/6)(8x)\n10x/3 = 2x + 4x/3\n10x = 6x + 4x\n10x = 10x\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=\\boxed{5}$."
