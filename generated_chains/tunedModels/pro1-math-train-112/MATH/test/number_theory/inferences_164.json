        "inference": "The greatest three-digit integer is 999. The product of the digits of 999 is 9 * 9 * 9 = 729. Since 729 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 996. The product of the digits of 996 is 9 * 9 * 6 = 486. Since 486 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 993. The product of the digits of 993 is 9 * 9 * 3 = 243. Since 243 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 990. The product of the digits of 990 is 9 * 9 * 0 = 0. Since 0 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 987. The product of the digits of 987 is 9 * 8 * 7 = 504. Since 504 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 984. The product of the digits of 984 is 9 * 8 * 4 = 288. Since 288 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 981. The product of the digits of 981 is 9 * 8 * 1 = 72. Since 72 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 978. The product of the digits of 978 is 9 * 7 * 8 = 504. Since 504 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 975. The product of the digits of 975 is 9 * 7 * 5 = 315. Since 315 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 972. The product of the digits of 972 is 9 * 7 * 2 = 126. Since 126 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 969. The product of the digits of 969 is 9 * 6 * 9 = 486. Since 486 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 966. The product of the digits of 966 is 9 * 6 * 6 = 324. Since 324 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 963. The product of the digits of 963 is 9 * 6 * 3 = 162. Since 162 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 960. The product of the digits of 960 is 9 * 6 * 0 = 0. Since 0 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 957. The product of the digits of 957 is 9 * 5 * 7 = 315. Since 315 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 954. The product of the digits of 954 is 9 * 5 * 4 = 180. Since 180 is not equal to 6, we need to find a smaller three-digit integer.\n\nThe next greatest three-digit integer is 951. The product of the digits of 951 is 9 * 5 * 1 = 45. Since 45 is not",
        "ground_truth": "$6=1\\cdot1\\cdot6=1\\cdot2\\cdot3$. To find the greatest three-digit integer the product of whose digits is 6, maximize first the hundreds digit, then the tens digit, and finally the units digit. Of the nine such integers, $\\boxed{611}$ is the greatest."
