At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many base-10 integers are exactly 4 digits in their base-3 representation and exactly 2 digits in their base-6 representation?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIn base-3, a 4-digit number has the form $a_3a_2a_1a_0$, where $a_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. Thus, there are $3^4 = 81$ such numbers.\n\nIn base-6, a 2-digit number has the form $b_1b_0$, where $b_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. Thus, there are $6^2 = 36$ such numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of base-10 integers that are exactly 4 digits in their base-3 representation and exactly 2 digits in their base-6 representation is $81 \\times 36 = \\boxed{2916}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2916}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Base-10 integers that are exactly 4 digits in base 3 range from $1000_3=3^3=27$ to less than $10000_3=3^4=81$. Base-10 integers that are exactly 2 digits in base 6 range from $10_6=6^1=6$ to less than $100_6=6^2=36$. So, for a number $n$ to satisfy the conditions, it must be that $27\\le n <36$. $n$ could be a number from 27 to 35, inclusive, which means there are $\\boxed{9}$ integers that meet the conditions of the problem."
