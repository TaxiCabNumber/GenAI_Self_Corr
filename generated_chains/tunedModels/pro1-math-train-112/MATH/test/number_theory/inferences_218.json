At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat digit must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer $20\\_7$ a multiple of 11?",

For the four-digit integer to be a multiple of 11, the difference between the two sums must be a multiple of 11. Therefore, \\_ must be $9 - \\_ = 9 - \\_ = \\_$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work."
