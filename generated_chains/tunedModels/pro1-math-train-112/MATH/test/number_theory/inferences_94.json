In base $9$, on the other hand, the same number is written as $(2676)_{9}$ and ends in the digit $6$.  For how many values of $b$ does the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ end in the digit $3$?",
        "inference": "The base-$b$-representation of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ if and only if $2013\\equiv 3\\pmod{b}$.  This is equivalent to $2010\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$, which is equivalent to $2\\cdot 1005\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$.  Since $1005$ is divisible by $3$ and $5$, this is equivalent to $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 67\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$.  Since $2$, $3$, $5$, and $67$ are pairwise relatively prime, this is equivalent to $2\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$, $3\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$, $5\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$, and $67\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$.  The first three congruences are equivalent to $b\\equiv 0\\pmod{2}$, $b\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, and $b\\equiv 0\\pmod{5}$, respectively.  The fourth congruence is equivalent to $b\\equiv 0\\pmod{67}$.  Therefore, the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ if and only if $b$ is a multiple of $2$, $3$, $5$, and $67$.  The smallest such multiple is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 67 = 2010$, and the next such multiple is $2010\\cdot 2 = 4020$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such values of $b$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The base-$b$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$ if and only if $2013$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $b$: that is, if $2010$ is a multiple of $b.$ Since $2010 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 67^1,$ it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ positive divisors. However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$). Therefore, the answer is $16 - 3 = \\boxed{13}.$"
