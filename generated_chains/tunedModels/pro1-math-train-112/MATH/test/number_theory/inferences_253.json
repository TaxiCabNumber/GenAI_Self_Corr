Since $11_5-4_5=2_5$, we have $2$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. Next, $11_5-3_5=3_5$, so we have $3$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third digit is 0. We subtract $1$ from $4$ to get $3$ for the fourth digit.
