Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$. Therefore, $100a^2 + b^2 = 100 + 25 = 125$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $a^2 = 4$, we have $100a^2 + b^2 = 400 + b^2$. Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$. Therefore, $100a^2 + b^2 = 400 + 25 = 425$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $a^2 = 9$, we have $100a^2 + b^2 = 900 + b^2$. Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$. Therefore, $100a^2 + b^2 = 900 + 25 = 925$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $a^2 = 16$, we have $100a^2 + b^2 = 1600 + b^2$. Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$.

Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$. Therefore, $100a^2 + b^2 = 2500 + 25 = 2525$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $a^2 = 36$, we have $100a^2 + b^2 = 3600 + b^2$. Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$.

Since $b^2$ is a two-digit perfect square number, we have $b^2 \\geq 16$. The only two-digit perfect square number that is greater than or equal to $16$ is $25$. Therefore, $100a^2 + b^2 = 4900 + 25 = 4925$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nFor $a^2 = 64$, we have $100a^2 + b^2 = 6",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m^2$ and $n^2$ be the two-digit square numbers; we then have $4 \\leq m, n \\leq 9$. Putting them next to each other yields a number $100m^2 + n^2$, which must be equal to some other square $x^2$. Rearranging, we have $100m^2 = x^2 - n^2 = (x+n)(x-n)$, so the RHS contains a factor of 100. The biggest possible square is 8181, whose square root is about 90.5, and the smallest is 1616, whose square root is about 40.2, so $41 \\leq x \\leq 90$. To get the factor of 100, we have two cases:\n\n1. Both $x+n$ and $x-n$ must be multiples of 5. In fact, this means $n = 5$, $x$ is a multiple of 5, and $x-n$, $x$, and $x+n$ are consecutive multiples of 5. Trying possibilities up to $x = 85$, we see that this case doesn't work.\n\n2. One of $x+n$ and $x-n$ is a multiple of 25. Since $x+n = 25$ is impossible, the simplest possibilities are $x-n = 50$ and $x + n = 50$.  The case $x - n = 25$ implies $x + n = 4p^2$ for $(x+n)(x-n)$ to be a perfect square multiple of 100, and thus $57 \\leq 4p^2 \\leq 77$ from $41 \\leq x \\leq 90$. The only possibility is $4p^2 = 64$, which leads to non-integral $x$ and $n$. The case $x + n = 50$ requires $x -n = 2p^2$ for $(x+n)(x-n)$ to be a perfect square. To have $x \\geq 41$ we must have $x - n \\geq 32$, and in fact the lower bound works: $(50)(32) = 1600 = 40^2$. Thus $x = 41$, and $x^2 = \\boxed{1681}$."
