At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat positive five-digit whole number with an 8 in the ten-thousands place is a perfect cube?",
        "inference": "The cube root of a five-digit number is between 10 and 100. The only perfect cube between 10 and 100 is 27. So the number must be 27^3 = 19683.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{19683}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m^3$ be a positive five-digit perfect cube with an 8 in the ten-thousands place. Thus, $8\\times10^4<m^3<9\\times10^4\\Longleftrightarrow 20\\sqrt[3]{10}<m<10\\sqrt[3]{90}\\Rightarrow43<m<45$. Therefore we conclude $m=44$, so $m^3=44^3=\\boxed{85,\\!184}$."
