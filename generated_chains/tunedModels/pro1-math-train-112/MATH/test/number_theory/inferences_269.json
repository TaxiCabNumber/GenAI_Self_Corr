At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a particular list of three-digit perfect squares, the first perfect square can be turned into each of the others by rearranging its digits. What is the largest number of distinct perfect squares that could be in the list?",
        "inference": "The largest three-digit perfect square is 9801. The digits of 9801 can be rearranged to form 1089, 1809, 1908, 8019, 8109, 8901, 9018, 9108, and 9810. All of these numbers are perfect squares, so the largest number of distinct perfect squares that could be in the list is 9.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look at all the possible three-digit perfect squares: 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961. We can find a list with three such perfect squares: 169, 196, 961. However, we can't find such a list with four squares. Therefore, the maximum possible length of such a list is $\\boxed{3}$."
