At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree consecutive prime numbers, each less than $100$, have a sum that is a multiple of 5. What is the greatest possible sum?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive prime numbers be $p$, $p+2$, and $p+4$.\n\nSince the sum of the three numbers is a multiple of 5, it must be divisible by 5.\n\nThe only prime number less than 100 that is divisible by 5 is 5 itself.\n\nTherefore, $p$ must be 5.\n\nThe three consecutive prime numbers are 5, 7, and 11.\n\nThe sum of the three numbers is $5+7+11=\\boxed{23}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{23}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The primes less than 100 are, in decreasing order, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2. Starting with the first triple of primes on the list, add the remainders when each prime is divided by 5 and see whether the sum is a multiple of 5, in which case the sum of the three consecutive primes is a multiple of 5: 2+4+3=9, 4+3+4=11, 3+4+3=10. Aha! This means that $83+79+73=\\boxed{235}$ is the greatest possible sum of three consecutive prime numbers, each less than 100, that have a sum that is a multiple of 5."
