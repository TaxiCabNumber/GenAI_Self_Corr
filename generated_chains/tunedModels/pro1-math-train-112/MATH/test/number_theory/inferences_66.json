At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA base-10 integer $n$ can be represented as $32_a$ in one base and $23_b$ in another base, where $a$ and $b$ are any integer bases larger than 3. What is the smallest possible sum $a$+$b$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $n$ is a base-10 integer, it can be represented as $n = 3 \\times a + 2$ in base $a$ and $n = 2 \\times b + 3$ in base $b$.\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get $3a + 2 = 2b + 3$.\n\nSolving for $a$, we get $a = \\frac{2b + 1}{3}$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers greater than 3, the smallest possible value of $a$ is 4, which occurs when $b = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum $a + b$ is $4 + 5 = \\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}.

        "ground_truth": "We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$.
