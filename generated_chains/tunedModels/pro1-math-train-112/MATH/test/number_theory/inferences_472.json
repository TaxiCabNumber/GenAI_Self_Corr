        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the base-10 integer 340 when expressed in base 7?",
        "inference": "$$340=3\\times7^2+4\\times7^1+0\\times7^0$$\n$$=3\\times49+4\\times7+0\\times1$$\n$$=147+28+0$$\n$$=175$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{175}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If you notice that 340 is close to $7^3=343=1000_7$, then it makes the problem much easier. Since $343=1000_7$, that makes $342=666_7$, or the largest three-digit number in base 7. To get 340, we subtract 2, which means subtracting 2 from the digit in the $7^0$ place. That leaves us with $\\boxed{664_7}$.\n\nAlternatively, the largest power of 7 less than 340 is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 less than 340 is $6\\cdot49=294$. That means there is a 6 in the $7^2$ place. We have $340-294=46$ left, which can be represented as $6\\cdot7^1+4\\cdot7^0$. So, we get $340=6\\cdot7^2+6\\cdot7^1+4\\cdot7^0=\\boxed{664_7}$."
