        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the number of rows in Formation $A$ and $c$ be the number of columns in Formation $A$. Then, we have:\n\n$$rc = 105$$\n\nIn Formation $B$, there are $r + 6$ rows and $c - 2$ columns. The total number of band members in Formation $B$ is:\n\n$$(r + 6)(c - 2) = 105$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$rc - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105$$\n\nSubstituting $rc = 105$, we get:\n\n$$105 - 2r + 6c - 12 = 105$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$6c - 2r = 12$$\n\nDividing by $2$, we get:\n\n$$3c - r = 6$$\n\nSince $r$ and $c$ are both positive integers, the only possible solution is $r = 3$ and $c = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the number of rows in Formation $A$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let there be $x$ rows with $y$ band members per row in Formation $A$. Then we have $xy=105$. From the information about Formation $B$, we have $(x+6)(y-2)=105$. Multiplying and substituting $xy=105$, we get $xy-2x+6y-12=105-2x+6y-12=105\\Leftrightarrow -2x+6y=12\\Leftrightarrow x=3y-6$. We now substitute $3y-6$ for $x$ in $xy=105$ and use the quadratic formula to solve the resulting quadratic equation, $3y^2-6y-105=0$. The positive solution, $y=7$, gives $x=15$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{15}$ rows in Formation $A$."
