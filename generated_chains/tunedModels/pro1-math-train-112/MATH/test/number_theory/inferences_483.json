At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a Tuesday, a magician said, ``I made my wife disappear 31 days ago.'' What day of the week did he make her disappear?",
        "inference": "The magician made his wife disappear 31 days ago. Since there are 30 days in a month, 31 days ago would be the day before the first day of the month. The day before the first day of the month is the last day of the previous month. So, the magician made his wife disappear on the last day of the previous month. The last day of the previous month is the 31st day of the previous month. The 31st day of the previous month is a Monday. So, the magician made his wife disappear on a Monday.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Monday}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $31 \\equiv 3$ (mod 7), he made his wife disappear 3 days before a Tuesday, or $\\boxed{\\mbox{Saturday}}$."
