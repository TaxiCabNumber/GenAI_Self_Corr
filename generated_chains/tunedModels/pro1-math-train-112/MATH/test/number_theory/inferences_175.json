At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTim is doing a cakewalk with $11$ steps. He takes his first step on step $1$ and takes a total of $139$ steps, walking in a circle (so that after the 11th step he reaches the first step again). Which step of the cakewalk does he end on?",
        "inference": "Tim takes $139$ steps, which is $12$ times $11$ plus $7$. So he ends on step $7$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.",
