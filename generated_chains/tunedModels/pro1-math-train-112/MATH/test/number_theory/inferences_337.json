        "inference": "Let the three consecutive prime numbers be \\(p\\), \\(p+2\\), and \\(p+4\\).\n\nSince the sum of the three numbers is a multiple of 7, we have:\n\n$$p+(p+2)+(p+4)=7k$$\n\nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$3p+6=7k$$\n\n$$3p=7k-6$$\n\n$$p=\\frac{7k-6}{3}$$\n\nSince \\(p\\) is a prime number, it must be odd.

Therefore, there are no three consecutive prime numbers whose sum is a multiple of 7.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{There are no three consecutive prime numbers whose sum is a multiple of 7.}",
        "ground_truth": "We are interested in the remainders when prime numbers are divided by 7. The first ten primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The remainders when these prime are divided by 7 are 2, 3, 5, 0, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, respectively. Starting with the first triple, add the remainders to see whether the sum is a multiple of 7, in which case the corresponding prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. We see that $6+3+5=14$. Thus, the least possible sum is $13+17+19=\\boxed{49}$."
