        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive positive even integers be x and x + 2.\nThen, x(x + 2) = 288\nx^2 + 2x = 288\nx^2 + 2x - 288 = 0\n(x - 16)(x + 18) = 0\nx = 16 or x = -18\nSince the integers are positive, x = 16.\nTherefore, the greater of the two integers is x + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $\\boxed{18}$."
