        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet the term $S_n$ be the sum of the first $n$ powers of $2$. For instance, $S_3 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 7$.  Find the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms, $S_n$ and $S_{n+1}$, for any $n$.",
        "inference": "The greatest common divisor of $S_n$ and $S_{n+1}$ is the greatest common divisor of $S_n$ and $S_{n+1} - S_n = 2^n$.  Since $S_n$ is odd for all $n$, the greatest common divisor of $S_n$ and $S_{n+1}$ is $1$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $S_{n+1}-S_n = 2^n$. Also note that $S_n$ is a geometric series with a sum equal to $2^0\\cdot\\frac{1-2^n}{1-2} = 2^n-1$. Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(S_{n+1}, S_n) &= \\text{gcd}(S_{n+1}-S_n, S_n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(2^n, 2^n-1) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(2^n - (2^n-1), 2^n-1) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(1, 2^n-1) \\\\\n&= 1.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms is always $1$, so the largest possible value is $\\boxed{1}$."
