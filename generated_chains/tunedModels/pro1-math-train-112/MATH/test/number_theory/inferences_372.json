At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat value of $k$ makes the positive five-digit integer $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18?",
        "inference": "The number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\n\nThe number is divisible by 2 if the last digit is even. So, $k$ must be even.\n\nThe number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits is $k+3+5+7+k=2k+15$. So, $2k+15$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nThe only even value of $k$ that makes $2k+15$ divisible by 9 is $k=6$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\\boxed{6}$."
