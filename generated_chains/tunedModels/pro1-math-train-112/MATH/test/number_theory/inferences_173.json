At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $k$ is a positive integer less than 6, how many values can $k$ take on such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions in $x$?",
        "inference": "Since $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions in $x$, $k$ must not be a multiple of $3$. The only positive integers less than $6$ that are not multiples of $3$ are $1$ and $5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that the left-hand side is divisible by 3. Therefore, since 3 divides 6, the left-hand side will be equivalent to a multiple of 3. Therefore, if $k$ were to be 1, 2, 4, or 5, then the given congruence would have no solutions. On the other hand, if $k=0$ or $k=3$, then $x=0$ and $x=1$ (respectively) satisfy the given congruence. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ values of $k$ such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions."
