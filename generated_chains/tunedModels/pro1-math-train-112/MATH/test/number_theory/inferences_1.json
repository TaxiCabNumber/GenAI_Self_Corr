        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKirsty needs to hire a plumber to fix her house. The plumber charges $242_5$ dollars for every hour of labor and $367_{8}$ dollars for equipment. If the plumber works for $3.5_{10}$ hours, how many dollars (in base ten) will Kirsty owe the plumber?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the plumber's hourly rate to base ten:\n$242_5 = 2 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5 + 2 = 50 + 20 + 2 = 72_{10}$\n\n2. Convert the plumber's equipment charge to base ten:\n$367_8 = 3 \\times 8^2 + 6 \\times 8 + 7 = 192 + 48 + 7 = 247_{10}$\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of labor:\n$72_{10} \\times 3.5_{10} = 252_{10}$\n\n4. Add the cost of labor and equipment:\n$252_{10} + 247_{10} = 499_{10}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{499}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For every hour of labor, $242_5=2\\cdot5^2+4\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0=72$. For equipment, $367_{8}=3\\cdot8^2+6\\cdot8^1+7\\cdot8^0=247$. Therefore, $3.5(72)+247=\\boxed{499}$ dollars."
