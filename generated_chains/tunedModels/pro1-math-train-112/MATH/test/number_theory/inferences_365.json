        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many of the six integers 1 through 6 are divisors of the four-digit number 1452?",
        "inference": "1 is a divisor of any number.\n2 is a divisor of 1452 because 1452 is even.\n3 is not a divisor of 1452 because the sum of the digits is not divisible by 3.\n4 is a divisor of 1452 because the last two digits are divisible by 4.\n5 is not a divisor of 1452 because the last digit is not 0 or 5.\n6 is a divisor of 1452 because 1452 is divisible by 2 and 3.\nSo, there are $\\boxed{4}$ of the six integers 1 through 6 that are divisors of 1452.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "All numbers are divisible by $1$. The last two digits, $52$, form a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by $4$, and thus $2$. $1+4+5+2=12$, which is a multiple of $3$, so $1452$ is divisible by $3$.  Since it is divisible by $2$ and $3$, it is divisible by $6$.  But it is not divisible by $5$ as it does not end in $5$ or $0$.  So the total is $\\boxed{5}$."
