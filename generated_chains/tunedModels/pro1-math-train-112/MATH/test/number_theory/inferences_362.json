At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $ABC_4+200_{10}=ABC_9$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are valid digits in base 4 and 9. What is the sum when you add all possible values of $A$, all possible values of $B$, and all possible values of $C$?",

In base 9, $A$, $B$, and $C$ can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.\n\nWe can write the equation as $400A + 40B + 4C + 200 = 900A + 90B + 9C$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $500A + 50B + 5C = 200$.\n\nDividing by 5, we get $100A + 10B + C = 40$.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits, the only possible solution is $A = 0$, $B = 0$, and $C = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $0 + 0 + 4 = \\boxed{4}$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{4}.

        "ground_truth": "First we change everything to base 10: \\begin{align*}\n16A+4B+C+200&=81A+9B+C\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n200&=65A+5B.\n\\end{align*}Notice that the $C$ cancels out on both sides, so $C$ could be any valid digit that works in both base 4 and 9 (0, 1, 2, 3). Now we maximize $A$ with $A=3$ and solve $200=65(3)+5B$ to get $B=1$. If we take any smaller value for $A$, then $B$ will be too large to be a digit. So there is only one value of $A$, one value of $B$, and four possible values for $C$. The sum is $3+1+0+1+2+3=\\boxed{10}$."
