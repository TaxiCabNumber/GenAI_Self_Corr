At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a solar system of $n$ planets, Zorn the World Conqueror can invade $m$ planets at a time, but once there are less than $m$ free worlds left, he stops. If he invades $13$ at a time then there are $6$ left, and if he invades $14$ at a time then there are $5$ left. If this solar system has more than $100$ planets, what is the smallest number of planets it could have?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of planets. If Zorn invades $13$ at a time, then there are $n-13$ planets left. If he invades $14$ at a time, then there are $n-14$ planets left. Since there are $6$ planets left when he invades $13$ at a time, we have $n-13=6$. Solving for $n$, we get $n=19$. Since there are $5$ planets left when he invades $14$ at a time, we have $n-14=5$. Solving for $n$, we get $n=19$. Therefore, the smallest number of planets the solar system could have is $19$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$. I hope it is correct.",
