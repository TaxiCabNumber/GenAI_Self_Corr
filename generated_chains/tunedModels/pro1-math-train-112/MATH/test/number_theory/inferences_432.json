At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 4641 can be expressed as the product of two 2-digit whole numbers. What is the sum of these two numbers?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of 4641 is 3 * 3 * 11 * 41. \nSo, the two 2-digit whole numbers are 3 * 11 = 33 and 3 * 41 = 123. \nThe sum of these two numbers is 33 + 123 = 156.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{156}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$4641$ has a prime factorization of $4641=3\\cdot 7\\cdot 13\\cdot 17$. Multiplying any $3$ of its prime factors yields a number that is greater than $100$, so the two $2$-digit numbers must each be the product of $2$ of its prime factors. The only other prime factor $17$ can be multiplied by without getting a $3$-digit number is $3$, so one of them must be $17\\cdot3=51$. That makes the other $7\\cdot13=91$. $51+91=\\boxed{142}$."
