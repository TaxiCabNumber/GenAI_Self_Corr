At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the smallest possible value of $X$?",
        "inference": "Let $X = 3k + 2$. Then the units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of $3k + 6$. Since $3k + 6 = 5(k + 1) + 1$, the units digit of $3k + 6$ is the same as the units digit of $1$. Therefore, the units digit of $X$ is $1$. The smallest possible value of $k$ is $0$, so the smallest possible value of $X$ is $3(0) + 2 = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a positive integer is 4 more than a multiple of 5, then its units digit must be 4 or 9.  We check positive integers ending in 4 or 9 until we find one which is 2 more than a multiple of 3: 4 is 1 more than a multiple of 3, 9 is a multiple of 3, and $\\boxed{14}$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3."
