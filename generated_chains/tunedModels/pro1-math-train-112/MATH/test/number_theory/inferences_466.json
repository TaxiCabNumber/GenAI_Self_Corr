At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has integer side lengths. One pair of opposite sides is increased by $30\\%$ and the other pair of sides is decreased by $20\\%$. The new side lengths are also integers. What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of the new rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the original side lengths be $x$ and $y$.\n\nAfter the changes, the side lengths are $1.3x$ and $0.8y$.\n\nThe new area is $1.3x \\cdot 0.8y = 1.04xy$.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $xy$ is $1$, so the smallest possible area is $1.04 \\cdot 1 = 1.04$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.04}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the original side lengths.  The new side lengths are $1.3a=13a/10$ and $0.8b=4b/5$.

The new side lengths are $13$ and $4$, and the area of the new rectangle is $13\\cdot4=\\boxed{52}$ square units."
