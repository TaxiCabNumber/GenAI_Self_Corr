        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many zeroes does $10!$ end in, when written in base 11?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe number of zeroes at the end of $10!$ in base 11 is equal to the number of times 11 divides $10!$.\n\n11 divides $10!$ exactly $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{10}{11}\\right\\rfloor = 0$ times.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$0$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the base 11 expansion of $10!$ be $a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_1a_0$. This implies that $10! = 11^na_n + 11^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots 11a_1 + a_0$. Note that $10!$ is not divisible by $11$, because $11$ is prime. As a result, if $a_0 = 0$, then the right-hand side of that equation would be divisible by $11$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $a_0 \\neq 0$, and $10!$ ends in $\\boxed{0}$ zeroes when written in base 11."
