So $n$ is a divisor of $455$.\n\nThe divisors of $91$ are $1, 7, 13, 91$.\n\nThe divisors of $455$ are $1, 5, 91, 455$.\n\nThe only common divisor of $91$ and $455$ is $91$.\n\nSo the sum of all possible values of $n$ is $91$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{91}$.

        "ground_truth": "As we are told, we want to find all values of $n>1$ such that $n$ divides into $171-80 = 91$ and $n$ also divides into $468 - 13 = 455$. We notice that $455 = 5 \\cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\\{1,7,13,91\\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = \\boxed{111}$."
