At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three digit numbers are there such that the digits are non-zero, the tens digit is a multiple of the hundreds digit, the units digit is a multiple of the tens digit, and none of the digits are the same?",
        "inference": "There are 9 non-zero digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\nThe tens digit can be any of these 9 digits.\n\nFor each tens digit, there are 3 possible hundreds digits (since the tens digit must be a multiple of the hundreds digit).\n\nFor each tens digit and hundreds digit, there are 3 possible units digits (since the units digit must be a multiple of the tens digit).\n\nTherefore, there are 9 * 3 * 3 = 81 three digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{81}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the hundreds digit is $1,$ there are $3$ possible numbers for the tens digit: $2,$ $3,$ and $4.$ Any number greater than $4$ is impossible because the units digit must be a multiple of the tens digit. Therefore, we have $124,$ $126,$ $128,$ $136,$ $139,$ and $148.$\n\nIf the hundreds digit is $2,$ there is only $1$ possible number for the tens digit: $4$ because any number greater than $4$ would have a multiple that has two digits. Therefore, we have $248.$\n\nWe cannot have any number with a hundreds digit larger than $2$. Therefore, there are $6+1=\\boxed{7}$ possible numbers."
