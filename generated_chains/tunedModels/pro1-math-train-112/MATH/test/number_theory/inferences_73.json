At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2 \\cdot 11$.  Thus, any fraction $\\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms if and only if $n$ is not divisible by 3 or 11.  There are 33 multiples of 3 less than 99 and 9 multiples of 11 less than 99.  However, we have counted the multiples of 33 twice, so we must subtract 1.  Thus, there are $99-33-9+1=\\boxed{58}$ fractions in the form $\\frac{n}{99}$, with $0<n<99$, that are in lowest terms.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{58}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2\\cdot11$. So for $\\frac{n}{99}$ to be in lowest terms, $n$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 11. The possible values of $n$ are from 1 to 98, inclusive, so there are 98 possible values for $n$. We can find the number of multiples of 3 and multiples of 11 and subtract from 98 to get the number of values that aren't divisible by 3 or 11. For multiples of 3, we go from 3 to 96, or $3\\cdot1$ to $3\\cdot32$, so there are 32 multiples of 3 from 1 to 98, inclusive. For multiples of 11, we go from 11 to 88, so there are 8 multiples of 11 from 1 to 98, inclusive. We have to make sure we don't double-count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 11: 33 and 66. So there are $32+8-2=38$ values of $n$ that are divisible by 3 or 11. That means there are $98-38=\\boxed{60}$ values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms."
