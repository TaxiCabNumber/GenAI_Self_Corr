        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYour friend has an egg collection comprising at least $200$ eggs. He wants to store them in dozen-egg containers. After filling as many containers as possible, the last container had $1$ egg left over. He then decided to store his eggs in customized baker-dozen-egg containers, where each container can hold $13$ eggs. It turns out that, after filling as many of these containers as possible, he still has $1$ egg left over. What is the minimum number of eggs that your friend could have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of eggs.\n\nSince the last container had $1$ egg left over, $x$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $12$.\n\n$$x=12k+1$$\n\nSince the last container had $1$ egg left over, $x$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $13$.\n\n$$x=13m+1$$\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get\n\n$$12k+1=13m+1$$\n\n$$12k=13m$$\n\n$$k=\\frac{13}{12}m$$\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, $m$ must be a multiple of $12$.\n\nThe smallest multiple of $12$ that satisfies the equation is $m=12$.\n\nTherefore, $k=13$ and $x=12k+1=12(13)+1=\\boxed{157}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{157}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want the smallest integer $x$ such that $x \\ge 200$ and $x$ gives a remainder of $1$ when divided by both $12$ and $13$. We can write $x = 12 \\cdot 13n + 1 = 156n+1$, so now we need to find a sufficiently large value of $n$ such that $x \\ge 200$. If $n = 1$, $x = 157$, but when $n = 2$, $x = 313$. Therefore, your friend has $\\boxed{313}$ eggs."
