At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe word MATH is repeatedly written producing the pattern MATHMATHMATH... If the pattern is continued, what letter will occur in the 2009th position?",

So, to find the letter in the 2009th position, we divide 2009 by 4 and find the remainder.\n\n2009 \u00f7 4 = 502 with a remainder of 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, the letter in the 2009th position will be the first letter in the pattern, which is M.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{M}.
