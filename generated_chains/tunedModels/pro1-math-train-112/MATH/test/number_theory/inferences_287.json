At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo determine whether a number $\\textit{N}$ is prime, we must test for divisibility by every prime less than or equal to the square root of $\\textit{N}$. How many primes must we test to determine whether $2003$ is prime?",
        "inference": "The square root of $2003$ is approximately $44.74$. The largest prime less than or equal to $44.74$ is $43$. Therefore, we must test for divisibility by $43$ primes to determine whether $2003$ is prime.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{43}$. I hope it is correct.",
