        "inference": "The divisors of a number $n$ are the numbers that divide $n$ without leaving a remainder. The number of divisors of $n$ is equal to the number of factors of $n$.

For example, $4$ is a perfect square because $4 = 2^2$, and $4$ has exactly three distinct positive integer divisors: $1, 2, and 4$.\n\nThere are $31$ perfect squares less than $1000$.
