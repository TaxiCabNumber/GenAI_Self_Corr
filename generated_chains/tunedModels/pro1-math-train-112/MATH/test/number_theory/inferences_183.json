At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the units digit of the positive integer. Then the positive integer is $10B+x$. Since $B6$ is the square of this integer, we have\n\n$$B6=(10B+x)^2=100B^2+20Bx+x^2.$$Since $B6$ is a two-digit number, we have $100B^2+20Bx+x^2<100$. This implies that $B<3$. Since $B$ is a positive integer, we have $B=1$ or $B=2$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$."
