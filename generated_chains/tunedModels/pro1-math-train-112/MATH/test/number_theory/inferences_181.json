        "inference": "The units digit of $16^{17}$ is 6, since $6^1$ has a units digit of 6.\nThe units digit of $17^{18}$ is 9, since $7^2$ has a units digit of 9.\nThe units digit of $18^{19}$ is 8, since $8^1$ has a units digit of 8.\nTherefore, the units digit of $16^{17} \\times 17^{18} \\times 18^{19}$ is 6 x 9 x 8 = 432, which has a units digit of 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}.

        "ground_truth": "We can re-write the given expression as $(16 \\times 17 \\times 18)^{17} \\times 17 \\times 18^2$. First, we find the units digit of $(16 \\times 17 \\times 18)^{17}$. The units digit of $16 \\times 17 \\times 18$ is that of $6 \\times 7 \\times 8,$ or that of $2 \\times 8$, or $6$. When raised to any perfect power, a positive integer ending in $6$ will still end in $6$, so $(16 \\times 17 \\times 18)^{17}$ has a units digit of $6$.
