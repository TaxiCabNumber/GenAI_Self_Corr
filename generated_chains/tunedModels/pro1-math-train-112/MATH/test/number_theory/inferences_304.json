        "inference": "The prime factorization of $26A7114B4C0$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 43 \\cdot 47$.\n\nThe least common multiple of the first $25$ positive integers is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23$.\n\nTherefore, $A = 3$, $B = 2$, and $C = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{320}$.

        "ground_truth": "First, we observe that both $4$ and $25$ will divide into the least common multiple. Thus, $100$ will divide into the least common multiple, and so $C = 0$.\n\nAlso, we notice that $9$ and $11$ divide into the least common multiple. Thus, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$: $$2 + 6 + A + 7 + 1 + 1 + 4 + B + 4 = 25 + A + B = 27,36$$and the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by $11$ (the divisibility rule for $11$): $$2 - 6 + A - 7 + 1 - 1 + 4 - B + 4 = -3 + A - B = 0, -11.$$It follows that $A+B = 2,11$ and $A - B = 3, -8$. Summing the two equations yields that $2A \\in \\{-6,3,5,14\\}$, of which only $2A = 14 \\Longrightarrow A = 7$ works. It follows that $B = 4$, and the answer is $\\boxed{740}$."
