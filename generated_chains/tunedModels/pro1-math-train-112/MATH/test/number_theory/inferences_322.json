        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be \\(n\\), \\(n+1\\), and \\(n+2\\). Then, we have:\n\n$$n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3=k^3$$\n\nfor some integer \\(k\\). Expanding the cubes, we get:\n\n$$n^3+n^3+3n^2+3n+1+n^3+6n^2+12n+8+n^3+9n^2+27n+27=k^3$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$4n^3+21n^2+48n+36=k^3$$\n\nSince \\(k\\) is an integer, \\(4n^3+21n^2+48n+36\\) must be a perfect cube. The smallest positive perfect cube is \\(1^3=1\\), so we have:\n\n$$4n^3+21n^2+48n+36=1$$\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$4n^3+21n^2+48n+35=0$$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$$(n+1)(4n^2+17n+35)=0$$\n\nSince \\(n\\) is an integer, we have \\(n+1=0\\) or \\(4n^2+17n+35=0\\). Solving the first equation, we get \\(n=-1\\), which is not a positive integer. Solving the second equation using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$n=\\frac{-17\\pm\\sqrt{17^2-4(4)(35)}}{2(4)}=\\frac{-17\\pm\\sqrt{289-560}}{8}=\\frac{-17\\pm\\sqrt{-271}}{8}$$\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there is no positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n^3+(n+1)^3+(n+2)^3\\) is a perfect cube.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{None}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of three consecutive integers takes the form $(k-1)+(k)+(k+1)=3k$ and hence is a multiple of 3.  Conversely, if a number $n$ is a multiple of 3, then $n/3-1$, $n/3$, and $n/3+1$ are three consecutive integers that sum to give $n$.  Therefore, a number is a sum of three consecutive integers if and only if it is a multiple of 3.  The smallest positive perfect cube that is a multiple of 3 is $3^3=\\boxed{27}$."
