        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the least positive four-digit solution $r$ of the congruence $r^2 + 4r + 4 \\equiv r^2 + 2r + 1 \\pmod{55} $.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe have $r^2 + 4r + 4 \\equiv r^2 + 2r + 1 \\pmod{55} \\iff 2r + 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{55} \\iff 2r \\equiv 52 \\pmod{55} \\iff r \\equiv 26 \\pmod{55}$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive four-digit solution is $r = 26 + 55 \\cdot 79 = \\boxed{4306}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4306}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Add $-r^2-2r-4$ to both sides of the given congruence to obtain $2r\\equiv -3\\pmod{55}$. We can multiply both sides by $28$ to get $56r \\equiv -3\\cdot 28\\pmod{55}$. Subtracting $55r$ from the left-hand side and adding $2\\cdot 55=110$ to the right-hand side gives $r\\equiv 26\\pmod{55}$. Thus $r=26+55k$ for some integer $k$. Solving $26+55k\\geq 1000$, we find that $k=18$ is the smallest value of $k$ for which $r$ has four digits. Thus the minimum four-digit value of $r$ is $26+55(18)=\\boxed{1016}$."
