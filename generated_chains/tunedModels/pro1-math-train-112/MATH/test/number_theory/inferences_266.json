        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe units digit of a three-digit number is 6. What is the probability that the number is divisible by 6? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The number is divisible by 6 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The units digit is 6, so the sum of the other two digits must be divisible by 3. There are 10 possible digits for the tens digit (0-9), and 10 possible digits for the hundreds digit (0-9). For the sum of the other two digits to be divisible by 3, the tens digit must be 0, 3, 6, or 9. There are 4 possible tens digits, and 10 possible hundreds digits. So there are 4 * 10 = 40 possible two-digit numbers that can be combined with the units digit 6 to form a three-digit number divisible by 6. There are 100 possible three-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 0-9. So the probability that a three-digit number with units digit 6 is divisible by 6 is 40/100 = 2/5.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2/5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The common difference of the arithmetic sequence 106, 116, 126, ..., 996 is relatively prime to 3.  Therefore, given any three consecutive terms, exactly one of them is divisible by 3.  Since there are $1+(996-106)/10=90$ terms in the sequence, $90/3=30$ of them are divisible by 3.  Since every term is even, a term is divisible by 3 if and only if it is divisible by 6.  Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected term in the sequence is a multiple of 6 is $30/90=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
