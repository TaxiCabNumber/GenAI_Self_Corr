        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $30x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{47}$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can rewrite the congruence as $30x - 42 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}$.  Factoring out a $6$ from the left-hand side, we get $6(5x - 7) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $6$ and $47$ are relatively prime, we have $5x - 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}$.  Adding $7$ to both sides, we get $5x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{47}$.  Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get $50x \\equiv 70 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $50 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{47}$, we have $3x \\equiv 70 \\pmod{47}$.  Multiplying both sides by $16$, we get $48x \\equiv 1120 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $48 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$, we have $x \\equiv 1120 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $1120 \\equiv 23 \\pmod{47}$, we have $x \\equiv 23 \\pmod{47}$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{23}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{23}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that 6 divides both $30x$ and $42$, and since 6 is relatively prime to 47, we can write $5x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{47}$. Note that $5 \\cdot 19 = 95 = 2(47) + 1$, so 19 is the modular inverse of 5, modulo 47. We multiply both sides of the given congruence by 19 to obtain $95x \\equiv 19(7) \\pmod{47}\\implies x \\equiv \\boxed{39} \\pmod{47}$."
