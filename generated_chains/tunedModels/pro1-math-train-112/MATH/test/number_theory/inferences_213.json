At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?",
        "inference": "Let the tens digit be x and the units digit be y. Then the number is 10x + y.\n\nAccording to the given condition,\n10x + y = 2(x + y)\n\u21d2 10x + y = 2x + 2y\n\u21d2 8x = y\n\u21d2 x = y/8\n\nSince x is a digit, it can take values from 0 to 9. So, y/8 should be an integer between 0 and 9. The only possible value of y/8 is 1, which gives y = 8 and x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the number is 10x + y = 10(1) + 8 = 18.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the tens digit of the two-digit integer be $a$ and let its units digit be $b$.  The equation \\[\n10a+b=2(a+b)\n\\] is given.  Distributing on the right-hand side and subtracting $2a+b$ from both sides gives $8a=b$.  Since $8a>9$ for any digit $a>1$, we have $a=1$, $b=8$, and $10a+b=\\boxed{18}$."
