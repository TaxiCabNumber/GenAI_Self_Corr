At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors $n$ has, $c$ is a positive integer, and the greatest common factor of the three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$. What is $a+b+c$?",
        "inference": "The number of positive divisors of $n$ is $x$. The sum of the exponents of the prime factors of $n$ is $ax+b$. The product of the prime factors of $n$ is $n$. Therefore, $n^{ax+b}=n^{(ax+b)/c}$. So, $ax+b=c$. Since the greatest common factor of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $1$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are relatively prime. Therefore, $a+b+c$ is the sum of three relatively prime positive integers. The only way this sum can be $1$ is if $a=b=c=1$. Therefore, $a+b+c=\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that by pairing up divisors of $n$, we can show that the product of the positive integer factors of $n$ is $n^\\frac{x}{2}$. We divide this formula by $n$ to get the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$, and we obtain $\\frac{n^\\frac{x}{2}}{n} = n^{\\frac{x}{2}-1} = n^\\frac{x-2}{2}$. Therefore, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = 2$, so $a+b+c = \\boxed{1}$."
