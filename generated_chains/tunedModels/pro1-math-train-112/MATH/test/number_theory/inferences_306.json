        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many more digits does the base-10 number 87 have when expressed in base 2 than when expressed in base 3?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nIn base 2, 87 = 1010111. This has 7 digits.\n\nIn base 3, 87 = 10000. This has 5 digits.\n\nTherefore, the number has 7 - 5 = 2 more digits in base 2 than in base 3.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.  The difference between 7 digits and 5 digits is $\\boxed{2}$ digits."
