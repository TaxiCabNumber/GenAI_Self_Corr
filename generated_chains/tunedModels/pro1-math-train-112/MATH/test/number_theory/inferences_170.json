At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the integers $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\\dots,$ $16$ is written on a separate slip of paper and these slips are placed in a pile. Jillian will randomly draw slips from the pile without replacement and will continue drawing until two of the numbers she has drawn from the pile have a product that is a perfect square. What is the maximum number of slips that Jillian can draw without obtaining a product that is a perfect square?",

        "ground_truth": "Recall that an integer is called square-free if the only exponent which appears in the prime factorization of the integer is $1.$ For example, $2\\cdot3\\cdot11$ is square-free, but $7^3\\cdot13$ and $2^2\\cdot3$ are not. We define the \"square-free part\" of a positive integer which is not a perfect square to be largest square-free factor of the integer.
