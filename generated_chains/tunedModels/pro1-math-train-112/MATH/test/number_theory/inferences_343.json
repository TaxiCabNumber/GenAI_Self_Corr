        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nExpress $0.\\overline{54}$ as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{54}$. Then $100x = 54.\\overline{54}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $99x = 54$, so $x = \\frac{54}{99} = \\frac{6}{11}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{11}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x=0.\\overline{54}$. Then $100x=54.\\overline{54}$, and $100x-x=54.\\overline{54}-54 \\implies 99x = 54$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{54}=\\frac{54}{99}$. This simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{11}}$, when both the numerator and the denominator are divided by $9$."
