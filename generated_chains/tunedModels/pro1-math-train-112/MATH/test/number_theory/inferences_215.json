        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers $t$ will make the expression $\\frac{19}{t}+\\frac{5}{t}$ have an integral value?",
        "inference": "The expression $\\frac{19}{t}+\\frac{5}{t}$ has an integral value if and only if $t$ is a divisor of $19+5=24$. The divisors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ positive integers $t$ that will make the expression $\\frac{19}{t}+\\frac{5}{t}$ have an integral value.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can simplify $\\frac{19}{t}+\\frac{5}{t}$ as $\\frac{19+5}{t}$, or $\\frac{24}{t}$. So, in order for this expression to have an integral value, 24 must be divisible by $t$. In other words, $t$ must be a factor of 24. Therefore, to find the number of positive integers $t$ that will make the expression have an integral value, we just need to find the number of factors of 24. We know that if $ n ={p_{1}}^{e_{1}}\\cdot{p_{2}}^{e_{2}}\\cdot{p_{3}}^{e_{3}}\\cdots{p_{k}}^{e_{k}} $, where $p_1, p_2...p_k$ are prime numbers, then the number of factors of $n$ is equal to $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$. We have that the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^1$, so using the formula above, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{8}$ factors."
