        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. If the sum is less than 220, what is the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be \\(x\\), \\(x+1\\), and \\(x+2\\).\n\nThe sum of the three integers is \\(x+(x+1)+(x+2)=3x+3\\).\n\nSince the sum is a three-digit palindrome, it must be between 100 and 999.\n\nTherefore, we have \\(100\\le3x+3\\le999\\).\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get \\(33\\le x\\le332\\).\n\nSince \\(x\\) is an integer, the greatest possible value for \\(x\\) is \\(332\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{332}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the set $\\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\\boxed{58}$."
