        "inference": "The largest three-digit number is $999$. The product of the digits of $999$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 729$. Since $729$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $998$. The product of the digits of $998$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 648$. Since $648$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $997$. The product of the digits of $997$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 7 = 567$. Since $567$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $996$. The product of the digits of $996$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 6 = 486$. Since $486$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $995$. The product of the digits of $995$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 405$. Since $405$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $994$. The product of the digits of $994$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 4 = 324$. Since $324$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $993$. The product of the digits of $993$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 3 = 243$. Since $243$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $992$. The product of the digits of $992$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 2 = 162$. Since $162$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $991$. The product of the digits of $991$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 1 = 81$. Since $81$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $990$. The product of the digits of $990$ is $9 \\times 9 \\times 0 = 0$. Since $0$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $989$. The product of the digits of $989$ is $9 \\times 8 \\times 9 = 648$. Since $648$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $988$. The product of the digits of $988$ is $9 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$. Since $512$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $987$. The product of the digits of $987$ is $9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 504$. Since $504$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $986$. The product of the digits of $986$ is $9 \\times 8 \\times 6 = 432$. Since $432$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $985$. The product of the digits of $985$ is $9 \\times 8 \\times 5 = 360$. Since $360$ is not equal to $12$, we need to find a smaller three-digit number.\n\nThe next largest three-digit number is $984$. The product of the digits of $984$ is $",
        "ground_truth": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$."
