At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest whole number $b$ such that 47 can be expressed in base $b$ using only two digits?",
        "inference": "The largest two-digit number in base $b$ is $b^2-1$.  Since $47<b^2-1$, we have $b^2>48$.  The smallest integer $b$ such that $b^2>48$ is $b=7$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For 47 to be expressed in two digits in base $b$, $47 < 100_b = 1 \\cdot b^2$.  So $\\! \\sqrt{47} < b$, which means the smallest whole number $b$ can be is $\\boxed{7}$.  We can check to be sure: $47 = 65_7 = 115_6$."
