I hope it is correct.'\nA group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip. If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?",
        "inference": "Let $N$ be the number of students.\n\nIf the teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. So, $N = 8k + 5$ for some integer $k$.\n\nIf the teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. So, $N = 6m + 3$ for some integer $m$.\n\nSince $N$ is the same in both cases, we have $8k + 5 = 6m + 3$.\n\nSolving for $k$, we get $k = 3m - 1$.\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get $N = 8(3m - 1) + 5 = 24m - 3$.\n\nSince $N < 50$, we have $24m - 3 < 50$.\n\nSolving for $m$, we get $m < \\frac{53}{24}$.\n\nSince $m$ is an integer, the largest possible value of $m$ is $2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $N$ is $N = 24(2) - 3 = \\boxed{45}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\\boxed{66}$."
