        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$ is written as a decimal, how many digits are to the right of the decimal point?",

        "ground_truth": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This implies that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ digits to the right of the decimal point in $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$."
