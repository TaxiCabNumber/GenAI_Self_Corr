At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that the units digit of $a$ is $2$, the units digit of $b$ is $4$, and the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $6$.\n\nWhat is the smallest possible value of the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$?",

Therefore, the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is even.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $6$, so $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of $6$. The smallest possible value of the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is the smallest multiple of $6$ that is even. The smallest multiple of $6$ that is even is $12$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}.

Therefore, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{6},$$so in order to minimize $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we should make $ab$ as small as possible. But we can't take $a=12$ and $b=24$, because then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be $12$, not $6$. The next best choice is either $a=12,b=54$ or $a=42,b=24$. Either of these pairs yields $\\gcd(a,b)=6$ as desired, but the first choice, $a=12$ and $b=54$, yields a smaller product. Hence this is the optimal choice, and the smallest possible value for $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[12,54] = \\frac{12\\cdot 54}{6} = 2\\cdot 54 = \\boxed{108}.$$"
