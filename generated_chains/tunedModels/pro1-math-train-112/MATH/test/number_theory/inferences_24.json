        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have seven bags of gold coins. Each bag has the same number of gold coins. One day, you find a bag of 53 coins. You decide to redistribute the number of coins you have so that all eight bags you hold have the same number of coins. You successfully manage to redistribute all the coins, and you also note that you have more than 200 coins. What is the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of coins in each of the original seven bags.\n\nThe total number of coins before finding the bag of 53 coins is 7x.\n\nAfter finding the bag of 53 coins, the total number of coins is 7x + 53.\n\nSince all eight bags now have the same number of coins, the total number of coins is divisible by 8.\n\nThe smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is the smallest multiple of 8 that is greater than 200.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 8 that is greater than 200 is 208.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is 208.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{208}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $b$ gold coins in each of the original 7 bags, then $7b+53$ is divisible by 8. In other words, $7b + 53 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$. Since $53 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ and $7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{8}$, we have that $-b \\equiv -5 \\pmod{8}$. Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get that $b \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. Now, we want $7b + 53 > 200$, so as a result, $b > \\frac{200-53}{7} \\implies b > 21$. Therefore, we want an integer greater than 21 which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. The least such integer is 29, so you had $29 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{203}$ coins before finding the bag of 53 coins."
