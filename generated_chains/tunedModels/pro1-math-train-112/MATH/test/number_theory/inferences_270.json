Each proper divisor will be composed of three or fewer of these factors. Those divisors that do not contain the factor 11 will be either the proper divisors of 18 or 18 itself, contributing 21 and 18, respectively, to the sum. Those divisors that do contain the factor 11 will again by the proper divisors of 18, only multiplied by 11. The sum of these divisors, therefore, is $11\\cdot 21=231$. Since these are all possible divisors, the sum of the proper divisors of 198 is $21+18+231=\\boxed{270}$."
