At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many perfect square factors does the number 46,656 have?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of 46,656 is 2^5 * 3^2 * 7^2.\n\nThe number of perfect square factors is the number of times each prime factor appears in the prime factorization.\n\nIn this case, 2 appears 5 times, 3 appears 2 times, and 7 appears 2 times.\n\nTherefore, the number of perfect square factors is 5 + 2 + 2 = 9.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$46656=2^6\\cdot3^6$. So, $x$ is a factor of $46656$ if and only if there exist integers $a$ and $b$ such that $0\\le a\\le6$, $0\\le b\\le6$, and $x=2^a3^b$. Such an $x$ is a perfect square if and only if $a$ and $b$ are both even, which is true if and only if $a$ and $b$ are each 0, 2, 4, or 6. There are $4$ possible values of $a$, and $4$ possible values of $b$, so there are $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ possible values of $x$."
