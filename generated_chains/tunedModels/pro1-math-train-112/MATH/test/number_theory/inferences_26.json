        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Chinese emperor orders a regiment of soldiers in his palace to divide into groups of $4$. They do so successfully. He then orders them to divide into groups of $3$, upon which $2$ of them are left without a group. He then orders them to divide into groups of $11$, upon which $5$ are left without a group. If the emperor estimates there are about two hundred soldiers in the regiment, what is the most likely number of soldiers in the regiment?",
        "inference": "Let the number of soldiers be $x$.\n\nWhen they divide into groups of $4$, there are no soldiers left without a group. So, $x$ is divisible by $4$.\n\nWhen they divide into groups of $3$, $2$ are left without a group. So, $x$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $3$.\n\nWhen they divide into groups of $11$, $5$ are left without a group. So, $x$ leaves a remainder of $5$ when divided by $11$.\n\nThe smallest number that is divisible by $4$, leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $3$, and leaves a remainder of $5$ when divided by $11$ is $22$.\n\nSince the emperor estimates there are about two hundred soldiers in the regiment, the most likely number of soldiers in the regiment is $220$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{220}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of soldiers. According to the problem statement, it follows that \\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{align*}By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is an unique residue that $n$ can leave, modulo $33$; since $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, it follows that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{33}$. Also, we know that $n$ is divisible by $4$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again, it follows that $n \\equiv 104 \\pmod{132}$. Writing out the first few positive values of $n$, we obtain that $n = 104, 236, 368$, and so forth. The closest value of $n$ is $\\boxed{236}$."
