        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe base-10 integers 36, 64, and 81 can be converted into other bases so that their values are represented by the same digits $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$, where $\\triangle$ and $\\Box$ are two distinct digits from 0-9. What is the value of $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $\\triangle$ and $\\Box$ be the two digits. Then, we have:\n\n$$36 = \\triangle\\Box\\Box_{base}$$\n\n$$64 = \\triangle\\Box\\Box_{base}$$\n\n$$81 = \\triangle\\Box\\Box_{base}$$\n\nSince $\\triangle$ and $\\Box$ are distinct digits from 0-9, the only possible values for $\\triangle$ and $\\Box$ are $\\triangle = 1$ and $\\Box = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\triangle\\Box\\Box = 122$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{122}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "36, 64, and 81 are all perfect squares. That means they can all be written as $1\\cdot a^2+0\\cdot a^1+0\\cdot a^0=100_a$, where $a$ is the square root of each number. So, all three numbers can be represented by the digits $\\boxed{100}$ when converted to other bases. To see that no other digits work, note that only the bases 4, 5, and 6 use three digits to represent the number 36. (This follows from $b^2\\leq 36<b^3$, which expresses the condition that 36 has 3 digits in base $b$). The representations are $100_6$, $121_5$ and $210_4$, only one of which fits the form $\\triangle\\Box\\Box$."
