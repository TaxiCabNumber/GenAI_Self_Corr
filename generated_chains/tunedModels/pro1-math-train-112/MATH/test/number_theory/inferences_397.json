        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLinda, Sherry, June, and Connie walked around their neighborhoods selling girl scout cookies. Linda earned $\\$27.47$, Sherry earned $\\$35.23$, June earned $\\$37.37$, and Connie earned $\\$26.52$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. How much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?",
        "inference": "1. Add the amount of money each girl earned: $27.47 + $35.23 + $37.37 + $26.52 = $126.59.\n2. Convert the total amount of money to cents: $126.59 x 100 = 12659 cents.\n3. Determine the largest bills that can be made from the total amount of cents:\n   - $100 bills: 12659 cents \u00f7 10000 cents = 1 bill\n   - $20 bills: (12659 cents - 10000 cents) \u00f7 2000 cents = 1 bill\n   - $10 bills: (12659 cents - 10000 cents - 2000 cents) \u00f7 1000 cents = 6 bills\n   - $5 bills: (12659 cents - 10000 cents - 2000 cents - 6000 cents) \u00f7 500 cents = 1 bill\n   - $1 bills: (12659 cents - 10000 cents - 2000 cents - 6000 cents - 500 cents) \u00f7 100 cents = 1 bill\n4. Calculate the total value of the bills: (1 x $100) + (1 x $20) + (6 x $10) + (1 x $5) + (1 x $1) = $186.\n5. Subtract the total value of the bills from the total amount of cents to find the amount of cents left over: 12659 cents - 18600 cents = 99 cents.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{99}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2747 &\\equiv 47 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3523 &\\equiv 23 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3737 &\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n2652 &\\equiv 52 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$47+23+37+52 \\equiv 159 \\equiv 59 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{59}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible."
