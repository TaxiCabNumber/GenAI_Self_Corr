I hope it is correct.'\nWhen working modulo $m$, the notation $a^{-1}$ is used to denote the residue $b$ for which $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, if any exists.

Since $4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}$, we have that $a^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{20}$ if and only if $a \\equiv \\pm 2 \\pmod{20}$. There are $10$ integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{20}$, and $10$ integers $a$ satisfying $0 \\le a < 100$ such that $a \\equiv -2 \\pmod{20}$.
