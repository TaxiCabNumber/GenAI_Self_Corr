        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe have $p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 = (n - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 40.5$.\n\nSince $40.5$ is not an integer, $p(n)$ is prime for all positive integers $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $p(2) = 2^2 - 2 + 41 = 41$ and $p(3) = 3^2 - 3 + 41 = 43$.\n\nSince $41$ and $43$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 4$.\n\nTherefore, $p(4) = 4^2 - 4 + 41 = 57$ and $p(5) = 5^2 - 5 + 41 = 61$.\n\nSince $57$ and $61$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 6$.\n\nTherefore, $p(6) = 6^2 - 6 + 41 = 73$ and $p(7) = 7^2 - 7 + 41 = 83$.\n\nSince $73$ and $83$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 8$.\n\nTherefore, $p(8) = 8^2 - 8 + 41 = 97$ and $p(9) = 9^2 - 9 + 41 = 113$.\n\nSince $97$ and $113$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 10$.\n\nTherefore, $p(10) = 10^2 - 10 + 41 = 121$ and $p(11) = 11^2 - 11 + 41 = 133$.\n\nSince $121$ and $133$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 12$.\n\nTherefore, $p(12) = 12^2 - 12 + 41 = 149$ and $p(13) = 13^2 - 13 + 41 = 163$.\n\nSince $149$ and $163$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 14$.\n\nTherefore, $p(14) = 14^2 - 14 + 41 = 179$ and $p(15) = 15^2 - 15 + 41 = 193$.\n\nSince $179$ and $193$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 16$.\n\nTherefore, $p(16) = 16^2 - 16 + 41 = 217$ and $p(17) = 17^2 - 17 + 41 = 241$.\n\nSince $217$ and $241$ are both prime numbers, they do not share a common factor greater than $1$.\n\nThe next smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n - \\frac{1}{2}$ is an integer is $n = 18$.\n\nTherefore, $p(1",
