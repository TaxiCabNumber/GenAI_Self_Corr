At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of apples that Sophia has is a multiple of $6$. When she sells one apple, the number of apples is a multiple of $n$. If $n$ is a positive integer less than $10$, how many possible values are there for $n$?",
        "inference": "Since the number of apples is a multiple of $6$, it can be written as $6k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWhen Sophia sells one apple, the number of apples becomes $6k-1$.\n\nFor $6k-1$ to be a multiple of $n$, it must be divisible by $n$.\n\nThe only positive integers less than $10$ that divide $6k-1$ are $1$, $2$, and $3$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ possible values for $n$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the number of apples that Sophia originally had. Clearly $a=6b$ for some positive integer $b$. Additionally, $a-1\\equiv 0\\pmod n\\implies 6b\\equiv 1\\pmod n$. This is solvable for $b$ if and only if $6$ is invertible modulo $n$. In other words, $\\gcd(6,n)=1$. The only such $n$ less than $10$ are $1,5,7$, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ possibilities for $n$."
