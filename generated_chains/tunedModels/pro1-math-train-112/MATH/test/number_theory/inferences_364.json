At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book with 50 pages numbered 1 through 50 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 50 to 1. For how many pages do both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit?",
        "inference": "The ones digit of the original page number is the same as the ones digit of the new page number for pages 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For any given page, the sum of the original page number and the new page number is 51, an odd number. Therefore, no page is such that both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit and the answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
