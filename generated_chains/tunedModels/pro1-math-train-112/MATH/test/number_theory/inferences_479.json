At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit numbers are divisible by 13?",

        "ground_truth": "The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is $13\\times 8=104$, so there are seven two-digit multiples of 13. The greatest three-digit number divisible by 13 is $13\\times 76=988$. Therefore, there are $76-7=\\boxed{69}$ three-digit numbers divisible by 13.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the integer part of $\\frac{999}{13}$ is 76, there are 76 multiples of 13 less than or equal to 999. Because the integer part of $\\frac{99}{13}$ is 7, there are 7 multiples of 13 less than or equal to 99. That means there are $76-7=\\boxed{69}$ multiples of 13 between 100 and 999."
