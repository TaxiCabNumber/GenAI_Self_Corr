        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of the product of all of the odd integers between 0 and 12?",
        "inference": "The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.\n\nThe units digit of the product of these numbers is the same as the units digit of the product of their units digits, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1.\n\nThe units digit of the product of these numbers is 1, because the product of any number of odd numbers is odd.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. Thus, $N=1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9\\times11= 5(1\\times3\\times7\\times9\\times11)$. The product of odd integers is odd, and the units digit of 5 times any odd number is $5$. Therefore,  the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
