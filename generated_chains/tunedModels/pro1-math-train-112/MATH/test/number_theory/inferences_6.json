I hope it is correct.'\nA bus comes by Jerry's bus stop every 20 minutes starting at exactly 5:13 a.m. If Jerry shows up at exactly 8:35 a.m., how many minutes will he have to wait for the next bus?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of 20-minute intervals between 5:13 a.m. and 8:35 a.m.\n(8:35 a.m. - 5:13 a.m.) / 20 minutes = 19 intervals\n\n2. Multiply the number of intervals by the length of each interval to find the total number of minutes between 5:13 a.m. and 8:35 a.m.\n19 intervals * 20 minutes/interval = 380 minutes\n\n3. Subtract the total number of minutes between 5:13 a.m. and 8:35 a.m. from 60 minutes (the length of one hour) to find the number of minutes Jerry will have to wait for the next bus.\n60 minutes - 380 minutes = -320 minutes\n\n4. Since Jerry will have to wait for the next bus that comes after 8:35 a.m., add 60 minutes to the negative number of minutes to find the number of minutes he will have to wait.\n-320 minutes + 60 minutes = -260 minutes\n\n5. Convert the negative number of minutes to a positive number of minutes by taking the absolute value.\n|-260 minutes| = 260 minutes\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{260}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 20 minutes evenly divides 60 minutes (which is an hour), the bus stops every 13 minutes, $13 + 20 = 33$ minutes, and $33 + 20 = 53$ minutes past the hour.  So after 8:35 AM, the next time that the bus stops is 8:53 AM, so Jerry must wait $53 - 35 = \\boxed{18}$ minutes."
