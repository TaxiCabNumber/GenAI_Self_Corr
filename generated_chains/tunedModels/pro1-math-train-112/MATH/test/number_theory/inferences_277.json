At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The prime factorization of 450 is 2 * 3^2 * 5^2.\n\nTo make the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones, we need to multiply 450 by the smallest number of 2s, 3s, and 5s that will make all the digits zeroes and ones.\n\nWe need 1 2 to make the digit in the tens place a 0.\nWe need 2 3s to make the digit in the hundreds place a 0.\nWe need 2 5s to make the digit in the thousands place a 0.\n\nSo, we need to multiply 450 by 2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 900.\n\n900 is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{900}.

        "ground_truth": "If a number is divisible by 450, then it must be divisible by all divisors of 450, including 9 and 50.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since a positive number must have at least one digit which is not 0, the number we're looking for is forced to have at least 9 ones among its digits.\n\nThe number we're looking for must also be divisible by 50, which means that it ends in 50 or 00. Since the digit 5 is not allowed, our number must end in 00, which means the smallest candidate is  $\\boxed{11,\\! 111,\\! 111,\\! 100}$. In fact, because 9 and 50 $\\emph{do}$ divide this number, and because 450 is the least common multiple of 9 and 50, we know that 450 does divide 11,111,111,100; so that number is the correct answer."
