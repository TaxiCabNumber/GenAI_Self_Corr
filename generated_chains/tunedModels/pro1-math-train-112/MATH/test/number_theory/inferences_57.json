By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible positive integer solutions to this equation are 1, 2, 7, and 14. 1 and 2 are invalid bases since the digit 6 is used, so we first try $b=7$. It turns out that $b=7$ is a solution to this cubic. If we divide by $b-7$, we get the quadratic $3b^2 + 6b + 2$, which has no integral solutions.
