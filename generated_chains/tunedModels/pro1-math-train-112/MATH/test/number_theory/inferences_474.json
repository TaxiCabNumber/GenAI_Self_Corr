        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWendy noticed when she stacked her quarters in piles of 5 she had 3 left over and when she stacked them in piles of 7 she had 5 left over. If she has less than ten dollars worth of quarters, how many quarters does she have?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of quarters Wendy has.\n\nSince she has 3 left over when she stacks them in piles of 5, x = 5k + 3 for some integer k.\n\nSince she has 5 left over when she stacks them in piles of 7, x = 7m + 5 for some integer m.\n\nEquating the two expressions for x, we get 5k + 3 = 7m + 5.\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides, we get 5k = 7m + 2.\n\nSince 5k is even, 7m + 2 must also be even.\n\nThe only even number that can be written in the form 7m + 2 is 7m + 2 = 14.\n\nTherefore, 5k = 14, so k = 2.\n\nSubstituting k = 2 into x = 5k + 3, we get x = 5(2) + 3 = 13.\n\nTherefore, Wendy has 13 quarters.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{13}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the number of quarters. We know that \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3\\pmod 5\\\\\na\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=3+5n$. Substituting this into $(b)$ gives \\[3+5n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\\ge 6\\implies a=3+5n\\ge 33$. $33$ happens to satisfy both congruences, so it is the smallest common solution. Since she has less than $10$ dollars worth of quarters, she has less than $40$ quarters. If $b$ is a common solution, subtracting $33$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-33\\equiv -30\\equiv 0\\pmod 5\\nonumber\\\\\nb-33\\equiv -28\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, we have $b-33\\equiv 0\\pmod{5\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 33\\pmod {35}$. The first couple of positive solutions of this are $33,68$. Thus, there exists only one positive solution less than $40$, which we found earlier to be $\\boxed{33}$."
