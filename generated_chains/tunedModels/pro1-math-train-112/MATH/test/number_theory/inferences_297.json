At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen all the girls at Madeline's school line up in rows of eight, there are seven left over.\n\nIf instead they line up in rows of four, how many are left over?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of girls.\n\nSince there are seven left over when the girls line up in rows of eight, the total number of girls must be a multiple of eight plus seven.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of rows of four.\n\nTo find the number of rows of four, divide the total number of girls by four.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the number of girls left over.\n\nTo find the number of girls left over, multiply the number of rows of four by four and subtract the result from the total number of girls.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of girls is of the form $8n+7$, where $n$ is some integer (the number of rows). This expression can also be written as $4(2n+1)+3$, so when the girls line up in rows of four, they make $2n+1$ rows with $\\boxed{3}$ girls left over."
