At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDayna writes the integers $$1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12$$on a chalkboard, then she erases the integers from $1$ through $6$, as well as their multiplicative inverses $\\pmod{13}$.

The only residue from $7$ through $12$ that is not the inverse of a residue from $1$ through $6$ is $\\boxed{12}$ (which is its own inverse).\n\n(Note that $m-1$ is always its own inverse modulo $m$, so we know without doing most of the work above that Dayna could not have erased $12$. The rest of the work only goes to confirm that $12$ is the $\\textbf{only}$ residue she did not erase.)"
