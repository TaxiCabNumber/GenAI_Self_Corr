At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(-1, -2)$ and $B(3, 2)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter, which is $M(1, 0)$. The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to either endpoint of the diameter, which is $r = \\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. The area of the circle is $A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\pi (8) = \\boxed{8\\pi}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we use the distance formula to find the length of the diameter.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-1-3)^2+(-2-2)^2} &= \\sqrt{16 + 16} \\\\\n&= 4\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{align*}Since the diameter has a length of $4\\sqrt{2}$, the radius must have length $2\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the answer is $(2\\sqrt{2})^2\\pi = \\boxed{8\\pi}$."
