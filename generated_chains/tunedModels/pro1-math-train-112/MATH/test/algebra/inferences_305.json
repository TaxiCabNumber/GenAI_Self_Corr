At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking by a classroom, Linda sees two perfect squares written on a blackboard.  She notices that their difference is her favorite number, 99.  She also notices that there are exactly two other perfect squares between them.  What is the sum of the two perfect squares on the blackboard?",
        "inference": "Let the two perfect squares be $x^2$ and $(x+2)^2$. Then, we have:\n\n$$(x+2)^2-x^2=99$$\n\n$$x^2+4x+4-x^2=99$$\n\n$$4x=95$$\n\n$$x=23.75$$\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the two perfect squares are $23^2=529$ and $25^2=625$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$529+625=1154$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We name those two perfect squares on the blackboard $a^2$ and $b^2$. We are given that $a^2-b^2=99$. Factoring, we get $(a-b)(a+b)=99$.\nSince the two perfect squares have two other perfect squares between them, we know that $a-b=3$. Therefore, $a+b=33$. Adding the two equations together, we get $2a=36$. Therefore, $a=18$ and $b=15$. Thus, the sum of the two perfect squares is $a^2+b^2=324+225=\\boxed{549}$."
