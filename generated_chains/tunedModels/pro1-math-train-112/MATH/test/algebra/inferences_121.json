        "inference": "The distance between the centers of the circles is $d = \\sqrt{(-3-0)^2+(2-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. Since the circles are internally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii, so $3\\sqrt{2} = 2.83 + 7.07 = 9.9$. Thus, $D = -2(0) = 0$, $E = -2(-1) = 2$, and $F = 9.9^2/2 = 49.5$. Therefore, $D + E + F = 0 + 2 + 49.5 = \\boxed{51.5}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{51.5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the larger circle is given by the distance formula to be $\\sqrt{(6-(-1))^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 1} = 5\\sqrt{2}$. The distance between the centers of the two circles is given by the distance formula to be $\\sqrt{(-3-0)^2 + (2-(-1))^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the radius of the smaller circle is equal to $5\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, and the square of the radius is $8$. The equation of the smaller circle is given by $$(x+3)^2+(y-2)^2 = 8 \\Longrightarrow x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 4y + 5 = 0.$$ So $D+E+F=6 - 4 + 5 = \\boxed{7}$."
