        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of calories in Raymond's usual snack.\n\nTotal calories = Number of crackers \u00d7 Calories per cracker\nTotal calories = 10 \u00d7 12\nTotal calories = 120\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of calories in each cookie.\n\nCalories per cookie = 20\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the number of cookies needed to consume the same number of calories.\n\nNumber of cookies = Total calories \u00f7 Calories per cookie\nNumber of cookies = 120 \u00f7 20\nNumber of cookies = 6\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies."
