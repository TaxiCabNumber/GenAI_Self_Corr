At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix construction workers that work at the same rate can build a house in 1.5 days.  How long does it take 15 construction workers, working at the same rate, to finish building a house?  Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the total amount of work required to build the house.\nSince 6 workers can build the house in 1.5 days, the total amount of work is 6 * 1.5 = 9 worker-days.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of worker-days available with 15 workers.\nWith 15 workers, the number of worker-days available is 15 * x, where x is the number of days it takes to build the house.\n\n**Step 3:** Set the total amount of work equal to the number of worker-days available.\n9 = 15 * x\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for x.\nx = 9 / 15 = 3 / 5\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{5}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number of workers is inversely proportional to the amount of time it takes to build a house.  Thus $$\\text{number of workers} \\times \\text{time} = \\text{constant}.$$Using this, we have that $6 \\cdot 1.5 = 15 \\cdot t \\Rightarrow t = .6$.  As a fraction in lowest terms this is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$."
