        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by $A=\\pi r^2$. The difference in the areas of the two circles is given by $A_R-A_r=\\pi R^2-\\pi r^2=\\pi(R^2-r^2)$. We want this difference to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$, so we have $\\pi(R^2-r^2)\\le5\\pi$. Dividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get $R^2-r^2\\le5$. Since $r+R=10$, we have $R=10-r$. Substituting this into the inequality, we get $(10-r)^2-r^2\\le5$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $100-20r+r^2-r^2\\le5$. Combining like terms, we get $100-20r\\le5$. Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get $-20r\\le-95$. Dividing both sides by -20, we get $r\\ge4.75$. Since $r$ must be an integer, the maximum value of $r$ is $r=\\boxed{5}$. The maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $R-r=(10-5)=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want $\\pi R^{2}-\\pi r^{2}\\leq 5\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\\leq 5$. Substituting 10 for $R+r$ gives $10(R-r)\\leq 5 \\implies R-r \\leq 1/2$. So the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
