        "ground_truth": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. The coordinates of a midpoint are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, so we know that $\\frac{-2+x}{2} = 1$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = -6$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ gives $x = 4$ and $y = -13$. We take the sum of $x$ and $y$ for an answer of $\\boxed{-9}$."
