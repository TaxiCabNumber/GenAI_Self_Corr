        "inference": "The line $y = -2x + 18$ has a slope of $-2$ and a $y$-intercept of $18$. This means that for every $2$ units the line moves to the right, it moves down $1$ unit.\n\nTo find the number of lattice points the line passes through, we need to find the number of integer values of $x$ for which $y$ is also an integer.\n\nLet's start by finding the $x$-intercept of the line. This is the point where the line crosses the $x$-axis, which is when $y = 0$. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation of the line, we get:\n\n$$0 = -2x + 18$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 9$$\n\nSo the line crosses the $x$-axis at the point $(9, 0)$.\n\nNow let's find the $y$-intercept of the line. This is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis, which is when $x = 0$. Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation of the line, we get:\n\n$$y = -2(0) + 18 = 18$$\n\nSo the line crosses the $y$-axis at the point $(0, 18)$.\n\nThe line passes through the lattice points $(9, 0)$ and $(0, 18)$. To find the number of lattice points between these two points, we need to find the number of integer values of $x$ for which $y$ is also an integer.\n\nThe slope of the line is $-2$, which means that for every $2$ units the line moves to the right, it moves down $1$ unit. So for every $2$ units the line moves to the right, the $y$-coordinate decreases by $1$.\n\nStarting at the point $(9, 0)$, the line moves to the right $1$ unit to the point $(10, -2)$. The line then moves to the right $2$ units to the point $(12, -6)$. The line then moves to the right $1$ unit to the point $(13, -8)$. The line then moves to the right $2$ units to the point $(15, -12)$. The line then moves to the right $1$ unit to the point $(16, -14)$. The line then moves to the right $2$ units to the point $(18, -18)$.\n\nSo the line passes through the lattice points $(9, 0)$, $(10, -2)$, $(12, -6)$, $(13, -8)$, $(15, -12)$, $(16, -14)$, and $(18, -18)$.\n\nTherefore, the line passes through $\\boxed{7}$ lattice points.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points."
