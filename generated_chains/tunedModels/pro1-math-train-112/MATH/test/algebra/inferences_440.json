        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a certain species of ocean fish, 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding. If doctors want to study 600 fish, what is the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment?",
        "inference": "The number of cubic meters of water needed is equal to the number of fish divided by the number of fish per cubic meter.\n\nNumber of cubic meters of water = Number of fish / Number of fish per cubic meter\n\nNumber of cubic meters of water = 600 fish / 8 fish per cubic meter\n\nNumber of cubic meters of water = 75 cubic meters\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{75}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We need 8 fish per cubic meter.  We have 600 fish, so we have $600/8 = 75$ groups of 8 fish, which means we need $\\boxed{75}$ cubic meters of water."
