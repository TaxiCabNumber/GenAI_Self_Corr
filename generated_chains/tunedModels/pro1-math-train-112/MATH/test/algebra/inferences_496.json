At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$, what is the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value?",
        "inference": "The smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is the smallest integer value for $x$ such that $x-1 \\ge 0$ and $x-2 \\ne 0$. The smallest integer value for $x$ such that $x-1 \\ge 0$ is $x=1$, and the smallest integer value for $x$ such that $x-2 \\ne 0$ is $x=3$. Therefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value is $x=\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression inside the square root in the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must not be 0. So we have the two conditions $x-1\\ge0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 1$ and $x-2 \\ne 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ne 2$. We see that $x=\\boxed{1}$ is the smallest integer value that satisfies both conditions."
