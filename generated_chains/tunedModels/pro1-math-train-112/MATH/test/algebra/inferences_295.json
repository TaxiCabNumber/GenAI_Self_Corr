At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA man nearing retirement wants to invest some money in a fund that compounds annually at a rate of 6 percent, so that in five years, he will have at least $\\$100,000$.  How much money must he invest now to make that happen?  (Give your answer to the nearest dollar.)",
        "inference": "Let x be the amount of money invested now.\nIn five years, the investment will be worth x(1.06)^5.\nWe want this to be at least $100,000, so we can write the inequality:\nx(1.06)^5 \u2265 100000\nDividing both sides by (1.06)^5, we get:\nx \u2265 100000/(1.06)^5\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\nx \u2265 74353.47\nRounding up to the nearest dollar, we get:\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$74354}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the amount the man invests now, in dollars.  Then in five years, at a six percent annual interest rate, he will have $x \\cdot 1.06^5$ dollars.  Therefore, $x$ must be at least \\[\\frac{100000}{1.06^5} = \\boxed{74726},\\]to the nearest dollar."
