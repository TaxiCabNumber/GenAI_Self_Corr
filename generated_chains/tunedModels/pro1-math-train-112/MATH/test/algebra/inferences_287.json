At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn amusement park charges an entry fee of $\\$2.25$ plus $\\$1.50$ for each ride. If Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, how many rides did he pay for?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of rides Simon paid for.\n\nThe total cost of the rides is $1.50x$.\n\nThe total cost of the entry fee and the rides is $2.25 + 1.50x$.\n\nWe know that Simon spent a total of $12.75, so we can write the equation:\n\n$$2.25 + 1.50x = 12.75$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$1.50x = 10.50$$\n\n$$x = 7$$\n\nTherefore, Simon paid for $\\boxed{7}$ rides.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of rides for which Simon paid. Then $12.75=2.25+1.50x\\implies 1.50x=10.50\\implies x=\\boxed{7}$."
