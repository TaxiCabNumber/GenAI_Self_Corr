I hope it is correct.'\nAn airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?",
        "inference": "The plane climbs 100 feet during the first second, 200 feet during the second second, 300 feet during the third second, and so on.  The total number of feet climbed after n seconds is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic series 100, 200, 300, ... .  The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula\n\n$$S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n),$$\n\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term, $a_n$ is the nth term, and n is the number of terms.  In this case, $a_1 = 100$, $a_n = 100n$, and $S_n = 12000$.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get\n\n$$12000 = \\frac{n}{2}(100 + 100n).$$\n\nSolving for n, we get\n\n$$n = 120.$$\n\nTherefore, it takes the plane 120 seconds to reach an altitude of 12,000 feet above its takeoff height.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.  Thus, we want to find the smallest $t$ such that $50t(t + 1) \\ge 12000$.  Dividing both sides by 50, we get \\[t(t + 1) \\ge 240.\\] Since $15 \\cdot 16 = 240$, the smallest such $t$ is $t = \\boxed{15}$."
