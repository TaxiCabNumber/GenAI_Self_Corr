At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of the first and the third terms of an arithmetic sequence is $5$. If all terms of the sequence are positive integers, what is the fourth term?",
        "inference": "Let the first term be $a$, the common difference be $d$, and the third term be $a+2d$. Then, we have:\n\n$$a(a+2d)=5$$\n\nSince $a$ and $d$ are positive integers, the only possible solutions are $a=1$ and $d=5$, or $a=5$ and $d=1$.\n\nIf $a=1$ and $d=5$, then the fourth term is $a+3d=1+3(5)=\\boxed{16}$.\n\nIf $a=5$ and $d=1$, then the fourth term is $a+3d=5+3(1)=\\boxed{8}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ or $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only way that 5 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers is as $5 = 1 \\times 5$.  Therefore, the first and third terms are 1 and 5, in some order.  Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$."
