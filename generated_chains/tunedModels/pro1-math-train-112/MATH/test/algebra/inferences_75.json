        "inference": "Since the parabola contains the point $(-1,0)$, we have\n\n$$a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0\\Rightarrow a-b+c=0.$$Since the parabola contains the point $(0,5)$, we have$$a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5\\Rightarrow c=5.$$Since the parabola contains the point $(5,0)$, we have$$a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0\\Rightarrow 25a+5b+5=0.$$Substituting $c=5$ into this equation, we get$$25a+5b+5=0\\Rightarrow 5(5a+b+1)=0\\Rightarrow 5a+b+1=0\\Rightarrow b=-5a-1.$$Substituting $b=-5a-1$ and $c=5$ into the equation $a-b+c=0$, we get$$a-(-5a-1)+5=0\\Rightarrow 6a+6=0\\Rightarrow a=-1.$$Substituting $a=-1$ and $b=-5a-1=-5(-1)-1=4$ into the equation $c=5$, we get$$c=5.$$Therefore, $100a+10b+c=100(-1)+10(4)+5=\\boxed{-95}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-95}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the points $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points.  The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \\[a(x-2)^2+k.\\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \\[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\\] or  \\[9a+k=0.\\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \\[5=a(0-2)^2+k\\] or  \\[4a+k=5.\\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \\[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.\n\nSince $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \\[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \\[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\\boxed{-55}.\\]"
