At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo consecutive positive even numbers are each squared.  The  difference of the squares is 60.  What is the sum of the original  two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive positive even numbers be \\(x\\) and \\(x+2\\).\n\nThen, the difference of their squares is:\n\n$$(x+2)^2-x^2=x^2+4x+4-x^2=4x+4$$\n\nSince the difference of the squares is 60, we have:\n\n$$4x+4=60$$\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get:\n\n$$4x=56$$\n\n$$x=14$$\n\nTherefore, the two consecutive positive even numbers are 14 and 16.\n\nThe sum of the original two numbers is:\n\n$$14+16=\\boxed{30}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{30}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $x + 2$, where $x$ is even. We want to find $x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2$, and we are told that $(x + 2)^2 - x^2 = 60$. This last equation can be factored as a difference of squares: $(x + 2 + x)(x + 2 - x) = (2x + 2)(2) = 60$. It follows that $2x + 2 = 60/2 = \\boxed{30}$."
