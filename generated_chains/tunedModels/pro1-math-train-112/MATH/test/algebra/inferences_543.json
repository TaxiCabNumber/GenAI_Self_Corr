At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the mean of the whole numbers from 1 to 250.

        "inference": "The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. In this case, we have the numbers from 1 to 250, which is a total of 250 numbers. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 250 is:\n\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 250 = \\frac{250 \\times 251}{2} = 31,375$$\n\nTherefore, the mean of the numbers from 1 to 250 is:\n\n$$\\frac{31,375}{250} = 125.5$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{125.5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $1,\\,2,\\,3,\\ldots,250$ is an arithmetic sequence, the mean of all of the terms is equal to the mean of the first and last terms. (To see this, remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.)  So the mean is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+250) = \\boxed{125.5}$."
