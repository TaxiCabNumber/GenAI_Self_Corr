        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJosh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of miles Mike rode. Then Josh rode \\(2x\\) miles. Since Josh rode at four-fifths of Mike's rate, his rate was \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x}{t}\\) miles per hour, where \\(t\\) is the time in hours. Since Josh rode for twice the length of time as Mike, \\(t = 2s\\). So, Josh's rate was \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{x}{2s} = \\frac{2x}{5s}\\) miles per hour.\n\nSince Josh and Mike met, the distance traveled by Josh plus the distance traveled by Mike is 13 miles. So,\n\n$$2x + \\frac{2x}{5s} \\cdot 2s = 13$$\n\n$$2x + \\frac{2x}{5} = 13$$\n\n$$10x + 2x = 65$$\n\n$$12x = 65$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{65}{12}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{65}{12} = 5.42$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5.42}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$."
