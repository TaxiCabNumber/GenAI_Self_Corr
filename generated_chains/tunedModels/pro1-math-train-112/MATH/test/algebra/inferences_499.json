At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe value of $\\log_{8}{2938}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.  Find $a+b$.",

        "ground_truth": "We can have $\\log_{8}512=3$ and $\\log_{8}4096=4$.  Since $\\log_{8}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{8}512<\\log_{8}2938<\\log_{8}4096$, meaning $3<\\log_{8}2938<4$.  Thus, the desired sum is $3+4=\\boxed{7}$."
