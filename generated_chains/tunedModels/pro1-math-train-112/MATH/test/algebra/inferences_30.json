        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEight pounds of feathers and two ounces of gold together cost $\\$932$. Fourteen pounds of feathers and three ounces of gold together cost $\\$1402$. What is the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the cost of one pound of feathers and \\(y\\) be the cost of one ounce of gold.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\n\n$$8x+2y=932$$\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\n\n$$14x+3y=1402$$\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\n\n$$x=50$$\n\n$$y=100$$\n\nTherefore, the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is:\n\n$$5x+5y=5(50)+5(100)=\\boxed{750}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$750$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $f$ be the cost of a pound of feathers and $g$ the cost of an ounce of gold.  We have \\begin{align*}\n8f+2g&=932 \\\\\n14f+3g&=1402\n\\end{align*}Solving the first equation for $g$ we get $g=466-4f$.  Substituting into the second equation, we solve \\[\n14f+3(466-4f)=1402\n\\]to find $f=2$.  Substituting into $g=466-4f$ we have $g=458$.  Thus five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold costs $5(f+g)=\\boxed{2300}$ dollars."
