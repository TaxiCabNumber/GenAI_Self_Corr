At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor two real values of $n$, the equation $9x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$. What is the positive value of $n$?",

Therefore, we have $n^2-1296=0$, which gives $n=\\pm\\sqrt{1296}=\\pm36$. Since $n$ is positive, we have $n=\\boxed{36}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the quadratic expression on the LHS has exactly one root in $x$, then it must be a perfect square. Dividing 9 from both sides, we have $x^2+\\frac{n}{9}x+4=0$. In order for the LHS to be a perfect square, it must factor to either $(x+2)^2=x^2+4x+4$ or $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$ (since the leading coefficient and the constant term are already defined). Only the first case gives a positive value of $n$, which is $n=4\\cdot9=\\boxed{36}$."
