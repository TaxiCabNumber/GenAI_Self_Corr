At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMonica, who is 5 feet tall, is standing next to a pine tree that casts a shadow 34 feet long. If Monica's shadow is 2 feet long, how tall is the pine tree, in feet?",
        "inference": "Let x be the height of the pine tree. Then, the ratio of the height of the pine tree to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of Monica's height to the length of her shadow.\n\n$$\\frac{x}{34}=\\frac{5}{2}$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$2x=170$$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$$x=85$$\n\nTherefore, the height of the pine tree is 85 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{85}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Monica's shadow is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as she is tall, so the pine tree's shadow is also $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as the tree is tall. Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, the pine tree itself is $34\\div \\dfrac{2}{5}=(34)\\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{85\\text{ feet}}$ tall."
