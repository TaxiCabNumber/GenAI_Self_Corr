At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe interior angles of a quadrilateral form an arithmetic sequence. If the measure of the largest angle is $129^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the second largest angle, in degrees?",
        "inference": "Let the angles be $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$.\n\nWe have $a+3d=129$.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is $360^{\\circ}$, so $a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+(a+3d)=360$.\n\nSubstituting $a+3d=129$, we get $4a+6d=231$.\n\nSince $a+3d=129$, we have $a=129-3d$.\n\nSubstituting this into $4a+6d=231$, we get $4(129-3d)+6d=231$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $516-12d+6d=231$.\n\nSolving for $d$, we get $d=47$.\n\nTherefore, the second largest angle is $a+d=129-3d+d=129-3(47)+47=\\boxed{82}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{82}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$, so the second largest angle is $129-d$ degrees, the third largest is $129-2d$ degrees, and the smallest angle is $129-3d$ degrees. We know that the sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is equal to 360 degrees, so we have the equation $129 + (129-d) + (129-2d) + (129-3d) = 360$, from which we find that $d=26$ degrees. Thus, the second largest angle is $129-d=129-26=\\boxed{103}$ degrees."
