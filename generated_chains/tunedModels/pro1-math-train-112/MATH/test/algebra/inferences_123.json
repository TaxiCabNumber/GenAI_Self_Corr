        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $j$ is perpendicular to $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. What is the slope of line $j$?",
        "inference": "The slope of a line perpendicular to another line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line.\n\nThe slope of the given line is $-\\frac{3}{2}$, so the slope of line $j$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the slope of $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. We change the form to slope-intercept form. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $y+\\frac{6x}{5}=6$. Moving the $x$ to the right, we get $y=-\\frac{6x}{5}+6$. The slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $j$ is the opposite reciprocal of $-\\frac{6}{5}$ which is $\\boxed{\\frac56}$."
