        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe perimeter of the polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides.\n\nThe length of side $AB$ is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is:\n$$AB = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (6-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{225} = 15$$\n\nThe length of side $BC$ is the distance between points $B$ and $C$, which is:\n$$BC = \\sqrt{(9-9)^2 + (-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$$\n\nThe length of side $CA$ is the distance between points $C$ and $A$, which is:\n$$CA = \\sqrt{(-6-9)^2 + (6-(-2))^2} = \\sqrt{(-15)^2 + (8)^2} = \\sqrt{225 + 64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$$\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the polygon is:\n$$Perimeter = AB + BC + CA = 15 + 8 + 17 = \\boxed{40}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{40}.

        "ground_truth": "Two side lengths are straightforward.  We have $AB = 15$ because the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are the same and their $x$-coordinates differ by 15.  Similarly, the $y$-coordinates of $B$ and $C$ differ by 8 and their $x$-coordinates are the same, so $BC = 8$.  We could either notice that $\\triangle ABC$ is right, or use the distance formula (i.e., the Pythagorean Theorem) to see that  \\[AC = \\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (-2-6)^2} = \\sqrt{15^2 + (-8)^2} = 17.\\] So, the perimeter of $ABC$ is $15+8+17 = \\boxed{40}$."
