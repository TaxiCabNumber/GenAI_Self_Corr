        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first term of an arithmetic sequence is 1, another term of the sequence is 91 and all of the terms of the sequence are integers. How many distinct arithmetic sequences meet these three conditions?",
        "inference": "Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be d. Then, the second term is 1 + d, the third term is 1 + 2d, and so on. Since 91 is a term of the sequence, we have 1 + nd = 91 for some integer n. Solving for n, we get n = 90/d. Since n is an integer, d must be a divisor of 90. The divisors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. For each of these values of d, we can construct a distinct arithmetic sequence that meets the given conditions. Therefore, there are 12 distinct arithmetic sequences that meet the given conditions.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An arithmetic sequence is formed by adding the common difference to each term to find the next term.  Thus, the common difference must evenly divide the difference $91-1=90$.  Each factor of 90 will correspond to one possible sequence.  For example, the factor 30 corresponds to the sequence $1,31,61,91,...$.  So, we need to count the factors of 90.  Factoring, we find: $$90=2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5$$ So, 90 has: $$(1+1)(2+1)(1+1)=12\\text{ factors}$$ This corresponds to $\\boxed{12}$ possible sequences."
