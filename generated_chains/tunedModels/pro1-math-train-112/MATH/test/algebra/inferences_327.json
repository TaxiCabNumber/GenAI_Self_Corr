        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, what is the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable in the polynomial.\n\nThe degree of $p(t)$ is 7, and the degree of $q(t)$ is 7.\n\nWhen two polynomials are multiplied, the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials.\n\nTherefore, the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$ is $7+7=\\boxed{14}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $t^7$ terms multiply to a $t^{14}$ term.  All the other terms multiply to terms of lesser degree, so the degree of the product of polynomials is $\\boxed{14}$."
