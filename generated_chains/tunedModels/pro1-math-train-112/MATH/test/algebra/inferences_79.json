        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA horse 64 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 27 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 16 feet from the center have to make?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe distance traveled by the horse is equal to the circumference of the circle it travels around. The circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nFor the horse 64 feet from the center, the radius is 64 feet, so the circumference is $C = 2\\pi (64) = 128\\pi$ feet.\n\nFor the horse 16 feet from the center, the radius is 16 feet, so the circumference is $C = 2\\pi (16) = 32\\pi$ feet.\n\nTo travel the same distance as the horse 64 feet from the center, the horse 16 feet from the center would have to make $\\frac{128\\pi}{32\\pi} = 4$ revolutions.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions."
