At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $-4$ is a solution to $x^2 + bx -36 = 0$, what is the value of $b$?",
        "inference": "Since $-4$ is a solution to $x^2 + bx -36 = 0$, we can substitute $-4$ for $x$ in the equation and get:\n\n$$(-4)^2 + b(-4) -36 = 0$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$16 -4b -36 = 0$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$$-20 -4b = 0$$\n\nDividing both sides by $-4$, we get:\n\n$$b = 5$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}.

        "ground_truth": "The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\\boxed{-5}$."
