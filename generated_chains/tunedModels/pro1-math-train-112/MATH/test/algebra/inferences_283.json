        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ is 88. If we decrease $a$ by 5, we get $N$. If we increase $b$ by 5, we get $N$. If we multiply $c$ by 5, we get $N$. What is the value of $N$?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\n$a + b + c = 88$\n$a - 5 = N$\n$b + 5 = N$\n$c * 5 = N$\nFrom the first equation, we can get $a = 88 - b - c$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation, we get $88 - b - c - 5 = N$.\nSimplify, we get $83 - b - c = N$.\nFrom the third equation, we can get $b = N - 5$.\nSubstitute this into the fourth equation, we get $83 - (N - 5) - c = N$.\nSimplify, we get $88 - N + 5 - c = N$.\nCombine like terms, we get $93 - c = 2N$.\nDivide both sides by 2, we get $46.5 - c/2 = N$.\nTherefore, $N = \\boxed{46.5 - c/2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{46.5 - c/2}$.
