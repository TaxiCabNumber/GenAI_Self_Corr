A new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has sum 16 times the sum of the original series.  The common ratio of the original series is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",
        "inference": "Let the first term of the original series be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$. Then the sum of the original series is $S = \\frac{a}{1-r} = 2000$.\n\nThe sum of the squared series is $S^2 = \\frac{a^2}{(1-r)^2} = 16S$.\n\nSubstituting $S = 2000$, we get $\\frac{a^2}{(1-r)^2} = 16 \\cdot 2000 = 32000$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $a^2 = 32000(1-r)^2$.\n\nSince $a$ and $r$ are rational, $a^2$ is rational.
