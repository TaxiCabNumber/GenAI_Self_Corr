        "inference": "The quadratic equation has one real solution if and only if the discriminant is zero. The discriminant is $m^2 - 4(m+n) = m^2 - 4m - 4n$. Setting this equal to zero and solving for $m$, we get $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$, $(m - 2)^2 - 4n - 4 = 0$, $(m - 2)^2 = 4n + 4$, $m - 2 = \\pm \\sqrt{4n + 4}$, $m = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{4n + 4}$. Since there is a unique value of $m$, we must have $m = 2 + \\sqrt{4n + 4}$. Substituting this into the equation $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$, we get $(2 + \\sqrt{4n + 4})^2 - 4(2 + \\sqrt{4n + 4}) - 4n = 0$, $4 + 4\\sqrt{4n + 4} + (4n + 4) - 8 - 4\\sqrt{4n + 4} - 4n = 0$, $4n + 4 = 0$, $n = -1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$.

        "ground_truth": "If the given quadratic equation has one solution, it follows that its discriminant must be equal to $0$. The discriminant of the given quadratic is given by $m^2 - 4(m+n)$, and setting this equal to zero, we obtain another quadratic equation $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$. Since the value of $m$ is unique, it follows that again, the discriminant of this quadratic must be equal to zero. The discriminant is now $4^2 - 4(-4n) = 16 + 16n = 0$, so it follows that $n = \\boxed{-1}$."
