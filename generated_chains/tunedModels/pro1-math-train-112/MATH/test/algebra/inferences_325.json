        "ground_truth": "We begin by multiplying the first equation by 2, giving us a system of two equations \\begin{align*} 2d-12c&=8\n\\\\ 2d-9c&=20\n\\end{align*}From here, we can subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(2d-12c)-(2d-9c)=8-20$, which simplifies to $-3c=-12$ or $c=4$. Since we now know the value of $c$, we can plug this back into the first equation to solve for $d$.
