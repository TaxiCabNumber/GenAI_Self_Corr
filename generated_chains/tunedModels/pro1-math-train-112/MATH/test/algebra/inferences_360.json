At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the product of all positive integer values of $c$ such that $3x^2+7x+c=0$ has two real roots.",
        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $3x^2+7x+c=0$ is $7^2-4(3)(c)=49-12c$. For the equation to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, we have $49-12c\\ge0$, which gives $c\\le\\frac{49}{12}$. Since $c$ is a positive integer, the only possible value of $c$ is $c=4$. Therefore, the product of all positive integer values of $c$ such that $3x^2+7x+c=0$ has two real roots is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}7^2-4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot c &> 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ 49-12c &>0\\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\ c&<\\frac{49}{12}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{49}{12}$ is 4. Thus, the positive integer values of $c$ are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their product is $\\boxed{24}$."
