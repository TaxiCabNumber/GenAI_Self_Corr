At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf Wonder Woman can capture 6 criminals in an hour, how many can she capture in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours?",
        "inference": "1. Convert $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours to hours: $4\\frac{1}{2} = 4.5$ hours.\n2. Multiply the number of hours by the number of criminals captured per hour: $4.5 \\times 6 = 27$.\n3. Therefore, Wonder Woman can capture 27 criminals in $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the number of criminals that Wonder Woman can capture in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours, we multiply how many criminals she can capture per hour by the number of hours she spends capturing criminals. Thus, she can capture $6 \\cdot (4 \\frac{1}{2})=6 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ criminals in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours."
