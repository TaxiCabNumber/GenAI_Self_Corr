At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 40 and their difference is 12. What is their product?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be x and y.\nThen, x + y = 40 and x - y = 12.\nAdding the two equations, we get 2x = 52, so x = 26.\nSubstituting this value of x in the first equation, we get y = 14.\nTherefore, the product of the two numbers is xy = 26 * 14 = 364.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{364}.
