At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the function $j(x)$ is defined only on domain $[-1,2]$, and is defined on this domain by the formula $$j(x) = 2x^2+1,$$ then what is the range of $j(x)$? Express your answer as an interval or as a union of intervals.",
        "inference": "The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. To find the range of $j(x)$, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $j(x)$ on the domain $[-1,2]$.\n\nThe minimum value of $j(x)$ occurs at the endpoints of the domain, where $x=-1$ and $x=2$. At these points, $j(x)=2(-1)^2+1=3$ and $j(x)=2(2)^2+1=9$, respectively.\n\nThe maximum value of $j(x)$ occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at $x=-b/2a=-0/4=0$. At this point, $j(x)=2(0)^2+1=1$.\n\nTherefore, the range of $j(x)$ is the interval $[1,9]$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{[1,9]}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $x^2$ assumes every value from $0$ to $4$, inclusive, as $x$ varies throughout the interval $[-1,2]$. Therefore, $j(x)$ assumes every value from $2(0)+1=1$ to $2(4)+1=9$ (and no other values). The range of $j(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,9]}$."
