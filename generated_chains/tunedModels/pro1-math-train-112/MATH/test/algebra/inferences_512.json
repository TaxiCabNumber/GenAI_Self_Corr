From the second equation, we see that either $2a = 1$ or else $b = 0$. But if $b = 0$, then the first equation gives $2a = -a$, implying that $a = 0$. This makes the two solutions of our original polynomial the same, and we are given that they are distinct. Hence $b \\not=0$, so $2a = 1,$ or $a = 1/2$. Then $b = -3a = -3/2$, so $a+b = \\boxed{-1}$."
