        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI choose a random integer $n$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive. What is the probability that for the $n$ I chose, there exist no real solutions to the equation $x(x+5) = -n$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The equation $x(x+5) = -n$ has no real solutions if and only if $n$ is positive. There are $5$ positive integers between $1$ and $10$ inclusive, so the probability that $n$ is positive is $\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
