        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of the triangle is 60 units, so $a+b+c=60$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are in arithmetic sequence, we have $b=a+d$ and $c=a+2d$ for some integer $d$. Substituting these into the perimeter equation, we get $a+(a+d)+(a+2d)=60$, which simplifies to $3a+3d=60$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $a+d=20$. Since $a$ and $d$ are integers, the only possible values for $a$ and $d$ are $a=17$ and $d=3$, or $a=14$ and $d=6$.\n\nIf $a=17$ and $d=3$, then $b=a+d=17+3=20$ and $c=a+2d=17+2(3)=23$. This gives us the triangle with side lengths 17, 20, and 23.\n\nIf $a=14$ and $d=6$, then $b=a+d=14+6=20$ and $c=a+2d=14+2(6)=26$. This gives us the triangle with side lengths 14, 20, and 26.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles."
