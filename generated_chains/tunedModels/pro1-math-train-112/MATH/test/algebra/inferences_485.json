        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. If the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $y$ be the number of oranges Kim can buy with the same amount of money at the new price.\n\nThen, $3x \\cdot 40 = 4x \\cdot y$\n\nSimplifying, we get $120x = 4xy$\n\nDividing both sides by $4x$, we get $30 = y$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$30$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges."
