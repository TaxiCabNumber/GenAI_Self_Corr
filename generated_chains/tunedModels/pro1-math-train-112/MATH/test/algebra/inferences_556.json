        "inference": "Since the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $1$. The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $a(1)^2+b(1)+c=a+b+c$.\n\nSince the parabola goes through the point $(-1,3)$, we have $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=3$. This simplifies to $a-b+c=3$.\n\nSince the parabola goes through the point $(2,-2)$, we have $a(2)^2+b(2)+c=-2$. This simplifies to $4a+2b+c=-2$.\n\nWe are given that the quadratic $ax^2 + bx +c$  has two real roots. This means that the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is greater than $0$.\n\nWe are also given that the greater root is $\\sqrt{n}+1$. This means that the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx +c=0$ has a solution $x=\\sqrt{n}+1$. Substituting this into the quadratic equation, we get $a(\\sqrt{n}+1)^2 + b(\\sqrt{n}+1) +c=0$.

        "ground_truth": "Rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=1$, so $h=1$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-1)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-1-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow 3=4a+k\\\\\n-2&=a(2-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow -2=a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $5=3a$, so $a=5/3$. Plugging this value into the second equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=-11/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}$. To find the zeros of the parabola, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{11}{3}&=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2 &\\\\\n\\frac{11}{5}&=(x-1)^2\\\\\nx &= \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe greater zero is at $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}+1$, so $n=\\boxed{2.2}$.
