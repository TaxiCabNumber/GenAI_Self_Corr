At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind all positive integer values of $c$ such that the equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ only has roots that are real and rational. Express them in decreasing order, separated by commas.",
        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ is $b^2-4ac=(-7)^2-4(1)(c)=49-4c$. For the equation to have real and rational roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $49-4c=k^2$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $c$, we get $c=49-k^2$. Since $c$ is positive, we have $k^2<49$, so $k$ can be $1,2,3,4,5,6$, or $7$. Therefore, the possible values of $c$ are $48,45,40,33,24,13$, and $0$. In decreasing order, these values are $\\boxed{48,45,40,33,24,13,0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48,45,40,33,24,13,0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\\boxed{12, 10, 6}$."
