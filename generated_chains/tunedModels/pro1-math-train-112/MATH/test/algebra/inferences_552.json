        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne day, I decide to run to the park. On the way there, I run at a rate of $x^2$ miles per hour for $3$ hours. On the way back, I take the same path and jog at a slower rate of $16 - 4x$ miles per hour so that it takes me $4$ hours to get home. Given that $x > 0$, what is $x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $d$ be the distance to the park. Then, the time it takes to run to the park is $\\frac{d}{x^2}$ hours, and the time it takes to jog back home is $\\frac{d}{16 - 4x}$ hours. Since it takes me $3$ hours to run to the park and $4$ hours to jog back home, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{x^2} = 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d = 3x^2$$\n\n$$\\frac{d}{16 - 4x} = 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d = 64 - 16x$$\n\nSetting these two expressions for $d$ equal to each other, we get:\n\n$$3x^2 = 64 - 16x$$\n\n$$3x^2 + 16x - 64 = 0$$\n\n$$(3x - 8)(x + 8) = 0$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{8}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -8$$\n\nSince $x > 0$, we have $x = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{8}{3}$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since we know that the distance that I traveled to the park and the distance that I traveled to get back home are the same, and that distance $=$ rate $\\times$ time, we have that  \\begin{align*}\n& (x^2)(3) = (16 - 4x)(4) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 = 64 - 16x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 16x - 64 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & (3x - 8)(x + 8) = 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get the solutions $x = \\frac{8}{3}$ and $x = -8$.
