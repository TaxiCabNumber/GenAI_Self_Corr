At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI pick two whole numbers $x$ and $y$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive (not necessarily distinct). My friend picks two numbers $x -4$ and $2y-1$. If the product of my friend's numbers is one greater than the product of my numbers, then what is the product of my numbers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers I pick. Then my friend picks the numbers $x-4$ and $2y-1$. The product of my numbers is $xy$, and the product of my friend's numbers is $(x-4)(2y-1)=2xy-x-8y+4$. Since the product of my friend's numbers is one greater than the product of my numbers, we have\n\n$$2xy-x-8y+4=xy+1$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get\n\n$$xy-x-8y=-3$$\n\n$$xy-8y=x-3$$\n\n$$y(x-8)=x-3$$\n\n$$y=\\frac{x-3}{x-8}$$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both integers between $1$ and $10$ inclusive, the only possible solution is $x=9$ and $y=2$. Therefore, the product of my numbers is $xy=\\boxed{18}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From the information given, we can construct the following equation: $xy + 1 = (x-4)(2y-1)$. This simplifies to $xy - x - 8y = -3$. We can then apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $xy - x - 8y + 8 = 5$. This can be factored into $$(x-8)(y-1)=5$$Since $x\\leq 10$, $x=9$ and $y=6$. Thus, the product of my two numbers is $9 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{54}$."
