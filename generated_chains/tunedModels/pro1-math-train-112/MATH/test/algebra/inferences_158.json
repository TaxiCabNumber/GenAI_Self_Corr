        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches?",
        "inference": "Let x be the length of the rectangle and y be the width of the rectangle.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 12 inches, so we have the equation:\n\n2x + 2y = 12\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 6 - x\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the equation:\n\nA = xy\n\nSubstituting y = 6 - x into the equation for the area, we get:\n\nA = x(6 - x)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\nA = 6x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola represented by the equation A = 6x - x^2. The vertex of a parabola is given by the equation:\n\nx = -b/2a\n\nIn this case, a = -1 and b = 6, so the vertex is:\n\nx = -6/2(-1) = 3\n\nSubstituting x = 3 into the equation for y, we get:\n\ny = 6 - 3 = 3\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the rectangle is:\n\nA = xy = 3 * 3 = 9 square inches\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square."
