At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the weight of a squig as \"S\", a trek as \"T\", and a goolee as \"G\".\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n2T + G = S\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n10T = 6T + 4G\n4T = 4G\nT = G\n\nNow, we can substitute T = G back into the second equation:\n\n2T + G = S\n2G + G = S\n3G = S\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of **3 treeks** equals the weight of one squig.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \\begin{align*}\n10t &=3s+g\\\\\n2t +g &= s.\n\\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \\begin{align*}\n10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow s &=3t.\n\\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\\boxed{3}$ treeks."
