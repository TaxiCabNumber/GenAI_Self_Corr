At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of the arithmetic series $28 + 30 + 32 + \\cdots + 86$?",
        "inference": "The first term is $a_1 = 28$ and the last term is $a_n = 86$. The common difference is $d = 2$. The number of terms is $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1 = \\frac{86 - 28}{2} + 1 = 30$. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. Therefore, the sum of the given series is $S_{30} = \\frac{30}{2}(28 + 86) = 15(114) = 1710$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1710}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The common difference is 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in the sequence is $28 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 26$.  If $2n + 26 = 86$, then $n = 30$, so the sequence contains 30 terms.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $\\frac{(28 + 86)}{2} \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{1710}$."
