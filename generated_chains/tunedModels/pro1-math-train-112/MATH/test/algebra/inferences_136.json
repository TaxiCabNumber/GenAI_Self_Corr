        "inference": "**Solution:**\n$$\\sqrt{120-\\sqrt{x}}$$ is an integer if and only if $120-\\sqrt{x}$ is a perfect square.  Let $y=\\sqrt{x}$.  Then $120-y$ is a perfect square if and only if $y^2-120$ is a perfect square.  This is true if and only if $y^2-120=k^2$ for some integer $k$.  This is equivalent to $y^2-k^2=120$, which is true if and only if $(y+k)(y-k)=120$.  Since $y+k$ and $y-k$ are both integers, the only possible values of $y+k$ and $y-k$ are $1$ and $120$, $2$ and $60$, $3$ and $40$, $4$ and $30$, $5$ and $24$, $6$ and $20$, $8$ and $15$, and $10$ and $12$.  Since $y=\\sqrt{x}$, the only possible values of $x$ are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $64$, and $100$.
