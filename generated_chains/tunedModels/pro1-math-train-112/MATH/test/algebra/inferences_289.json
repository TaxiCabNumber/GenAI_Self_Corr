        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of teachers to students in a particular school is 1 to 11. The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. If there are 396 female students, how many teachers are there?",
        "inference": "Let the number of teachers be x and the number of students be 11x.\n\nSince there are 396 female students, the number of male students is 11x - 396.\n\nThe ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, so we have:\n\n396 / (11x) = 4 / 9\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n396 * 9 = 4 * 11x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3564 = 44x\n\nDividing both sides by 44, we get:\n\nx = 81\n\nTherefore, the number of teachers is 81.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{81}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total."
