At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach successive term in the sequence $243, 81, x,\ny, 3, \\ldots$ is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant. What is the value of $x + y$?",
