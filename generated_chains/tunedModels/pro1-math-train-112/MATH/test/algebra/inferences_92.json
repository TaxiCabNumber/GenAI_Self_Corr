At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  If $f(1)=2$, $f(2) = 6$, and $f(3)=5$, then what is $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))$?",
        "inference": "Since $f(2)=6$, we have $f^{-1}(6)=2$.  Since $f(1)=2$, we have $f^{-1}(2)=1$.  Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
