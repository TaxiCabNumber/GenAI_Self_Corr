At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?",
        "inference": "The denominator of the function is $x^2+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)$. So, the vertical asymptotes are $x=-3$ and $x=2$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes."
