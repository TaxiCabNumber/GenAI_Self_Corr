        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSquare A and Square B are both $2009$ by $2009$ squares.  Square A has both its length and width increased by an amount $x$, while Square B has its length and width decreased by the same amount $x$.  What is the minimum value of $x$ such that the difference in area between the two new squares is at least as great as the area of a $2009$ by $2009$ square?",
        "inference": "The area of Square A is $(2009+x)(2009+x)$, and the area of Square B is $(2009-x)(2009-x)$.  The difference in area is $(2009+x)(2009+x)-(2009-x)(2009-x)=4x(2009+x)$.  We want this to be at least as great as the area of a $2009$ by $2009$ square, which is $2009^2$.  Therefore, we want $4x(2009+x)\\ge2009^2$.  Solving for $x$, we get $x\\ge\\frac{2009^2}{4(2009+x)}$.  Since $x$ must be an integer, the minimum value of $x$ is $\\boxed{1004}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1004}$. I hope it is correct.",
