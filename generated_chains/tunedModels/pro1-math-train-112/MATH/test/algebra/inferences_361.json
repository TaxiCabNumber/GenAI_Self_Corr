At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve friends met for dinner at Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House, and each ordered one meal. The portions were so large, there was enough food for 18 people. If they share, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?",
        "inference": "12 friends ordered 12 meals, which was enough for 18 people. So, 1 meal was enough for 18/12 = 3/2 people. To have just enough food for 12 people, they should have ordered 12 * 2/3 = 8 meals.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If 12 people order $\\frac{18}{12}=1\\frac{1}{2}$ times too much food, they should have ordered $\\frac{12}{\\frac{3}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3}\\times 12=\\boxed{8}$ meals."
