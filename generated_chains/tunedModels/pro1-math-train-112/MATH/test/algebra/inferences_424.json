At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $a$ is parallel to line $b$ and goes through the point $(1,2)$. Line $b$ goes through the point $(3,1)$ and is perpendicular to line $c$ whose equation is $y=-2x+3$. Find the y-intercept of line $a$.",
        "inference": "Since line $a$ is parallel to line $b$, they have the same slope. Since line $b$ is perpendicular to line $c$, the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $c$. The slope of line $c$ is $-2$, so the slope of line $b$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince line $a$ goes through the point $(1,2)$, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find its equation:\n\n$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$\n\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line. Substituting in the values we know, we get:\n\n$$y-2=\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$y=\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nThe y-intercept of a line is the value of $y$ when $x=0$. Substituting in $x=0$, we get:\n\n$$y=\\frac{1}{2}(0)+\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of $-2$, which is $\\frac12$. The slopes of parallel lines are the same, therefore the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac12$. Using the point-slope formula, the equation of line $a$ is $y-2=\\frac12(x-1)$. Changing the form to slope-intercept, we get the equation $y=\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac32$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{\\frac32}$."
