I hope it is correct.'\nFor each positive integer $k$, let $S_k$ denote the increasing arithmetic sequence of integers whose first term is 1 and whose common difference is $k$.  For example, $S_3$ is the sequence $1,4,7,\\ldots$.  For how many values of $k$ does $S_k$ contain $2005$ as a term?",
        "inference": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence with first term $a$ and common difference $d$ is given by $a+(n-1)d$.  Since $S_k$ is an increasing arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference $k$, the $n$th term of $S_k$ is $1+(n-1)k$.  We want to find the values of $k$ for which $1+(n-1)k=2005$.  Solving for $k$, we get $k=\\frac{2005-1}{n-1}=\\frac{2004}{n-1}$.  Since $k$ is a positive integer, $n-1$ must be a divisor of 2004.  The divisors of 2004 are $1,2,3,4,6,12,169,338,501,676,1002,2004$.  Therefore, the values of $k$ for which $S_k$ contains 2005 as a term are $k=2,3,4,6,12,169,338,501,676,1002,2004$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$",
        "ground_truth": "The general term of the sequence is $a_n = 1 + kn$, where $a_0 = 1$ is the first term. Therefore, we want $1 + kn = 2005$, or $kn = 2004$. We see that this equation has a solution for $n$ if and only if $k$ is a divisor of $2004$. Since $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$, the number of positive divisors of $2004$ is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = \\boxed{12}$."
