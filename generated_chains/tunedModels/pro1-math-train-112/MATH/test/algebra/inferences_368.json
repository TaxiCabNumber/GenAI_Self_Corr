At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 153, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.7. What is the value of $y - x$?",
        "inference": "Let's start by setting up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. $x + y = 153$\n2. $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.7$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$x = 0.7y$\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$0.7y + y = 153$\n$1.7y = 153$\n$y = 90$\n\nNow that we have the value of $y$, we can find $x$ using the equation $x = 0.7y$:\n\n$x = 0.7(90) = 63$\n\nFinally, we can calculate $y - x$:\n\n$y - x = 90 - 63 = \\boxed{27}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$."
