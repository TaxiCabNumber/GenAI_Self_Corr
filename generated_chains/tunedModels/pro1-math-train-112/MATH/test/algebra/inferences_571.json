        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)=\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^x\\right\\rfloor$ be a function that is defined for all values of $x$ in $[0,\\infty)$ such that $f(x)$ is a real number. How many distinct values exist in the range of $f(x)$?",
        "inference": "Since $-\\frac58$ is negative, $\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^x$ is negative for all $x>0$. Therefore, $f(x)=0$ for all $x>0$. Also, $f(0)=0$. Thus, the range of $f(x)$ contains only one distinct value.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $-\\frac58$ is a negative number, $f(x)$ is only defined for integer values of $x$, and will alternate between positive and negative values. Additionally, $\\left|-\\frac58\\right|< 1$, so $|f(x)|$ will continually decrease and approach 0 as $x$ increases in the interval $x\\ge0$. Therefore, the largest positive value will occur at $x=0$, giving us the positive upper bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^0\\right\\rfloor=1$. The negative value that is greatest in magnitude then occurs at the next integer value of $x$: $x=1$, giving us the negative lower bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^1\\right\\rfloor=-1$. This tells us that $-1 \\le f(x) \\le 1$. Since the $f(x)$ must be an integer, the only possible distinct values contained in the range are -1, 0, and 1. This gives us a total of $\\boxed{3}$ values of $f(x)$ when $x\\ge0$."
