At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA line parallel to $3x-7y = 65$ passes through the point $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$. What is the value of K?",
        "inference": "The equation of the line parallel to $3x-7y = 65$ is $3x-7y = C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nSince the line passes through the point $(7,4)$, we have $3(7)-7(4) = C$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $C = 21 - 28 = -7$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $3x-7y = -7$.\n\nSince the line also passes through the point $(0,K)$, we have $3(0)-7(K) = -7$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $-7K = -7$.\n\nDividing both sides by $-7$, we get $K = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form by solving for $y$: $y=\\frac{65-3x}{-7}$. That means the slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{7}$, and the slope of a parallel line must also be $\\frac{3}{7}$. The slope of the line through $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$ is $\\frac{4-K}{7-0}$, which we set equal to $\\frac{3}{7}$ and solve for $K$. $$\\frac{4-K}{7}=\\frac{3}{7}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 4-K=3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow 1=K$$ So the value of K is $\\boxed{1}$."
