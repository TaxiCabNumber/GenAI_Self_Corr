I hope it is correct.'\nSue can either borrow $10,\\!000$ dollars for $5$ years with a simple interest of $7\\%$ annually or an interest which compounds annually for $6\\%$. How much more money, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she have to pay back for the more expensive interest than the less expensive interest?",
