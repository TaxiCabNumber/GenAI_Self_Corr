At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 60 feet per second from a height of 54 feet from the ground, where $t$ represents time, measured in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to find when its height is 0. So we set $y = 0$ and solve for $t$:\n\n$$0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$$\n\n$$16t^2 + 60t - 54 = 0$$\n\n$$(4t - 3)(4t + 18) = 0$$\n\n$$4t - 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 4t + 18 = 0$$\n\n$$4t = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 4t = -18$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{3}{4} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t = -\\frac{9}{2}$$\n\nSince time cannot be negative, we discard the second solution.
