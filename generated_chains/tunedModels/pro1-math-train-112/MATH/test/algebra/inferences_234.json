        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is triple the number of units in its perimeter. What is the smallest possible length for the perimeter?",
        "inference": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively. Then, the area of the rectangle is $lw$, and the perimeter is $2l + 2w$. Since the area is triple the perimeter, we have:\n\n$$lw = 3(2l + 2w)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$lw = 6l + 6w$$\n\n$$lw - 6l - 6w = 0$$\n\n$$l(w - 6) - 6(w - 6) = 0$$\n\n$$(l - 6)(w - 6) = 0$$\n\nThis means that either $l - 6 = 0$ or $w - 6 = 0$. If $l - 6 = 0$, then $l = 6$, and if $w - 6 = 0$, then $w = 6$. Therefore, the smallest possible length for the perimeter is $2l + 2w = 2(6) + 2(6) = \\boxed{24}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=6a+6b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have, $ab - 6a - 6b =0$.  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  36 works here:  $$ab - 6a - 6b + 36 = 36 \\implies (a-6)(b-6)=36$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  Thus, the possible factor pairs of $36$ are $(1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9)$.  As we can quickly see, $4 + 9 = 13$ is the smallest sum for any of those pairs, so $a = 10, b = 15$, with a total perimeter of $\\boxed{50}$, is the smallest possible perimeter."
