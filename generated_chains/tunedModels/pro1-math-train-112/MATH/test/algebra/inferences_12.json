At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system?",
        "inference": "The distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 8 and 6. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{8^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{64+36}=\\sqrt{100}=10$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$."
