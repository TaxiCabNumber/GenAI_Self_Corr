At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of playing cards with $26$ red cards and $26$ black cards is split into two piles, each having at least one card. In pile $A$ there are six times as many black cards as red cards. In pile $B,$ the number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. How many red cards are in pile $B?$",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of red cards in pile $A$. Then the number of black cards in pile $A$ is $6x$. The total number of cards in pile $A$ is $x + 6x = 7x$.\n\nLet $y$ be the number of black cards in pile $B$. Then the number of red cards in pile $B$ is a multiple of $y$. Let $z$ be the number of red cards in pile $B$. Then $z = ky$ for some integer $k$.\n\nThe total number of cards in pile $B$ is $y + z = y + ky = y(k + 1)$.\n\nThe total number of cards in the deck is $26 + 26 = 52$. Therefore, the total number of cards in piles $A$ and $B$ is $7x + y(k + 1) = 52$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers, $7x$ and $y(k + 1)$ are both positive integers. Therefore, $7x + y(k + 1)$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe only positive integer that is a multiple of $7$ and $52$ is $52$. Therefore, $7x + y(k + 1) = 52$.\n\nSince $7x$ is a multiple of $7$, $y(k + 1)$ must also be a multiple of $7$. The only positive integer that is a multiple of $7$ and less than $52$ is $7$. Therefore, $y(k + 1) = 7$.\n\nSince $y$ is a positive integer, $k + 1$ must also be a positive integer. The only positive integer that is a factor of $7$ is $1$. Therefore, $k + 1 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $k = 0$. Therefore, $z = ky = 0$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{0}$ red cards in pile $B$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
