At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate.  After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars.  What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage?  (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
        "inference": "Let r be the annual interest rate, as a percentage. Then, the amount of money in the fund after three years is 1000(1 + r/100)^3. Since this is equal to 1225, we have 1000(1 + r/100)^3 = 1225. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get (1 + r/100)^3 = 1.225. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get 1 + r/100 = 1.079. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get r/100 = 0.079. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get r = 7.9. Rounding to the nearest integer, we get r = 8.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
