At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly. Then, the number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80-x$.\n\nFrank's score is given by:\n\n$$5x-2(80-x)=232$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$5x-160+2x=232$$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$$7x=392$$\n\nDividing both sides by $7$:\n\n$$x=56$$\n\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly."
