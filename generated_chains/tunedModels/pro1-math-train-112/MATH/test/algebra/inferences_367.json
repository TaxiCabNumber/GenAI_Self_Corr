        "ground_truth": "The shortest line from the point $(6,0)$ to the given line will be perpendicular to it.  A line perpendicular to $y=2x-2$ will have a slope of $-1/2$.

Substituting the point $(6,0)$ that we know must lie on this line, we find: $$0=-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6 +b$$ $$3=b$$ The equation of the perpendicular line is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+3$.
