        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the cost of one cookie.\nSince 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, the cost of one cookie is 2/6 = 1/3 of the cost of one brownie.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the cost of one brownie.\nSince 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, the cost of one brownie is 10/4 = 5/2 of the cost of one cupcake.\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the cost of 18 cookies.\nSince 18 cookies cost 3 times the cost of one cookie, the cost of 18 cookies is 3 * (1/3) = 1 times the cost of one brownie.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the number of cupcakes Bob can buy for the price of 18 cookies.\nSince the cost of 18 cookies is the same as the cost of one brownie, and one brownie costs 5/2 of the cost of one cupcake, Bob can buy 5/2 cupcakes for the price of 18 cookies.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{5/2}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes."
