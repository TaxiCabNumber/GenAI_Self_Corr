I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle has all three of its vertices on the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$. One vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola, and the opposite side lies along the line $y=k$. What is the value of $k$?",
        "inference": "The vertex of the parabola is at $(4,-11)$. Since the triangle is equilateral, the other two vertices must be equidistant from the vertex. Let the other two vertices be $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. Then, we have:\n\n$$d((x_1,y_1),(4,-11))=d((x_2,y_2),(4,-11))$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{(x_1-4)^2+(y_1+11)^2}=\\sqrt{(x_2-4)^2+(y_2+11)^2}$$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$$(x_1-4)^2+(y_1+11)^2=(x_2-4)^2+(y_2+11)^2$$\n\n$$x_1^2-8x_1+16+y_1^2+22y_1+121=x_2^2-8x_2+16+y_2^2+22y_2+121$$\n\n$$x_1^2-8x_1+y_1^2+22y_1=x_2^2-8x_2+y_2^2+22y_2$$\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, we also have:\n\n$$x_1=x_2$$\n\n$$y_1=y_2$$\n\nSubstituting these into the previous equation, we get:\n\n$$x^2-8x+y^2+22y=x^2-8x+y^2+22y$$\n\n$$0=0$$\n\nThis is true for any value of $x$ and $y$, so the other two vertices can be any points on the parabola. Since the opposite side lies along the line $y=k$, we have:\n\n$$y_1=k$$\n\n$$y_2=k$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{k}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$k$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "One vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)}=4$. To find the $y$-coordinate, we plug in $x=4$ to find $y=4^2-8\\cdot 4+5=16-32+5=-11$. So one vertex of the triangle is at $(4, -11)$.\n\nThe other two vertices are on the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$ and the line $y=k$. Thus we have $x^2-8x+5=k$ or $x^2-8x+(5-k)=0$. By the quadratic formula, the solutions to this equation are  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-(-8)\\pm\\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(1)(5-k)}}{2(1)}&=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{64-20+4k}}{2}\\\\\n&=4\\pm\\sqrt{11+k}.\n\\end{align*}So the two other vertices of the triangle are $(4-\\sqrt{11+k},k)$ and $(4+\\sqrt{11+k},k)$. Now, we know the triangle is equilateral. Since two vertices are on the same horizontal line, the side length is the difference of their $x$-coordinates, which is $(4+\\sqrt{11+k})-(4-\\sqrt{11+k})=2\\sqrt{11+k}$. The height of the equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{11+k})=\\sqrt{3(11+k)}$. But the height is also the difference in the $y$-coordinate between the vertex and the horizontal side which is at $y=k$. This means the height is equal to $k-(-11)=k+11$, since $-11$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex. These heights must be equal, so we can write the equation \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{3(11+k)}&=k+11\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3(11+k)&=(k+11)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n33+3k&=k^2+22k+121\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=k^2+19k+88\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(k+8)(k+11).\n\\end{align*}Thus we have $k=-8$ or $k=-11$. We can throw out $k=-11$ because then the line $y=-11$ intersects the parabola only once, at the vertex, so there's no triangle, just a point. Thus we have $k=\\boxed{-8}$."
