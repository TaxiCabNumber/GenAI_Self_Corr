At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOhm's law states that $V=IR$ for a simple circuit, where $V$ is the total voltage, $I$ is the amount of current running through the resistor and $R$ is the resistance of the resistor. If $I=40$ amperes when $R=3$ ohms, find the amount of current (in amperes) when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms. Assume voltage remains constant.",

        "ground_truth": "If $V=IR$ for a constant voltage $V$, then the total voltage of the circuit can be expressed as $V=(40)(3)=120$. Thus, when the resistance $R$ is $20$ ohms, the equation becomes: \\begin{align*} 120& =(I)(20)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad I& =\\frac{120}{20}\n\\\\ I& =\\boxed{6}\n\\end{align*}"
