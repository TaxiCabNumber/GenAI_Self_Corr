At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e. we must have $x^2-5x+6>0$.  Factoring, we get $(x-3)(x-2)>0$. So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive. They are both negative when $x<2$. They are both positive when $x>3$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<2 \\text{ or } x>3$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, 2) \\cup (3, \\infty)}$ in interval notation."
