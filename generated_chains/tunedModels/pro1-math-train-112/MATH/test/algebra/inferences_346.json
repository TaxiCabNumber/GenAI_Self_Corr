At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct rectangles are there with integer side lengths such that the numerical value of area of the rectangle in square units is equal to $5$ times the numerical value of the perimeter in units? (Two rectangles are considered to be distinct if they are not congruent.)",
        "inference": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively. Then, the area of the rectangle is $lw$ and the perimeter is $2l + 2w$. We are given that $lw = 5(2l + 2w)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $lw = 10l + 10w$. Dividing both sides by $w$, we get $l = 10 + 10/w$. Since $l$ is an integer, $w$ must be a divisor of $10$. The divisors of $10$ are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $10$. If $w = 1$, then $l = 11$, which is not an integer. If $w = 2$, then $l = 15$, which is not an integer. If $w = 5$, then $l = 12$, which is an integer. If $w = 10$, then $l = 11$, which is not an integer. Therefore, the only possible values of $w$ are $5$ and $10$. If $w = 5$, then $l = 12$. If $w = 10$, then $l = 11$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct rectangles that satisfy the given conditions.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property."
