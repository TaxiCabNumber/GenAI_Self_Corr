At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has common ratio $-1/2$ and sum 45.  What is the first term of the series?",
        "inference": "The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n$$S = \\frac{a}{1-r}$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, we have $S = 45$ and $r = -1/2$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$45 = \\frac{a}{1-(-1/2)}$$\n\n$$45 = \\frac{a}{3/2}$$\n\n$$a = 45 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\n$$a = 67.5$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$67.5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is 45, we have $45= a/[1-(-1/2)] = a/(3/2) = 2a/3$.  Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{135}{2}}$."
