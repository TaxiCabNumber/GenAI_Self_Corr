At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right rectangular prism with all integer edge lengths, and faces having areas of $30, 180$ and $24$ square centimeters?",
        "inference": "The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the product of its three dimensions. Let the dimensions be $a$, $b$, and $c$. Then, the volume is $V = abc$.\n\nWe are given that the faces have areas of $30, 180$, and $24$ square centimeters. The area of a face is given by the product of its two dimensions. Therefore, we have the following equations:\n\n$$ab = 30$$\n\n$$bc = 180$$\n\n$$ca = 24$$\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $a = \\frac{30}{b}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $b^2 = 60$. Therefore, $b = 6$.\n\nSubstituting $b = 6$ into the first equation, we get $a = 5$.\n\nSubstituting $b = 6$ and $a = 5$ into the third equation, we get $c = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the prism are $a = 5$, $b = 6$, and $c = 4$. The volume of the prism is $V = abc = 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the dimensions of the rectangular prism are given by $x$, $y$, and $z$, such that $xy = 30, yz = 180,$ and $zx = 24$. If we multiply all three equations together, we get that $xy \\cdot yz \\cdot zx = (xyz)^2 = 30 \\cdot 180 \\cdot 24$. Using prime factorizations, we find that the right-hand side is equal to $(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^3 \\cdot 3) = 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Thus, $(xyz)^2 = (2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5)^2$, so $xyz = \\boxed{360}$. This is the formula for the volume of the box."
