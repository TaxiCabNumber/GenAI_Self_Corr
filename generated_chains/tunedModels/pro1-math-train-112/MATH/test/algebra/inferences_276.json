        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou connect the points (0, 0) and (9, 6) with a line segment. Starting at (0, 0), you move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment. What is the sum of the coordinates of the point you land upon?",
        "inference": "The distance between (0, 0) and (9, 6) is $\\sqrt{(9-0)^2+(6-0)^2}=\\sqrt{81+36}=\\sqrt{117}$.\n\nMoving $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment means moving $\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}$ units from (0, 0).\n\nThe coordinates of the point you land upon are therefore $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}, \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{117}}\\sqrt{117}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}, 2\\right)$.\n\nThe sum of the coordinates is $\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}+2=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}+2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}\\sqrt{117}+2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since we move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment, we will move $\\frac{1}{3}(9-0) = 3$ units in the $x$-direction and $\\frac{1}{3}(6-0)= 2$ units in the $y$-direction. This means that we will end up at the point $(0 + 3, 0 + 2) = (3, 2)$. Adding the sum of the coordinates of this point, we find that the answer is $3 + 2 = \\boxed{5}$."
