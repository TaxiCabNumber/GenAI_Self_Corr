        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integers $n$ is $n^2-3n+2$ a prime number?",
        "inference": "We can factor $n^2-3n+2$ as $(n-1)(n-2)$.  Since $n$ is positive, $n-1$ and $n-2$ are both positive integers.  Therefore, $n^2-3n+2$ is a prime number if and only if $n-1=1$ or $n-2=1$.  Solving these equations, we get $n=2$ or $n=3$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers $n$ for which $n^2-3n+2$ is a prime number.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n \\ge 4$, then $$\nn^2-3n+2=(n-1)(n-2)\n$$is the product of two integers greater than 1, and thus is not prime. For $n=1$, $2$, and $3$ we have, respectively, $$\n(1-1)(1-2) = 0,\\quad (2-1)(2-2) = 0,\\quad\\text{and}\\quad (3-1)(3-2) = 2.\n$$Therefore, $n^2-3n+2$ is prime only when $n=3$, for a total of $\\boxed{1}$ positive integer $n$."
