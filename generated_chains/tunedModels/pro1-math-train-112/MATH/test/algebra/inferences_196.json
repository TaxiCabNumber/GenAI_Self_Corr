At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circle of radius 5 with its center at $(0,0)$ is drawn on a Cartesian coordinate system. How many lattice points (points with integer coordinates) lie within or on this circle?",
        "inference": "The circle is given by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. The lattice points within or on the circle are those points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation and have integer coordinates.\n\nWe can solve this equation for $y$ to get $y = \\pm\\sqrt{25 - x^2}$. The lattice points within or on the circle are those points $(x, y)$ that satisfy this equation and have integer coordinates.\n\nFor each integer $x$ between $-5$ and $5$, there are two possible integer values of $y$, one positive and one negative. So there are $2 \\times 11 = 22$ lattice points within or on the circle.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{22}. I hope it is correct.",
