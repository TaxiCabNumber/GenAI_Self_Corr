At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular patio has an area of $180$ square feet and a perimeter of $54$ feet. What is the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the length and $y$ be the width of the patio.\n\nArea of the patio: $xy = 180$\n\nPerimeter of the patio: $2x + 2y = 54$\n\nSolving for $y$ in the second equation: $y = 27 - x$\n\nSubstituting $y$ into the first equation: $x(27 - x) = 180$\n\nExpanding and simplifying: $27x - x^2 = 180$\n\nRearranging: $x^2 - 27x + 180 = 0$\n\nFactoring: $(x - 12)(x - 15) = 0$\n\nTherefore, $x = 12$ or $x = 15$.\n\nSince the patio is a rectangle, the length and width must be different. Therefore, $x = 15$ and $y = 12$.\n\nThe diagonal of the patio is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $x$ and $y$.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem: $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$\n\nSubstituting $x = 15$ and $y = 12$: $d^2 = 15^2 + 12^2$\n\nEvaluating: $d^2 = 225 + 144$\n\nSimplifying: $d^2 = 369$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{369}$.

        "ground_truth": "Set one side of the patio equal to $a$ and the other equal to $b$, producing two equations: \\begin{align*}\nab&=180,\\text{ and}\\\\\n2a+2b&=54.\n\\end{align*}The second equation can be rewritten as $b=27-a$. Substituting, we have \\begin{align*}\n180&=a\\left(27-a\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n180&=27a-a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-180&=a^2-27a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=a^2-27a+180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=\\left(a-12\\right)\\left(a-15\\right).\n\\end{align*}So $12$ feet and $15$ feet are the lengths of the two sides of the patio. Therefore, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{12^2+15^2}$, or $\\sqrt{369}$. Therefore, the length of the diagonal squared is $\\boxed{369}$."
