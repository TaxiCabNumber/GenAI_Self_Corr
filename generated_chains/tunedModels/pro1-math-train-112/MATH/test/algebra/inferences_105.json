        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTogether, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of apples Betty has as \"b\".\nSince Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, the number of apples Amy has is \"3b\".\nTogether, Amy and Betty have 20 apples, so we can write an equation:\nb + 3b = 20\nCombining like terms, we get:\n4b = 20\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\nb = 5\nTherefore, Betty has 5 apples.\nAmy has three times the number of apples that Betty has, so Amy has 3b = 3(5) = 15 apples.\nThe difference between the number of apples Amy has and the number of apples Betty has is 15 - 5 = 10.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty."
