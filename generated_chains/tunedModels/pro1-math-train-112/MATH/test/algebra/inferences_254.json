At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAngie decided to use her class as a sample to predict the total number of students in her school wearing red on Valentine's Day. She counted 11 students wearing red in her class of 24 students. Using this ratio, how many of the 480 students in her school will she estimate are wearing red?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the ratio of students wearing red to the total number of students in Angie's class.\n\nRatio = Number of students wearing red / Total number of students\nRatio = 11 / 24\nRatio = 11:24\n\n**Step 2:** Use the ratio to estimate the number of students wearing red in the entire school.\n\nNumber of students wearing red in school = Ratio * Total number of students in school\nNumber of students wearing red in school = (11:24) * 480\nNumber of students wearing red in school = 11/24 * 480\nNumber of students wearing red in school = 220\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$220$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can use the given information to set up a ratio and solve for the number of kids in the school that are wearing red.  Let $x$ equal the total number of students wearing red in the school.  From the given information, we have$$\\frac{11}{24}=\\frac{x}{480},$$so  $$x=\\frac{480\\cdot 11}{24},$$which means $$x=20\\cdot 11=\\boxed{220}.$$"
