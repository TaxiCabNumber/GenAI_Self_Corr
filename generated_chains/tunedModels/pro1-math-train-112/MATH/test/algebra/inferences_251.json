At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLines $y=(3a+2)x-2$ and $2y=(a-4)x+2$ are parallel. What is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Since the lines are parallel, their slopes are equal.\n\nThe slope of the first line is $3a+2$.\n\nThe slope of the second line is $\\frac{a-4}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n$$3a+2=\\frac{a-4}{2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$$6a+4=a-4$$\n\nSubtracting $a$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$5a+4=-4$$\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$5a=-8$$\n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n$$a=-\\frac{8}{5}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We find the slopes of the two lines and set them equal to each other, since parallel lines have the same slope. This gives $3a+2=\\frac{a}{2}-2$, which implies $a=\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$."
