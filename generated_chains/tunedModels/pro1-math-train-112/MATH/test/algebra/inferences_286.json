At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job?",
        "inference": "Let $N$ be the charge for coming out to the house and $x$ be the charge per hour.\n\nFor a one-hour repair job, the total charge is $N + x$. Since the charge is $97, we have:\n\n$$N + x = 97$$\n\nFor a five-hour repair job, the total charge is $N + 5x$. Since the charge is $265, we have:\n\n$$N + 5x = 265$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$$4x = 168$$\n\nDividing both sides by $4$, we get:\n\n$$x = 42$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 42$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$N + 42 = 97$$\n\nSubtracting $42$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$N = 55$$\n\nTherefore, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = \\boxed{149}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{149}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nN+x &= 97\\\\\nN+5x &= 265\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \\begin{align*}\n4x &= 265-97=168\\\\\nx &= 42.\n\\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \\$ 55+2\\cdot \\$ 42 = \\boxed{\\$ 139}$."
