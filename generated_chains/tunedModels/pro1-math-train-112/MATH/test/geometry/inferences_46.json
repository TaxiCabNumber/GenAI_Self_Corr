Point A is 3 inches from the fold, as shown. As the card is opened to an angle of 45 degrees, through how many more inches than point A does point B travel? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.

As the card is opened to an angle of 45 degrees, point B travels an arc of length $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 10=5\\pi$ inches.  Point A travels an arc of length $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 3=3\\pi$ inches.  Therefore, point B travels $5\\pi-3\\pi=2\\pi$ inches more than point A.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Point A is traveling along the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 6 inches. This circumference is $6\\pi$ inches.  Point B is traveling along the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 12 inches. This circumference is $12\\pi$ inches. Both points travel 45 degrees, which is $45 \\div 360 = 1/8$ of the circles' circumferences. The difference is then $(1/8)(12\\pi) - (1/8)(6\\pi) = (1/8)(12\\pi - 6\\pi) = (1/8)(6\\pi) = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}\\pi\\text{ inches}}$."
