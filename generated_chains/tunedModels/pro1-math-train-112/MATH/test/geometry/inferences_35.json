        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe volume of a square-based pyramid is given by $V=\\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.

Therefore, the volume of the pyramid can be written as $V=\\frac{1}{3}s^2h$.\n\nWe are given that the volume of the pyramid is 63,960 cubic meters and the height is 30 meters.
