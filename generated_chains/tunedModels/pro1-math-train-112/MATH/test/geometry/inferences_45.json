At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA water tank in the shape of a right circular cylinder has a base radius of $30$ meters and a volume of $2700\\pi$ cubic meters. What is the number of meters in the height of the tank?",
        "inference": "The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius of the base, and $h$ is the height.\n\nWe are given that the volume of the tank is $2700\\pi$ cubic meters and the radius of the base is $30$ meters. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$2700 = 900h$$\n\nDividing both sides by $900$, we get:\n\n$$h = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the height of the tank is $3$ meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters."
