        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a triangle are each $8$ units long. If the third side has a whole number length, what is the greatest possible perimeter, in units, for the triangle?",
        "inference": "The third side must be greater than $0$ and less than $16$ (the sum of the other two sides). The only whole number lengths that satisfy this condition are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15$. The greatest possible perimeter is obtained when the third side is $15$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$31$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The Triangle Inequality says that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. That means $8+8=16$ must be greater than the length of the third side. The third side has a whole number length, so the greatest possible length is 15 units. That makes the perimeter $8+8+15=\\boxed{31}$ units."
