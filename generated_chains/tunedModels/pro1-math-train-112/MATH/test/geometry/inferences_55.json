At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA star-polygon is drawn on a clock face by drawing a chord from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise from that number.  That is, chords are drawn from 12 to 5, from 5 to 10, from 10 to 3, and so on, ending back at 12.  What is the degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon?",
        "inference": "The star-polygon has 12 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is (12 - 2) * 180 = 1800 degrees.  Since there are 12 vertices, each vertex has an angle of 1800 / 12 = 150 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{150}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consider the two chords with an endpoint at 5. The arc subtended by the angle determined by these chords extends from 10 to 12, so the degree measure of the arc is $(2/12)(360)=60$.  By the Central Angle Theorem, the degree measure of this angle is $(1/2)(60)=30$. By symmetry, the degree measure of the angle at each vertex is $\\boxed{30}$."
