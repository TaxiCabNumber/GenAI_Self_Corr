At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A(2,2)$ and $B(7,7)$ be points in the plane. Define $R$ as the region in the first quadrant consisting of those points $C$ such that $\\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle. What is the area of the region $R$?",
        "inference": "The area of the region $R$ is the area of the triangle $ABC$. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, and the height is the distance from point $C$ to the line $AB$.\n\nThe distance between points $A$ and $B$ is $\\sqrt{(7-2)^2+(7-2)^2} = \\sqrt{25+25} = \\sqrt{50} = 5\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance from point $C$ to the line $AB$ is the length of the perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$. The equation of the line $AB$ is $y = x - 5$, so the slope of the line is $1$. The slope of the perpendicular to the line $AB$ is $-1$, so the equation of the perpendicular is $y = -x + b$.\n\nTo find the value of $b$, we substitute the coordinates of point $C$ into the equation of the perpendicular:\n\n$$7 = -2 + b$$\n\n$$b = 9$$\n\nSo the equation of the perpendicular is $y = -x + 9$.\n\nThe perpendicular intersects the line $AB$ at the point $(5,0)$. The distance from point $C$ to the line $AB$ is the distance between points $C$ and $(5,0)$, which is $\\sqrt{(5-2)^2+(0-7)^2} = \\sqrt{9+49} = \\sqrt{58} = 2\\sqrt{29}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle $ABC$ is $A = \\frac{1}{2}(5\\sqrt{2})(2\\sqrt{29}) = 5\\sqrt{58} = 10\\sqrt{14.5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10\\sqrt{14.5}}$.
