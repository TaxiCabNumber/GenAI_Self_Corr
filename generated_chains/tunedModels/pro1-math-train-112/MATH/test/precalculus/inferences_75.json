Let $p$ be the probability that the numbers $\\sin^2 x$, $\\cos^2 x$, and $\\sin x \\cos x$ are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

This is equivalent to $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x \\cos^2 x = 1$, which is true for all $x$.  Therefore, $p=0$, and $d=0$.  Thus, $m+n=0$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
