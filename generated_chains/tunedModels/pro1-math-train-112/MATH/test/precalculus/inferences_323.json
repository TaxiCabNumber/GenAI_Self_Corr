        "inference": "The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term, respectively, in the equation of the parabola.\n\nIn this case, the equation of the parabola is $y = 2t - 1$, so $a = 2$ and $b = 0$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\\frac{0}{2(2)} = 0$.\n\nTo find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute $x = 0$ into the equation of the parabola: $y = 2(0) - 1 = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the vertex of the parabola is $(0, -1)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(0, -1)}$.
