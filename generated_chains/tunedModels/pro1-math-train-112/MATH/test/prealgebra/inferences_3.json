        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a regular heptagon is $5\\cdot180^\\circ=900^\\circ$.  Since the heptagon shares a side with the square, the sum of the interior angles of the heptagon and the square is $900^\\circ+360^\\circ=1260^\\circ$.  Since the sum of the interior angles of a square is $360^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of the heptagon that do not share a side with the square is $1260^\\circ-360^\\circ=900^\\circ$.
