At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded in half to form a rectangle. If the resulting rectangle has a perimeter of 18 inches, what is the area of the original square, in square inches?",
        "inference": "Let's call the length of one side of the square x.\n\nWhen the square is folded in half, it forms a rectangle with a length of x and a width of x/2.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 18 inches, so we can write an equation:\n\n2x + 2(x/2) = 18\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2x + x = 18\n\n3x = 18\n\nx = 6\n\nSo the length of one side of the square is 6 inches.\n\nThe area of the square is:\n\nA = x^2\n\nA = 6^2\n\nA = 36\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{36}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square. The rectangle has sides of length $s$ and $s/2$, and its perimeter is $3s = 18$. It follows that $s = 6$, so the area of the original square is $\\boxed{36}$."
