At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of losses to wins for Kyle's team is 3 to 2. If the team had played the same number of games, but had won twice as many of its games, what would the ratio of losses to wins have been? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
