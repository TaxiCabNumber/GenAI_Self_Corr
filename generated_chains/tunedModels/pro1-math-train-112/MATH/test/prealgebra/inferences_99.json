At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two pints in one quart and four quarts in one gallon. How many pints are there in $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons of milk?",
        "inference": "1 pint = 1/2 quart\n1 quart = 1/4 gallon\nSo, 1 pint = 1/8 gallon\nTherefore, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons of milk = $2\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 = 20$ pints\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are two pints in each quart and four quarts in a gallon, there are $2\\times4=8$ pints in each gallon.  Multiplying 8 by $2\\frac{1}{2}$, we find that there are $\\boxed{20}$ pints in $2\\frac{1}{2}$ gallons."
