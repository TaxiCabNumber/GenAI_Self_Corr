At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square quilt block shown is used in a larger quilt. The four small squares in the block are congruent, and the four small vertical rectangles in the block that are not squares are also congruent. The total area of the shaded regions is what fraction of the total area of the block? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nfill((-10,0)--(-5,0)--(-5,5)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((-5,5)--(-5,10)--(0,10)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((0,0)--(0,10)--(10,10)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((0,0)--(-10,-10)--(0,-10)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((0,-10)--(5,-10)--(5,-5)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((5,-5)--(5,0)--(10,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((10,10)--(10,-10)--(-10,-10)--(-10,10)--cycle);\ndraw((-10,-10)--(10,10));\ndraw((0,10)--(0,-10));\ndraw((10,0)--(-10,0));\ndraw((-5,0)--(-5,10));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,-10));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the four small squares and the four small vertical rectangles. The area of each small square is 5^2 = 25 square units. The area of each small vertical rectangle is 5 * 10 = 50 square units. Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is 4 * 25 + 4 * 50 = 100 + 200 = 300 square units. The total area of the block is 10 * 10 = 100 square units. Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is 300 / 100 = 3/1.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3/1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose the whole block has area $1$.  Each of the smaller squares then has area $1/4$.  Each big right triangle has area $(1/2)(1/4)=1/8$, while each small right triangle has area $(1/8)(1/4)=1/32$.  Thus the total shaded area, which equals the fraction covered, equals $4(1/32)+2(1/8)=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$."
