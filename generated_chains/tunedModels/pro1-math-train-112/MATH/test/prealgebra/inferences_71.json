At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRound $563.5097$ to the nearest hundredth.",

Since 0 is less than 5, we round down the hundredth place to 5.\n\nTherefore, $563.5097$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{563.51}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{563.51}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To round to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the thousandths place, which here is $9$.\n\n$9$ is greater than or equal to $5$, so the hundredths digit $0$ rounds up to $1$. So, rounding $563.5097$ to the nearest hundredth yields $\\boxed{563.51}.$"
