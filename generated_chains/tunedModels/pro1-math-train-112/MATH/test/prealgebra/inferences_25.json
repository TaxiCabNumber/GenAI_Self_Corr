        "inference": "The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula $P = 2(l + w)$, where $P$ is the perimeter, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.\n\nWe are given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 76 feet, so we can write the equation $76 = 2(3x + 10 + x + 12)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $76 = 2(4x + 22)$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $38 = 4x + 22$.\n\nSubtracting 22 from both sides, we get $16 = 4x$.\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $x = 4$.\n\nNow that we know the value of $x$, we can find the area of the rectangle using the formula $A = lw$, where $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.\n\nSubstituting the values of $l$ and $w$ into the formula, we get $A = (3x + 10)(x + 12)$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $A = (3(4) + 10)(4 + 12)$.\n\nEvaluating the expression, we get $A = (12 + 10)(16)$.\n\nMultiplying the two terms, we get $A = 22 \\cdot 16$.\n\nMultiplying the two numbers, we get $A = 352$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 352 square feet.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{352}.

        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions $l$ and $w$ is $2(l+w)$.  Setting $2(3x+10+x+12)$ equal to 76, we find $4x+22=38$, which implies $x=4$ feet.  The area of the rectangle is $(3x+10)(x+12)=(3(4)+10)(4+12)=\\boxed{352}$ square feet."
