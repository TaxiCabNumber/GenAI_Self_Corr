        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a regular pentagon is $540^\\circ$. Since the pentagon and hexagon share a side, the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon and the hexagon is $540^\\circ + 720^\\circ = 1260^\\circ$. The sum of the interior angles of the triangle $ABC$ is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, the degree measure of angle $BAC$ is $1260^\\circ - 180^\\circ = \\boxed{1080^\\circ}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1080^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The measure of each interior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $180(n-2)/n$ degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $\\angle BAD$ is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees and the measure of angle $CAD$ is 108 degrees.  Their difference, $\\angle BAC$, measures $120-108=\\boxed{12\\text{ degrees}}$."
