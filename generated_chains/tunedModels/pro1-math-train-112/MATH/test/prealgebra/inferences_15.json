At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDave's sister baked $3$ dozen pies of which a third contained chocolate, a quarter contained marshmallows, a sixth contained cayenne, and one twelfth contained salted soy nuts.  What is the smallest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of pies that contained chocolate: $3 \\times 1/3 = 1$ dozen = $12$ pies.\n2. Find the number of pies that contained marshmallows: $3 \\times 1/4 = 3/4$ dozen = $9$ pies.\n3. Find the number of pies that contained cayenne: $3 \\times 1/6 = 1/2$ dozen = $6$ pies.\n4. Find the number of pies that contained salted soy nuts: $3 \\times 1/12 = 1/4$ dozen = $3$ pies.\n5. Add the number of pies that contained each ingredient: $12 + 9 + 6 + 3 = 30$ pies.\n6. Subtract the number of pies that contained any ingredient from the total number of pies: $36 - 30 = 6$ pies.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",

If she does this, then  \\[12+9+6+3=30\\] of the pies will have one of these ingredients.  The other 6 pies will have none of these ingredients.
