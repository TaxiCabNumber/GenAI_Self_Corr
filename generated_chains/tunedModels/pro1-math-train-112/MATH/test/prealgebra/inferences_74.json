At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain number is multiplied by five, the result is the  same as twenty-one plus twice the original number.  What is the value of the original number?",
        "inference": "Let the original number be x.\nAccording to the given information, we have:\n5x = 21 + 2x\n5x - 2x = 21\n3x = 21\nx = 21/3\nx = 7\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $5x=2x+21$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $3x=21$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives $x=\\boxed{7}$."
