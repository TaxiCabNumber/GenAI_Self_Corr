At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe radius of a circle is $x+6$ and its diameter is $3x+5$. What is the circumference of the circle, in terms of $\\pi$? (Do not include the variable $x$ in your answer.)",
        "inference": "The diameter of a circle is twice the radius. So, $2(x+6)=3x+5$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=7$. The circumference of a circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. So, the circumference of the circle is $2\\pi(x+6)=2\\pi(7+6)=2\\pi(13)=26\\pi$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$26\\pi$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the diameter of a circle is twice its radius, we know that $3x+5=2(x+6)$, or $3x+5=2x+12$. Subtracting $2x+5$ from both sides gives $x=7$. The circumference of a circle is $\\pi$ times its diameter, so the circumference is $(3x+5)\\pi=(3\\cdot7+5)\\pi=(21+5)\\pi=\\boxed{26\\pi}$."
