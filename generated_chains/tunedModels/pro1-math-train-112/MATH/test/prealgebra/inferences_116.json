        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA girls' track team must run 3 miles on the first day of practice and 6 miles every day after that. The boys' team must run 5 miles every day of practice. The coach will order new javelins at the end of the day that each girl's total mileage surpasses each boy's. How many total miles will each girl have run by the time the coach orders the new equipment?",
        "inference": "The girls run 3 miles on the first day and 6 miles each day after that. So, the total number of miles they will have run by the time the coach orders the new equipment is 3 + 6(n-1), where n is the number of days after the first day that the coach orders the new equipment.\n\nThe boys run 5 miles every day of practice. So, the total number of miles they will have run by the time the coach orders the new equipment is 5n, where n is the number of days of practice.\n\nThe coach will order new javelins at the end of the day that each girl's total mileage surpasses each boy's. So, we need to find the value of n that makes 3 + 6(n-1) > 5n.\n\n3 + 6(n-1) > 5n\n3 + 6n - 6 > 5n\n6n - 3 > 5n\nn > 3\n\nSo, the coach will order new javelins at the end of the day that each girl's total mileage surpasses each boy's when n > 3. The smallest value of n that satisfies this inequality is n = 4. So, the girls will have run a total of 3 + 6(4-1) = 21 miles by the time the coach orders the new equipment.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{21}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ represent the number of days of practice. The number of miles run by each girl can be expressed as $3+6(d-1)$ and the number of miles run by each boy is $5d$. The girls will have outrun the boys after $d$ days if $3+6(d-1)>5d$. We solve this inequality as follows: \\begin{align*}\n3+6(d-1) &> 5d \\quad \\implies \\\\\n3+6d-6 &> 5d \\quad \\implies \\\\\n6d-5d &> 6-3 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nd &> 3.\n\\end{align*}So the girls will outrun the boys on the fourth day, and the number of miles they will have run is $3+6(4-1)=\\boxed{21}$ miles."
