At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.\n\nHow many handshakes are there in total?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of handshakes between each member of a team and the opposing teams.\n\nEach member of a team shakes hands with 3 members of each of the other two teams, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 handshakes per member.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of handshakes between members of the same team.\n\nEach member of a team shakes hands with 3 other members of their own team, for a total of 3 handshakes per member.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of handshakes per member by the total number of members.\n\nThere are 4 members per team and 3 teams, for a total of 4 * 3 = 12 members.\n\n**Step 4:** Add the number of handshakes between opposing teams and the number of handshakes within teams.\n\nTotal handshakes = (6 handshakes per member * 12 members) + (3 handshakes per member * 12 members)\n= 72 handshakes + 36 handshakes\n= 108 handshakes\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$108$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.\n\nThere are 12 players in total, which offers $12\\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\dfrac{324}{2}=\\boxed{162}$ handshakes."
