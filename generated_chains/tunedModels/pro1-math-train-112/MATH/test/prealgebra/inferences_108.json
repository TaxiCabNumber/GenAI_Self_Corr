At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit positive integers are there?",
        "inference": "There are 9 choices for the first digit (1-9), 10 choices for the second digit (0-9), and 10 choices for the third digit (0-9).\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit positive integers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{900}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are trying to count the number of numbers in the sequence $100, 101, 102, \\ldots , 998, 999$. If we subtract 99 from every term in the sequence it becomes $1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 899, 900$. So, there are $\\boxed{900}$ positive integers with 3 digits."
