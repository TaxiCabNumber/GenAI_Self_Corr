At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of dogs to cats at the pound is $4:3$. How many dogs were at the pound if a total of 280 dogs and cats were at the pound?",
        "inference": "Let $d$ be the number of dogs and $c$ be the number of cats.\n\nWe have the ratio $\\frac{d}{c}=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nWe also know that $d+c=280$.\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get $\\frac{4}{3}c+c=280$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $\\frac{7}{3}c=280$.\n\nSolving for $c$, we get $c=120$.\n\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we get $d=\\frac{4}{3}c=\\frac{4}{3}(120)=160$.\n\nTherefore, there were $\\boxed{160}$ dogs at the pound.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{160}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $4x$ be the number of dogs and $3x$ be the number of cats. Then $4x + 3x = 280$, or $7x = 280$. Solving, we get $x = 40$. Thus, the number of dogs is $4x = 4(40) = \\boxed{160}$."
