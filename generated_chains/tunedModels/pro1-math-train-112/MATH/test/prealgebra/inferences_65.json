I hope it is correct.'\nA hot air balloon is 10 feet off the ground and is rising at a constant rate of 2 feet per second. What is the height of the balloon, in feet, after 25 more seconds?",
        "inference": "The height of the balloon after 25 seconds is the initial height plus the distance traveled in 25 seconds.\n\nDistance traveled = rate \u00d7 time = 2 feet/second \u00d7 25 seconds = 50 feet\n\nHeight after 25 seconds = initial height + distance traveled = 10 feet + 50 feet = 60 feet\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "During these 25 seconds, the balloon will rise $2\\cdot25=50$ feet. The total height is then $10+50=\\boxed{60}$ feet."
