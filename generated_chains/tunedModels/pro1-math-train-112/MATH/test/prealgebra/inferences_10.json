At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJavier is biking at 15 miles per hour. There are 5280 feet in a mile. How many feet does he travel in one minute?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 15 miles per hour to feet per minute:\n15 miles per hour * (5280 feet per mile) * (1 hour per 60 minutes) = 220 feet per minute\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{220}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 15 miles per hour is 1/4 mile per minute, Javier travels $(5280)(1/4) = \\boxed{1320}$ feet in one minute."
