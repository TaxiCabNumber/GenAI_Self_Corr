        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?",
        "inference": "2250 degrees is equivalent to 6 full rotations (360 degrees each) and an additional 30 degrees.\n\nSince she spins to her right, each full rotation brings her 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nAfter 6 full rotations, she has turned 540 degrees clockwise, which brings her back to facing north.\n\nThe additional 30 degrees clockwise brings her to facing northeast.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{northeast}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$."
