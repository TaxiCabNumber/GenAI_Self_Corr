        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary completes a 15-mile race in 2.5 hours. What is her average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the time to hours: 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes\n2. Calculate the average speed: Average speed = Distance / Time = 15 miles / 150 minutes = 0.1 miles per minute\n3. Convert the average speed to miles per hour: Average speed = 0.1 miles per minute * 60 minutes per hour = 6 miles per hour\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is total distance divided by time.  In this case, we divide 15 miles by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ hours to find an average speed of $15\\div \\frac{5}{2}=15\\cdot \\frac{2}{5}=\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour."
