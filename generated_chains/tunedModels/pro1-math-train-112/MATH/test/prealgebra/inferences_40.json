At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is a face card (a Jack, Queen, or King)?",
        "inference": "There are 12 face cards in a deck of 52 cards.  The probability of drawing a face card is $\\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{3}{13}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{13}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $3 \\times 4 = 12$ face cards and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a face card is $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{13}}$."
