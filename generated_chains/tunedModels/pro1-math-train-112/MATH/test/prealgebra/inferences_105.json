At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA whole number larger than 2 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by each of the numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6.  What is the smallest such number?",
        "inference": "The smallest number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, 4, 5, and 6 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, and 6 plus 2.\n\nThe prime factorization of 3 is 3.\nThe prime factorization of 4 is 2^2.\nThe prime factorization of 5 is 5.\nThe prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3.\n\nThe LCM of 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 2^2 * 3 * 5 = 60.\n\nThe smallest number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60 + 2 = 62.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{62}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 and 5 are 22, 42, 62, and so on.  Checking these numbers for a remainder of 2 when divided by both 3 and 6 yields $\\boxed{62}$ as the smallest.\n\nWe also might have noted that the desired number is 2 greater than a number that is a multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Therefore, it is 2 greater than the least common multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The least common multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6 is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5 = 60$, so the smallest number that fits the problem is $60 + 2 = \\boxed{62}$."
