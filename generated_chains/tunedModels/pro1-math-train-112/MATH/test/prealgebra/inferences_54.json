At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible area, in square centimeters, of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the height.\n\nIn this case, the base is 12 cm and the height is 20 cm. So, the area is $A = \\frac{1}{2}(12)(20) = 120$ cm\u00b2.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.\n\nIf the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.\n\nThe largest possible area then is $\\boxed{120}$ square centimeters."
