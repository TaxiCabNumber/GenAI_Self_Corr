        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe sum of the interior angles of an equilateral triangle is $180^\\circ$. Since there are three interior angles, each interior angle measures $\\frac{180^\\circ}{3}=60^\\circ$.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a square is $360^\\circ$. Since there are four interior angles, each interior angle measures $\\frac{360^\\circ}{4}=90^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square is $\\frac{60^\\circ}{90^\\circ}=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.
