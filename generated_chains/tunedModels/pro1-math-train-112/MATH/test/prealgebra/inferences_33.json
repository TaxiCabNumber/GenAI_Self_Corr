At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 5 units and a leg of length 3 units. How many square units is the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$$\n\nwhere b is the length of the base and h is the length of the height.\n\nIn this case, the base is the leg of length 3 units and the height is the other leg, which we don't know. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height:\n\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n\nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n$$3^2 + h^2 = 5^2$$\n\n$$9 + h^2 = 25$$\n\n$$h^2 = 16$$\n\n$$h = 4$$\n\nNow we can calculate the area of the triangle:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}bh = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}.
