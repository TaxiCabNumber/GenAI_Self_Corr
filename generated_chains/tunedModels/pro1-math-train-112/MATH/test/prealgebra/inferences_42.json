        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 2 inch by 2 inch square has its area increased by 21 square inches producing a new square. How many inches long is a side of the new square?",
        "inference": "The area of the original square is 2 * 2 = 4 square inches.\n\nThe area of the new square is 4 + 21 = 25 square inches.\n\nThe side length of the new square is the square root of 25, which is 5 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the old square is $2\\cdot2=4$ square inches. The new area is $4+21=25$ square inches. So each side of the new square measures $\\sqrt{25}=\\boxed{5}$ inches."
