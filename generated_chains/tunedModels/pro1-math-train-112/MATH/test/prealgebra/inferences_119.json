At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA trapezoid has one base equal to its height, $x$, and the other base is twice as long. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of $x$.",
        "inference": "The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$$\n\nwhere $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases.\n\nIn this case, the height is $x$ and one base is $x$, so the other base is $2x$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}x(x + 2x)$$\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}x(3x)$$\n\n$$A = \\frac{3}{2}x^2$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{2}x^2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the length of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $x$ and $2x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{x+2x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{3x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\frac{3x^2}{2}}$."
