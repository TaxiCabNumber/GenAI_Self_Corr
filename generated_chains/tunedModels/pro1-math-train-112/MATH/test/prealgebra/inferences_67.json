At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a world record, George Adrian picked 15,832 pounds of apples in 8 hours. Assuming he maintained a constant rate of picking, how many pounds of apples did he pick in 3 hours?",
        "inference": "1) Find the rate of picking apples per hour:\nRate = Total apples picked / Total hours taken\nRate = 15,832 pounds / 8 hours\nRate = 1,979 pounds per hour\n\n2) Calculate the number of apples picked in 3 hours:\nApples picked in 3 hours = Rate * 3 hours\nApples picked in 3 hours = 1,979 pounds per hour * 3 hours\nApples picked in 3 hours = 5,937 pounds\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5,937}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many hours, George picks $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many pounds of apples.  Therefore, George picked $\\frac{3}{8}(15,\\!832)=\\frac{3}{8}(16,\\!000-168)=3(2000)-3(21)=\\boxed{5937}$ pounds of apples in 3 hours."
