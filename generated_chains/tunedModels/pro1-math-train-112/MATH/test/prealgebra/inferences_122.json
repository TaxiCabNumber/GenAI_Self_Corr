        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ambulance travels at 40 mph and can follow a 20-mile route making no stops to get to the hospital. A helicopter travels at one mile per minute, and the air route is 15 miles to get to the same hospital. However, the helicopter takes three minutes for takeoff and three minutes for landing. How many fewer minutes does it take for the helicopter to complete its trip (takeoff, flight and landing) than for the ambulance to complete its trip?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the helicopter's speed to miles per hour.\n1 mile per minute = 60 miles per hour\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the time it takes for the helicopter to fly the 15-mile route.\n15 miles / 60 miles per hour = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes\n\n**Step 3:** Add the takeoff and landing time to the flight time.\n15 minutes + 3 minutes + 3 minutes = 21 minutes\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the time it takes for the ambulance to travel the 20-mile route.\n20 miles / 40 miles per hour = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes\n\n**Step 5:** Subtract the helicopter's time from the ambulance's time.\n30 minutes - 21 minutes = 9 minutes\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the ambulance travels at 40 miles per hour and takes a 20 mile route to the hospital, it will take half an hour, or 30 minutes. The helicopter takes three minutes to take off, three minutes to land, and 15 minutes to travel to the hospital, for a total of 21 minutes. Therefore, it takes the helicopter $30 - 21 = \\boxed{9}$ fewer minutes to complete its trip."
