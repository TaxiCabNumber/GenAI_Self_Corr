At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the length of a rectangular room to its width is $5:3$. The perimeter of the room is 48 feet. What is the area of the room?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the room be $5x$ feet and the width be $3x$ feet.\n\nThe perimeter of the room is $2(5x + 3x) = 16x$ feet.\n\nSince the perimeter is 48 feet, we have $16x = 48$, so $x = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the room is $5x = 5(3) = 15$ feet and the width is $3x = 3(3) = 9$ feet.\n\nThe area of the room is $length \\times width = 15 \\times 9 = 135$ square feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the perimeter of the room is 48 feet, then the semiperimeter is half that or 24 feet. This is the sum of the length and the width. The  part-to-part ratio $5:3$ is a total of 8 parts, so each part must be worth $24 \\div 8 = 3$ feet. That means the length is $5 \\times 3 = 15$ feet and the width is  $3 \\times 3 = 9$ feet, so the area must be $15 \\times 9 = \\boxed{135\\text{ square feet}}$."
