At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ordinary $6$-sided die has a number on each face from $1$ to $6$ (each number appears on one face). How many ways can I paint two faces of a die blue, so that the product of the numbers on the painted faces isn't equal to $6$?",
        "inference": "There are $6$ faces on a die. We can paint any two of them blue. So, there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ ways to paint two faces blue.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of ways in which the product of the numbers on the painted faces is equal to $6$. There are $3$ such ways: $(1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2)$.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to paint two faces blue so that the product of the numbers on the painted faces isn't equal to $6$ is $30 - 3 = \\boxed{27}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, let's ignore the requirement that the product can't be $6$. Then I can pick the first blue face in $6$ ways, and the second blue face in $5$ ways, making $6\\cdot 5 = 30$ choices in all. But we've actually counted each possible result twice, because it makes no difference which of the two blue faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the number of different pairs of faces is really $(6\\cdot 5)/2$, or $15$.\n\nNow we exclude the pairs which have a product of $6$. There are two such pairs: $\\{1,6\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$. That leaves me $\\boxed{13}$ pairs of faces I can paint blue."
