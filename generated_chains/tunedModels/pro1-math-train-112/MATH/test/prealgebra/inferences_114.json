At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFifty students were surveyed about their participation in hockey and baseball. The results of the survey were:\n\n$\\bullet$ $33$ students played hockey\n\n$\\bullet$ $24$ students played baseball\n\n$\\bullet$ $8$ students played neither hockey nor baseball\n\nHow many of the students surveyed played both hockey and baseball?",
        "inference": "Let $H$ be the set of students who played hockey and $B$ be the set of students who played baseball. Then, we have:\n\n$$n(H) = 33$$\n\n$$n(B) = 24$$\n\n$$n(H \\cap B) = ?$$\n\nWe know that $n(H \\cup B) = n(H) + n(B) - n(H \\cap B)$. We also know that $n(H \\cup B) = 50 - 8 = 42$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$42 = 33 + 24 - n(H \\cap B)$$\n\n$$n(H \\cap B) = 33 + 24 - 42 = 15$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there were $50$ students surveyed in total and $8$ played neither hockey nor baseball, then $42$ students in total played one game or the other.\n\nSince $33$ students played hockey and $24$ students played baseball, and this totals $33+24=57$ students, then there must be $\\boxed{15}$ students who are \"double-counted\", that is who play both sports."
