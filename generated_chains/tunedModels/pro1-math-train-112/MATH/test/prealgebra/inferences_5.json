At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive three-digit integer $N$ has a ones digit of $0$. What is the probability that $N$ is divisible by $4$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The number $N$ is divisible by $4$ if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by $4$. Since the last digit of $N$ is $0$, the number formed by its last two digits is $10$. Therefore, $N$ is divisible by $4$ if and only if $10$ is divisible by $4$. Since $10$ is divisible by $4$, the probability that $N$ is divisible by $4$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An integer is divisible by 4 if and only if a number formed from the last two digits is divisible by 4. If the units digit is 0, all the numbers with even tens digits are divisible by 4 (00, 20, 40, 60, 80), and all the numbers with odd tens digits are not (10, 30, 50, 70, 90). Since there are the same number of even digits as odd digits, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that $N$ is divisible by 4."
