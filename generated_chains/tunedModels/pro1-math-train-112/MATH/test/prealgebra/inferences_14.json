At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a 12-hour analog clock reads 8:00, what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands?",
        "inference": "The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves 30 degrees per hour. At 8:00, the hour hand has moved 8 hours, so it has moved 8 * 30 = 240 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute. At 8:00, the minute hand has moved 0 minutes, so it has moved 0 * 6 = 0 degrees.\n\nThe smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands is the difference between the two angles, so it is 240 - 0 = 240 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{240}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
