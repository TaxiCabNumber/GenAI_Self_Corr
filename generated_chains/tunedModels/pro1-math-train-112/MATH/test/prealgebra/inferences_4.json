At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA housefly sits on the outer edge of a rotating circular ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet. The fan rotates constantly at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. How many minutes had the housefly been on the fan during the time it took to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the fan's speed from revolutions per minute to radians per second.\n\n20 revolutions per minute = 20 * 2\u03c0 radians per minute = (20 * 2\u03c0) / 60 radians per second = 2\u03c0/3 radians per second\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the distance traveled by the housefly in one second.\n\nDistance = Radius * Angular speed = 3 feet * 2\u03c0/3 radians per second = 2\u03c0 feet per second\n\n**Step 3:** Divide the total distance traveled by the distance traveled in one second to find the time taken.\n\nTime = Total distance / Distance per second = 19,404\u03c0 feet / 2\u03c0 feet per second = 9,702 seconds\n\n**Step 4:** Convert the time from seconds to minutes.\n\nTime = 9,702 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 161.7 minutes\n\n**Step 5:** Round the time to the nearest whole number.\n\nTime = 162 minutes\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{162}.
