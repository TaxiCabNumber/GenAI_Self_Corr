At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n$$n = \\frac{48 - (-36)}{7} + 1 = \\frac{84}{7} + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{13}. I hope it is correct.",
