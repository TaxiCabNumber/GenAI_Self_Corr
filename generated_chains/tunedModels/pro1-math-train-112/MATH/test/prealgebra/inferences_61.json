At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBlake and Jenny each took four 100-point tests.  Blake averaged 78 on the four tests.  Jenny scored 10 points higher than Blake on the first test, 10 points lower than him on the second test, and 20 points higher on both the third and fourth tests. What is the difference between Jenny's average and Blake's average on these four tests?",
