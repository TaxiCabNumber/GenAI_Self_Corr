At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
        "inference": "There are 5! ways to arrange the Democrats and 5! ways to arrange the Republicans.  Since the table is circular, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that the arrangements are indistinguishable if the table is rotated.  Therefore, the number of distinguishable ways to seat the committee members is:\n\n$$\\frac{5!5!}{2} = \\frac{120 \\cdot 120}{2} = 7200$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7200}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements."
