At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if we have no restrictions other than the same person can't hold both offices?",
