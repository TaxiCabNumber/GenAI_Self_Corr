At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

For example, $4 + 4 + 1$ and $1 + 4 + 4$ are two different ways.",

We have $9$ objects (the $1\\text{'s},$ $2\\text{'s},$ and $4\\text{'s}$) and $3$ types of objects (the $1\\text{'s},$ $2\\text{'s},$ and $4\\text{'s}$). So, we have $9 + 3 - 1 = 11$ stars and bars.
