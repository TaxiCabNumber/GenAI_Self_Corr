At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have more girls than boys?",
        "inference": "We can select 6 people from 14 people in $\\binom{14}{6}$ ways.\n\nWe can select 5 girls from 8 girls in $\\binom{8}{5}$ ways.\n\nWe can select 1 boy from 6 boys in $\\binom{6}{1}$ ways.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to select a team with more girls than boys is $\\binom{14}{6} \\times \\binom{8}{5} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 30030$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{30030}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We do this problem with three cases.\n\nCase 1: 4 girls, 2 boys on the team.\n\nWith 4 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick the boys, for a total of $70 \\times 15 = 1050$.\n\nCase 2: 5 girls, 1 boy on the team.  With 5 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{5} = 56$ ways to pick the girls, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to pick the boy, for a total of $56 \\times 6 = 336$.\n\nCase 3: 6 girls on the team. With 6 girls on the team, there are $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ ways to pick the girls on the team.\n\nThis gives us a sum of $1050 + 336 + 28 = \\boxed{1414}$."
