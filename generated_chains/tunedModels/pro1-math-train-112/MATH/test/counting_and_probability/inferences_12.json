At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they are not all the same color?",
        "inference": "There are 26 red cards and 26 black cards in a standard 52-card deck.  The probability of choosing a red card is 26/52 = 1/2.  The probability of choosing a black card is 26/52 = 1/2.  The probability of choosing three cards of the same color is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.  The probability of choosing three cards of different colors is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7/8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]"
