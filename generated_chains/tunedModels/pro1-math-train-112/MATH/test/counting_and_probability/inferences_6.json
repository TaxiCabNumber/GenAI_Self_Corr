        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Roman alphabet (26 letters, A through Z).  Each word in their language is 3 letters, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once.  How many 3-letter words are possible?",
        "inference": "There are 26 choices for the first letter, 26 choices for the second letter, and 25 choices for the third letter (since the third letter cannot be the same as the first letter).  Therefore, the number of possible 3-letter words is 26 * 26 * 25 = 16,900.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{16900}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $26^3$ possible words that can be formed. Of those words, $25^3$ have no A. Thus, our answer is $26^3 - 25^3 = \\boxed{1951}$."
