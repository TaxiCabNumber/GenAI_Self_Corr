        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can one write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that given any number in the row, all of its divisors (not including itself) appear to its left?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's start by placing 1 in the first position. Then, the only number that can be placed in the second position is 2, since 1 is its only divisor.\n\nNow, we have three numbers left: 3, 4, and 5. We can place them in any order, but we need to make sure that their divisors appear to their left.\n\n* If we place 3 in the third position, then 1 and 2 are its divisors and they appear to its left.\n* If we place 4 in the third position, then 1 and 2 are its divisors and they appear to its left.\n* If we place 5 in the third position, then 1 is its only divisor and it appears to its left.\n\nSo, we have three options for the third position.\n\nNow, we have two numbers left: 4 and 5. We can place them in any order, but we need to make sure that their divisors appear to their left.\n\n* If we place 4 in the fourth position, then 1 and 2 are its divisors and they appear to its left.\n* If we place 5 in the fourth position, then 1 is its only divisor and it appears to its left.\n\nSo, we have two options for the fourth position.\n\nFinally, we have one number left: 6. We can place it in the fifth position, and its only divisor (1) appears to its left.\n\nTherefore, there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{6}$ ways to write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that given any number in the row, all of its divisors (not including itself) appear to its left.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by finding all possible ways to arrange the 1, 2, 3, and 6.  There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\\boxed{25}$ orderings in all."
