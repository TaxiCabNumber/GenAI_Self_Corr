When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of obtaining face $F$. Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $1-p$.
