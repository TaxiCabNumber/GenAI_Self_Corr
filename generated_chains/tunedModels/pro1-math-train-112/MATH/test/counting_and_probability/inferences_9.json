In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?",

So there are $2! \\cdot 4!$ ways to stack the $6$ books with the math books next to each other.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the number of ways to stack the $6$ books with the math books next to each other from the number of ways to stack the $6$ books without any restrictions.\n\n$6! - 2! \\cdot 4! = 6! - 2 \\cdot 4! = 6! - 2 \\cdot 24 = 6! - 48 = 720 - 48 = 672$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$672$}.

Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books.
