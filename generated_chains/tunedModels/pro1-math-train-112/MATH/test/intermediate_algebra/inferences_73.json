At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a$ and $b$ be real numbers such that the quadratic equations $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ and $ax^2 + bx + 1 = 0$ have a root in common.  Enter all possible values of $a + b,$ separated by commas.",
        "inference": "The discriminant of the first equation is $a^2 - 4b$, and the discriminant of the second equation is $b^2 - 4a$.  Since the two equations have a root in common, their discriminants must be equal.  Therefore, $a^2 - 4b = b^2 - 4a$, which simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 = 4(a + b)$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are real, $a^2 + b^2 \\ge 0$, so $a + b \\ge 0$.  Also, since $a^2 + b^2 = 4(a + b)$, we have $a^2 + b^2 - 4(a + b) = 0$, which factors as $(a - 2)^2 + (b - 2)^2 = 0$.  Since the sum of two squares is zero only when both squares are zero, we have $a - 2 = 0$ and $b - 2 = 0$, so $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.  Therefore, the only possible value of $a + b$ is $2 + 2 = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
