        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than $2$. If $f(1) = 2$ and $f(2) = 3$, find the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)(x-2)$.",
        "inference": "By the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)(x-2)$ is equal to $f(1)f(2) = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $(x-1)(x-2)$ has degree $2$, we know the remainder has degree at most $1$, and thus is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Let $q(x)$ be the quotient. Then we have,\n$$f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)q(x)+ax+b.$$Substituting $x=1$ and $x=2$ gives us the equations:\n$$\\begin{aligned} f(1) &= 2 = a +b \\\\\nf(2) &= 3 = 2a+b \\end{aligned}$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $a=1$ and consequently, $b=1$. Hence the remainder is $\\boxed{x+1}$."
