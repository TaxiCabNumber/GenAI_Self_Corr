At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integers $m,$ $1 \\le m \\le 1000,$ does there exist at least one positive integer $n$ such that $m \\cdot n \\le m + n$?",
        "inference": "We can rewrite the inequality as $m \\cdot n - m \\le n$. Since $m$ is a positive integer, $m \\cdot n - m$ is also a positive integer. Therefore, $n$ must be a positive integer greater than or equal to $m \\cdot n - m$. The largest possible value of $m \\cdot n - m$ is $1000 \\cdot 1000 - 1000 = 999000$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $n$ is $999000$. The number of positive integers $m$ such that there exists at least one positive integer $n$ such that $m \\cdot n \\le m + n$ is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m \\cdot n - m \\le n$ for some positive integer $n$. This is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m \\cdot n - m \\le 999000$ for some positive integer $n$. This is the number of positive integers $m$ such that $m \\le 999000$.
