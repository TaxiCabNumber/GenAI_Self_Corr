To find the range of $g(x)$, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $g(x)$.\n\nThe minimum value of $g(x)$ occurs when the denominator is as large as possible and the numerator is as small as possible. The denominator is as large as possible when $x=-8$, and the numerator is as small as possible when $x=-1$.
