        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe can use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-a$ is equal to $f(a)$. So, to find the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$, we need to evaluate $f(x)$ at $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\n\n$$f(1) = 1^{10}+5(1)^9-8(1)^8+7(1)^7-1(1)^6-12(1)^5+4(1)^4-8(1)^3+12(1)^2-5(1)-5 = -5$$\n\n$$f(-1) = (-1)^{10}+5(-1)^9-8(-1)^8+7(-1)^7-(-1)^6-12(-1)^5+4(-1)^4-8(-1)^3+12(-1)^2-5(-1)-5 = -5$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$ is $\\boxed{-5}$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{-5}.

        "ground_truth": "We have\n$$f(x) = q(x)(x^2-1) + r(x),$$where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder. Since $x^2-1$ is quadratic, the remainder is at most linear; let us write $r(x) = ax+b$.\n\nObserve that $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are both zeroes of $x^2-1$. Thus $f(1)=r(1)$ and $f(-1)=r(-1)$.\n\nWe can use the given formula for $f(x)$ to compute $f(1)=-10$ and $f(-1)=16$. Thus we have the system of equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\n-10 = a\\cdot (1) + b,\\\\\n\\phantom{-}16 = a\\cdot (-1) + b.\n\\end{cases}$$Adding these equations yields $6=2b$ and hence $b=3$. Substituting into either equation then yields $a=-13$.\n\nTherefore, $r(x) = ax+b = \\boxed{-13x+3}$."
