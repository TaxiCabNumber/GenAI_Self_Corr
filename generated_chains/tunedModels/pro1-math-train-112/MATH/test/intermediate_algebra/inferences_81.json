        "ground_truth": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$."
