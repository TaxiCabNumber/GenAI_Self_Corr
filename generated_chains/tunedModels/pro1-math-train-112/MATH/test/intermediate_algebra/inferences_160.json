Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. **Holes:** The graph has a hole at $x=-1$ because the numerator and denominator have a common factor of $(x+1)$, but the numerator does not have a factor of $(x+1)^2$. Therefore, $a=1$.\n\n2. **Vertical Asymptotes:** The graph has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=1$ because the denominator is zero at these values. Therefore, $b=2$.\n\n3. **Horizontal Asymptotes:** The graph has no horizontal asymptotes because the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator. Therefore, $c=0$.\n\n4. **Oblique Asymptotes:** The graph has no oblique asymptotes because the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Therefore, $d=0$.\n\nTherefore, $a+2b+3c+4d=1+2(2)+3(0)+4(0)=\\boxed{5}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $$\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3} = \\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)}.$$In this representation we can immediately read that there is a hole at $x=-3$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors we have\n$$\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}.$$We can write $\\frac{x}{x+1}$ as $1 - \\frac{1}{x+1}$ which shows that as $x$ becomes very large, the graph tends towards $1$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+3+0 = \\boxed{6}.$"
