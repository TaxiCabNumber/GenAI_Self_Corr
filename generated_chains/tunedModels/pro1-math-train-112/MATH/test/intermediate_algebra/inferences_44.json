        "inference": "The graph of a rational function has a vertical asymptote at $x=a$ if the denominator is zero at $x=a$ but the numerator is not.\n\nSo, we need to find the value of $c$ such that $2x^2+7x-c=0$ has a root at $x=-5$.\n\nSubstituting $x=-5$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$$2(-5)^2+7(-5)-c=0$$\n\n$$50-35-c=0$$\n\n$$15=c$$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the vertical asymptote is $x=-5$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$x=-5$}.

So by the Factor theorem,\n$$2(-5)^2+7(-5)-c = 0$$which we can solve for $c$ to get $c = 15$.\nThen the denominator is $2x^2+7x-15$ which can be factored as $(2x-3)(x+5)$. Hence, the vertical asymptote is given by $\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}$."
