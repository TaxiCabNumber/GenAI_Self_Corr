At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBilly is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the time it takes to peel a potato to seconds: 1 minute and 30 seconds = 90 seconds\n2. Multiply the time it takes to peel a potato by the number of potatoes: 90 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds\n3. Add the time it takes to cut a potato to the time it takes to peel a potato: 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds\n4. Multiply the total time it takes to peel and cut a potato by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds\n5. Convert the total time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes\nI hope it is correct: 95 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.\nBilly only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.\nSo it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.\n#### 95"
