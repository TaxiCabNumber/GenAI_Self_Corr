At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the average time spent per patient from minutes to hours: 24 minutes = 24/60 = 0.4 hours.\n2. Calculate the total number of hours spent seeing patients per day: 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.\n3. Calculate the total amount charged by the doctors to the hospital: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.\n4. Calculate the total amount charged by the hospital to the patients: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.\n5. Calculate the profit made by the hospital: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.\nI hope it is correct: $10,000$",
        "ground_truth": "The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day\nThat means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day\nThey profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour\nSo they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits\n#### 10000"
