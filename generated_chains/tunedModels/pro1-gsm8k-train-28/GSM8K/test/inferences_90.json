He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult.  If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?",

Calculate the amount of potato salad the children will eat: 5 children x 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs\n3. Add the amount of potato salad the adults and children will eat: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs\nI hope it is correct: 225 $lbs$",
