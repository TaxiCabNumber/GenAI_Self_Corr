At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMorisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?",
        "inference": "1. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.\n2. Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which is 2 * 5 = 10 apples.\n3. Kael brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.\n4. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.\n5. The total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought is 13 + 14 = 27.\nI hope it is correct: 27",
        "ground_truth": "Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.\nAnd he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.\nTherefore, Kael and Morisette brought 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 fruits in total.\n#### 27"
