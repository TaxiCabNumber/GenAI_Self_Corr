At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIf Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?",
