At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?",

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.\n4. There are 360 pieces in the puzzle, so it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.\n5. 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1 hour",
