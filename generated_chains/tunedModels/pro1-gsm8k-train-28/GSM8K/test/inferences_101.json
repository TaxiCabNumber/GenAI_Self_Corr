Solo read 15 pages on Monday. If he has 4  more days to complete all his reading, how many pages does he need to read, on average, in one day?",

Subtract the number of pages Solo read on Monday from the total number of pages he has to read: 39 - 15 = 24 pages.\n3. Divide the remaining number of pages by the number of days Solo has left to complete his reading: 24 / 4 = 6 pages.\nI hope it is correct: 6 pages",
