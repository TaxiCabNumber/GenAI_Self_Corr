At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions cost $1.50. How much did the chef spend?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total weight of the onions: 4 bags x 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds\n2. Find the total cost of the onions: 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300\nI hope it is correct: $300$",
