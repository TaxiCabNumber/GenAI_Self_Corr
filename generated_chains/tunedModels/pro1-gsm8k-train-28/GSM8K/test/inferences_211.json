        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of red chickens and y be the number of white chickens.\nWe know that x + y = total number of chickens.\nWe also know that 3x + 5y = total number of eggs produced per day.\nSince Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we have 3x + 5y = 42.\nWe are given that y = x + 2.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get x + (x + 2) = total number of chickens.\nSimplifying, we get 2x + 2 = total number of chickens.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.\nSimplifying, we get 8x + 10 = 42.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8x = 32.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get x = 4.\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.\nI hope it is correct: 4",
        "ground_truth": "First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.\nThen, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2\nNow substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\nNow multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42\nNow add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42\nNow subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32\nFinally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4\n#### 4"
