His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?",

Calculate the total cost of mileage:\n15,000 miles * $2 per mile = $30,000\n\n3. Calculate the total cost of bonuses:\n$150 per month * 12 months = $1,800\n\n4. Add the cost of mileage and bonuses to get the total cost:\n$30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800\n\nI hope it is correct: $31,800$",
