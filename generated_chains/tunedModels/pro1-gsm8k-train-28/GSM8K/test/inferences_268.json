        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads: 50 ads x $5 per ad = $250\n2. Calculate the total cost of the television ads: 15 ads x $75 per ad = $1,125\n3. Add the cost of the newspaper ads and the cost of the television ads: $250 + $1,125 = $1,375\nI hope it is correct: $1,375$",
        "ground_truth": "He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.\nHe spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375 on buying all the ads.\n#### 1375"
