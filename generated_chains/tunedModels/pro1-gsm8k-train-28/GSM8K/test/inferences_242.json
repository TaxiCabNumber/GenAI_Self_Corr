Each letter is 5 pages long.\n6. So, Mike receives 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages of letters a week.\n7. He responds in kind.\n8. So, he writes 30 pages of letters a week.\n9. He can write a page every 6 minutes.\n10. So, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes writing letters a week.\n11. 180 minutes is equal to 180 / 60 = 3 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $hours$",
