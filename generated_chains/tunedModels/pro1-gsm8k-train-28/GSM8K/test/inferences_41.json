At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

To stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames, she needs to be 1000 feet away from the dragon. Therefore, she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away from the dragon and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.\nI hope it is correct: 200",
