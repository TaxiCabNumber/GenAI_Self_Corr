        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.\n\nThen, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50x.\n\nSince Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone, the maximum number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold is 6 * 50x = 300x.\n\nWe are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so we have the equation 300x = 1800.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 1800 / 300 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is 6.\n\nI hope it is correct: 6",
        "ground_truth": "Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.\nSince Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n#### 6"
