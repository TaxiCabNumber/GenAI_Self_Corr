At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDucks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the weekly insect consumption to daily consumption:\n3.5 pounds / week * (1 week / 7 days) = 0.5 pounds / day\n\n2. Multiply the daily insect consumption by the number of ducks:\n0.5 pounds / day * 10 ducks = 5 pounds / day\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $pounds$",
        "ground_truth": "The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35\nThey need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5"
