At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPeter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?",

Divide the total cost of one movie by the amount of money Peter has for the week to find how many times he can go to the movies: $42 \u00f7 $14 = 3\nI hope it is correct: 3 $answer$",
        "ground_truth": "It costs him $14 to go to the movies because 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14\nHe can go to the movies 3 times because 42 / 14 = <<42/14=3>>3\n#### 3"
