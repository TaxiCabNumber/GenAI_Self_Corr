        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?",
        "inference": "1. Let's call the number of books Elise sold in the first year \"x\".\n2. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books she sold in the current year is \"x/2\".\n3. We know that she has sold a total of 250 books, so the number of books she sold in the second year is \"250 - x - x/2 = 250 - 3x/2\".\n4. We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books, so the number of books she sold in the second year is \"250 - 50 = 200\".\n5. Therefore, we can solve for \"x\":\n```\n250 - 3x/2 = 200\n-3x/2 = -50\nx = 33.33\n```\n6. So, Elise sold 33.33 books in the first year, 16.67 books in the current year, and 200 books in the second year.\n7. The total amount of money she earned in the second year is \"200 * 20$ = 4000$\".\nI hope it is correct: $4000$",
        "ground_truth": "If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.\nThe total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.\nThe total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.\nIf each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year\n#### 1300"
