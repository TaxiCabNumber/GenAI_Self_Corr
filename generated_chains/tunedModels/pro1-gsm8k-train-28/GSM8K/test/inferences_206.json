At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMicheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?",
        "inference": "1. Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week and made 25 kilometers each time for four weeks.\n2. So, in four weeks, he rode his bike 5 x 4 = 20 times and made 25 x 20 = 500 kilometers.\n3. Then, he decided to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks.\n4. So, in three weeks, he rode his bike 2 x 3 = 6 times and made 60 x 6 = 360 kilometers.\n5. Therefore, in total, Micheal rode his bike 20 + 6 = 26 times and made 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.\nI hope it is correct: 860",
        "ground_truth": "In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.\nHe did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.\nAfter that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.\nAnd Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.\nIn total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.\n#### 860"
