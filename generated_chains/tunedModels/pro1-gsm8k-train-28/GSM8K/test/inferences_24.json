This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?",

        "ground_truth": "Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.\nCombining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50\nDividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.\n#### 26"
