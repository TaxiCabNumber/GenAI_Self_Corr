        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine Dana's running speed.\nSince Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed of running, we can set up the following equation:\nRunning speed = 4 * Walking speed\nSkipping speed = Running speed / 2\n\n**Step 2:** Find Dana's walking speed.\nSince Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and skipping speed is half the running speed, we can solve for her running speed:\nSkipping speed = 3 mph\nRunning speed = Skipping speed * 2 = 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph\nTherefore, Dana's walking speed is:\nWalking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the time spent running and walking.\nDana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.\nTime spent running = 6 hours * 1/3 = 2 hours\nTime spent walking = 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the distance traveled while running and walking.\nDistance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running\nDistance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking\nDistance traveled while running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles\nDistance traveled while walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles\n\n**Step 5:** Add the distances traveled while running and walking to find the total distance traveled.\nTotal distance traveled = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking\nTotal distance traveled = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles\n\nI hope it is correct: 18 miles",
        "ground_truth": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"
