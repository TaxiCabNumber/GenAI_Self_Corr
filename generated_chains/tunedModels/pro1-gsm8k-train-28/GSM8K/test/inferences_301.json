        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. How many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid?",
        "inference": "1. The first page is printed on the left back, so we need 1 piece of paper.\n2. The second page is printed on the left front, so we need 1 more piece of paper.\n3. The third page is printed on the right back, so we need 1 more piece of paper.\n4. The fourth page is printed on the right front, so we need 1 more piece of paper.\n5. We continue this pattern until we reach the last page, which is page 32.\n6. Page 32 is printed on the right back, so we need 1 more piece of paper.\n7. Therefore, we need a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 32 pieces of paper.\nI hope it is correct: 32",
        "ground_truth": "Each piece prints 4 pages.\nThen 32/4=<<32/4=8>>8 pieces of paper would be used.\n#### 8"
