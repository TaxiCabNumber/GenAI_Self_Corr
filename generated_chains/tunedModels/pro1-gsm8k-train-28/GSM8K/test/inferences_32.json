At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn takes care of 10 dogs.  Each dog takes .5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.  How many hours a week does he spend taking care of dogs?",
        "inference": "1. Convert .5 hours to minutes: .5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes\n2. Multiply the number of minutes by the number of dogs: 30 minutes * 10 dogs = 300 minutes\n3. Convert minutes to hours: 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours\n4. Multiply the number of hours by the number of days in a week: 5 hours * 7 days/week = 35 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 35 hours",
        "ground_truth": "He spends 10*.5=<<10*.5=5>>5 hours per day\nThat means he spends 5*7=<<5*7=35>>35 hours per week\n#### 35"
