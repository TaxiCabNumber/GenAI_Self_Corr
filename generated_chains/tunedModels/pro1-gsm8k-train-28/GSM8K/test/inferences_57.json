At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?",

Subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit to find the maximum weight that can be added to the truck: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.\n\n2. Divide the maximum weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded: 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 83 $boxes$",
