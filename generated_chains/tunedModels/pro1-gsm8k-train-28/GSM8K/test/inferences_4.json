At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEvery day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?",
        "inference": "1. Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.\n2. She needs to give each of her 20 chickens three cups of feed per day, for a total of 20 * 3 = 60 cups of feed per day.\n3. Therefore, she needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.\nI hope it is correct: 20 $answer$",
