At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHarry slept 9 hours last night. His friend James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. How many more hours did Harry sleep than James?",
        "inference": "1. Find 2/3 of 9 hours: 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours\n2. Subtract James's sleep from Harry's sleep: 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours\nI hope it is correct: 3 hours",
        "ground_truth": "James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.\nSo, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.\n#### 3"
