At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?",

Calculate the number of water type cards James has after losing: 40 - 8 = 32 cards.\n3. Calculate the number of grass type cards James has after buying: 20 + 14 = 34 cards.\n4. Calculate the total number of cards James has after losing and buying: 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.\n5. Calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card: (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%\n6.
