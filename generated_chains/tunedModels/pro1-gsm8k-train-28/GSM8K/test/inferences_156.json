He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?",

The gorillas need 400 bananas every month, so for 2 months they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.\n3. The baboons need 100 bananas every month, so for 2 months they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.\n4.
