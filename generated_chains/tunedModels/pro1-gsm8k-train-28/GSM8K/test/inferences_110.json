At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?",

Add the number of roll-ups they ate: 48 + 42 = 90\n4. Divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people: 90 / 2 = 45\nI hope it is correct: 45",
