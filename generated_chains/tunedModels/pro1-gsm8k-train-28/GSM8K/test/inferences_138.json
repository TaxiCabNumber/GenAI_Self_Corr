At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?",

He had 75 questions on the first test, so he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions incomplete.\n4. He completed 5 questions per hour on the second test.\n5. He had 6 hours to complete the second test, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.\n6. He had 100 questions on the second test, so he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions incomplete.\n7.
