At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEach person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day:\n0.2 kg/meal x 5 members x 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day\n\n2. Calculate the number of days the bag of rice will last:\n42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days\n\n3. Convert days to weeks:\n21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 weeks",
        "ground_truth": "Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.\nSo, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.\nIn a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.\nThus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.\n#### 3"
