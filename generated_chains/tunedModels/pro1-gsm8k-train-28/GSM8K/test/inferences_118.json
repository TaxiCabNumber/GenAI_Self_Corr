At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of vehicles imported on the first day.\nTotal vehicles on the first day = 2 containers x 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract the number of vehicles imported on the first day from the total number of vehicles at the port.\nVehicles imported on the second day = 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles\n\n**Step 3:** Divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by the number of vehicles per container.\nNumber of containers imported on the second day = 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers\n\n**Final Answer:** I hope it is correct: 4 $containers$",
        "ground_truth": "On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,\nOn the next day, the number of vehicles imported through the port is 30-10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles\nIf each container has 5 vehicles, the number is 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.\n#### 4"
