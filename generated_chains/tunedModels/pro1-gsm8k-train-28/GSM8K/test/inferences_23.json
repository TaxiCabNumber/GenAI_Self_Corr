        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the number of hours the candle burns: 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours\n2. Multiply the number of hours by the rate at which the candle melts: 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters\n3. The candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.\nI hope it is correct: 8 centimeters",
        "ground_truth": "The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.\nThus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.\n#### 8"
