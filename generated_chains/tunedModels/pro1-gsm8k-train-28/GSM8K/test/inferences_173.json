Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

Add the minimum payment and the amount over the minimum: $1000 + $500 = $1500\n4. Multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year: $1500 x 12 = $18000\nI hope it is correct: $18000$",
