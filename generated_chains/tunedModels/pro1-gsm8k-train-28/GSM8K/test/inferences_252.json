Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?",

Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.\n4. Therefore, Rick killed a total of 10 + 45 + 15 + 12 = 82 animals.\n\nI hope it is correct: 82",
