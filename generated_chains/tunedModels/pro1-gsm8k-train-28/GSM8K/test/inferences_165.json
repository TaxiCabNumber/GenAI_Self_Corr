        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFor his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of \u20ac1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs \u20ac1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for \u20ac157, a CD burner worth \u20ac74 and a printer for \u20ac102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?",
        "inference": "1. Sum the cost of the computer and its accessories: \u20ac1090 + \u20ac157 + \u20ac74 + \u20ac102 = \u20ac1423\n2. Subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from the budget: \u20ac1500 - \u20ac1423 = \u20ac77\nI hope it is correct: 77 $",
        "ground_truth": "First, let\u2019s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros\nLet us now calculate what is left for the garment: 1500 - 1423 = <<1500-1423=77>>77 euros\n#### 77"
