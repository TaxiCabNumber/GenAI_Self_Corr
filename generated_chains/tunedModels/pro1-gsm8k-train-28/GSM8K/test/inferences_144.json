        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client\u2019s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?",
