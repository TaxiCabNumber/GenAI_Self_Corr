        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the inner dimensions of each box:\n5 inches - 2 inches (for the walls) = 3 inches\n6 inches - 2 inches (for the walls) = 4 inches\n4 inches - 2 inches (for the walls) = 2 inches\n\n2. Calculate the inner volume of each box:\n3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches\n\n3. Multiply the inner volume of each box by the number of boxes:\n24 cubic inches x 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches\n\nI hope it is correct: 72 cubic inches",
        "ground_truth": "The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension\nSo each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width\nIt also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height\nFinally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth\nSo the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches\nSo in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches\n#### 72"
