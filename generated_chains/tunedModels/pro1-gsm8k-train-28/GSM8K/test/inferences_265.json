        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $350 000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the brokerage fee: $350 000 x 5% = $17 500\n2. Calculate the transfer fee: $350 000 x 12% = $42 000\n3. Calculate the total price of the house: $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $409 500\n4. Calculate the difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget: $409 500 - $400 000 = $9 500\nI hope it is correct: $9 500$",
        "ground_truth": "The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.\nThe transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.\nThe total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.\nSo, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.\n#### 9500"
