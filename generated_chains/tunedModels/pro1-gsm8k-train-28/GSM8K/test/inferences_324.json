At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRalph has a record store where people can trade their own records for new ones. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one. 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them. How many old records did the 5 people bring in?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assume that each person brought in x old records.\n2. So, the total number of old records brought in is 5x.\n3. Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, the total number of new records obtained is 5x/2.\n4. We know that the 5 people left with 7 new records between them. So, 5x/2 = 7.\n5. Solving for x, we get x = 14.\n6. Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 5x = 5 * 14 = 70 old records.\n\nI hope it is correct: 70",
        "ground_truth": "People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.\n5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, 7 new records x 2 old records traded for each = <<7*2=14>>14 old records that the 5 people brought in.\n#### 14"
