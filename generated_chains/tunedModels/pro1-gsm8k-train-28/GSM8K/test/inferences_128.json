At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWell's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?",
        "inference": "1. The cost of a watermelon is 3 times the cost of a pepper. So, if a pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs $3 \\times $15 = $45.\n2. The cost of an orange is $5 less than the cost of a watermelon. So, if a watermelon costs $45, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.\n3. Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. So, the total cost of the watermelons is 4 x $45 = $180.\n4. The total cost of the peppers is 20 x $15 = $300.\n5. The total cost of the oranges is 10 x $40 = $400.\n6. The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.\n\nI hope it is correct: $880$",
