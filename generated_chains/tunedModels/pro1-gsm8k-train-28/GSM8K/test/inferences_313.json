Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate the population of Chile now.",

So, the population of Chile now is 2 * (population of Chile six years ago).\n\nWe also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * x.\n\nNow, we can substitute the population of Chile six years ago into the first equation:\n\n2 * (3000 * x) = population of Chile now\n\nSimplifying:\n\n6000 * x = population of Chile now\n\nWe know that Cera is currently 46 years old. So, six years ago, she was 40 years old.\n\nSince Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 20 years old six years ago.\n\nSo, x = 20.\n\nSubstituting x into the equation:\n\n6000 * 20 = population of Chile now\n\nSimplifying:\n\n120000 = population of Chile now\n\nI hope it is correct: $120000$",
