        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaterina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the total length of the topaz gemstones in the necklace:\n8 gemstones x 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches\n\n2. Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length of the sterling silver beads:\n25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches\n\n3. Convert the length of the sterling silver beads from inches to quarters of an inch:\n17 inches x 4 quarters/inch = 68 quarters\n\n4. Since each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace is equal to the length of the sterling silver beads in quarters:\n68 quarters\n\nI hope it is correct: 68 $answer$",
        "ground_truth": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68"
