At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nI have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?",
