At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAdrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?",
