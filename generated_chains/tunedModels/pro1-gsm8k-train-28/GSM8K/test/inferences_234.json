At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSteve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grows his own cherry tomatoes.  He eats twice as much as his girlfriend.  He eats 6 per day.  If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week how many vines does he need?",
        "inference": "Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week he eats 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes.  His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes per week.  Together they eat 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes per week.  Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, they need 63 / 3 = 21 vines.\nI hope it is correct: 21",
        "ground_truth": "His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day\nSo together they eat 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 tomatoes a day\nThat means they eat 9*7=<<9*7=63>>63 tomatoes a day\nSo he needs 63/3=<<63/3=21>>21 tomato vines\n#### 21"
