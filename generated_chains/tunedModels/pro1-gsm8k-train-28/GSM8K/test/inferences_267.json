At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. The oil takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees than it takes to heat up to 300 degrees. So, it takes 20 minutes * 1.4 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.\n2. The total time to warm up the oil is 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes.\n3. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil. So, it takes 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes to cook the chicken.\n4. The total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 minutes + 43 minutes = 91 minutes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 91 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300\nSo it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up\nSo the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes\nSo it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken\nSo it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.\n#### 91"
