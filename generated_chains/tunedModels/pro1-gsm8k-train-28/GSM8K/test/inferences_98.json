At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCars have lined up on the motorway. Some of the cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 5 cars from the line take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam.
