At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?",
