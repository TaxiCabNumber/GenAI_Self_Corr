At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA customer\u2019s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. This shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?",
        "inference": "1. The customer earned $1 off for every $20 they spent, so they earned $80/$20 = 4 rewards.\n2. Each reward is worth $1, so the customer earned $4 x $1 = $4 in rewards.\n3. The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip, so the amount they paid before the coupon was $43 - $4 = $39.\n4. The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the coupon took $4 x 2 = $8 off the price.\n5. Therefore, the customer paid $39 - $8 = $31 on this shopping trip.\nI hope it is correct: $31$",
        "ground_truth": "The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.\nTheir coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.\n#### 31"
