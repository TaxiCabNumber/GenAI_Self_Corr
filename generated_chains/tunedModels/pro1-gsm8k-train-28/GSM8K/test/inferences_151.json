At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nShawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?",
        "inference": "1. 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. So, 5 * 2 * 0.25 = $2.50\n2. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. So, 3 * 3 * 0.25 = $2.25\n3. One person actually came by on a unicycle. So, 1 * 1 * 0.25 = $0.25\n4. Total amount she made that day = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00\nI hope it is correct: #### $5.00$",
