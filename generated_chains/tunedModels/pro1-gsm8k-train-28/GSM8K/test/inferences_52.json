He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?",
        "inference": "1. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.\n2. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, so if he removes 30 comic books, he will remove 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.\n3. He still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.\n4. His toys weigh 1/2 pound each, so if he removes x toys, he will remove x * 1/2 = x/2 pounds.\n5. We want to find the value of x that makes x/2 = 7.5.\n6. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 7.5 * 2 = 15.\n7. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.\nI hope it is correct: 15",
