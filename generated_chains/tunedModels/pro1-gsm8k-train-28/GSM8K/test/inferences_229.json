Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?",
        "inference": "1. 30% of 120 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. So, 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons were harvested by Ashlyn.\n2. After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. So, 3/4 * (120 - 36) = 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons were harvested by Ashlyn.\n3. Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 120 - 36 - 63 = 21.\nI hope it is correct: 21",
