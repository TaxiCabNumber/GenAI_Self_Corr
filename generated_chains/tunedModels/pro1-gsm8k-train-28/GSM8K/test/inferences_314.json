At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of players on the defense \"x\".\n\nAccording to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. So, the number of players on the offense is 2x.\n\nAlso, there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.\n\nThe total number of players on the team is 105. So, we can write an equation:\n\nx + 2x + x/2 = 105\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n3.5x = 105\n\nDividing both sides by 3.5:\n\nx = 30\n\nTherefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.\n\nI hope it is correct: 30",
        "ground_truth": "Let x represent the number of players on the defense\nOffense:2x\nSpecial Teams:(1/2)x\nTotal:x+2x+(1/2)x=105\n(7/2)x=105\nx=105(2/7)=30 players\n#### 30"
