At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the speed of the car in the fast lane to miles/minute: 60 miles/hour = 60 miles/60 minutes = 1 mile/minute\n2. Calculate the time it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles: 480 miles / 1 mile/minute = 480 minutes\n3. Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance: 480 minutes * 2 = 960 minutes\n4. Convert the time to hours: 960 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 16 hours\nI hope it is correct: 16 hours",
