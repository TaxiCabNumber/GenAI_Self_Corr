At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRobert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers. Furniture United's offer includes a $1,350 advance payment and 6 monthly installments of $350 each. Cozy Homes' offer includes a $1,100 advance payment and 9 monthly installments of $250 each. What is the cost difference between the two offers?",

Calculate the total cost of Cozy Homes' offer:\n$1,100 (advance payment) + 9 x $250 (monthly installments) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350\n\n3. Calculate the cost difference between the two offers:\n$3,450 (Furniture United's offer) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes' offer) = $100\n\n**I hope it is correct: $100$**",
