        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn wins an award at work.  The award has a 1 time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in salary.  If he makes 2000 a week, every week of the year and he got the award on the first day of the year how much money did he make that year?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate John's weekly salary after the 5% raise:\nWeekly salary after raise = $2000 x 1.05 = $2100\n\n2. Calculate the number of weeks in a year:\nWeeks in a year = 52\n\n3. Calculate John's total earnings for the year before the raise:\nTotal earnings before raise = $2000 x 52 = $104,000\n\n4. Calculate John's total earnings for the year after the raise:\nTotal earnings after raise = $2100 x 52 = $109,200\n\n5. Add the one-time monetary reward to John's total earnings after the raise:\nTotal earnings with reward = $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200\n\nI hope it is correct: $114,200$",
        "ground_truth": "He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year\nSo the raise is worth .05*104,000=$<<.05*104000=5200>>5200\nSo he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary\nSo in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200\n#### 114,200"
