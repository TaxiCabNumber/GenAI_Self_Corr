At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?",
