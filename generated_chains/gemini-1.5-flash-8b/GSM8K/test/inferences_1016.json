At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially?

Calculate the price increase for the second year: 126 * 0.05 = 6.3\n4. Calculate the price after the second year: 126 + 6.3 = 132.3\n5. Calculate the price increase for the third year: 132.3 * 0.05 = 6.615\n6. Calculate the price after the third year: 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915\n7.
