At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nVicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?",
        "inference": "1. Total time for a group's performance: 2 minutes (on) + 6 minutes (perform) + 2 minutes (off) = 10 minutes.\n2. Total time available for performances without intermission: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n3. Time for intermission: 10 minutes.\n4. Total time available for performances with allowance for intermission: 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.\n5. Number of groups that can perform: 110 minutes / 10 minutes/group = 11 groups.\n\nI hope it is correct: 11 groups\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nOf those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 \u2013 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.\nEach group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.\nOf the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.\n#### 11"
