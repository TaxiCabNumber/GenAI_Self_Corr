At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?",

Total steps taken so far: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.\n4. Elliott had 2,000 steps left.\n5. Therefore, he took 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps during his jog.\n\nI hope it is correct: 4000 $steps$\n",
