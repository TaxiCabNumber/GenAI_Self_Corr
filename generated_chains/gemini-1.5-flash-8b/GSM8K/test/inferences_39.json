At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?",
        "inference": "1. Dana's skipping speed is 3 mph.\n2. Running speed is twice the skipping speed, so running speed is 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph.\n3. Walking speed is one-fourth the running speed, so walking speed is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n4. Running time is (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.\n5. Distance covered running is 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.\n6. Walking time is (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.\n7. Distance covered walking is 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.\n8. Total distance covered is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.\n\nI hope it is correct: 18 $miles$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"
