At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer is baling hay in their field. Each hour the farmer makes 5 bales. At the same time, a truck is picking the hay bales up. Each hour the truck picks up 3 bales of hay. If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?",
        "inference": "Farmer makes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales\nTruck picks up 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales\n30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales\n\nI hope it is correct: 12 $bales$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The farmer makes 5*6= <<5*6=30>>30 bales of hay.\nThe truck takes away 3*6= <<3*6=18>>18 bales of hay.\nThere are 30-18= <<30-18=12>>12 bales of hay left in the field.\n#### 12"
