At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day how many grams of protein does he get per week?",
        "inference": "1. Protein per cup: 3 grams\n2. Cups per day: 200 grams / 100 grams/cup = 2 cups\n3. Protein per day: 2 cups * 3 grams/cup = 6 grams\n4. Protein per week: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams\n\nI hope it is correct: 42 $grams$\n",
        "ground_truth": "He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day\nSo that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day\nSo he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week\n#### 42"
