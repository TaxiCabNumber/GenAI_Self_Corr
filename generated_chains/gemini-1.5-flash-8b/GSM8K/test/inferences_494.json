If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?",

Calculate the total height of all 10 cheerleaders: 576 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches.\n\n3. Convert the total height from inches to feet: 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.\n\nI hope it is correct: 53 $feet$\n",

So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192\" tall\nThe shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60\" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252\" tall\n12\" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252\" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall\n#### 21"
