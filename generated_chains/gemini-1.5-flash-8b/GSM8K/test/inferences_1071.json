At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members.
