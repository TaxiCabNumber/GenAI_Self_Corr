At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which at the store costs $1.5 a meter. How much money will she have left over after she buys the new rope?",

Calculate the remaining money after buying the new rope: $40 - (26.67 meters * $1.5/meter) = $40 - $40 = $0\n\nI hope it is correct: $0\n",
