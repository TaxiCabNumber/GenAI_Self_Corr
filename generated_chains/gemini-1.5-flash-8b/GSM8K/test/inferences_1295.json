At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRyan\u2019s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?",

        "ground_truth": "Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nHe bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.\nThe ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.\nRyan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.\nWith the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.\n#### 2"
