At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema, and meet up with 7 more friends there. They each save a seat and then buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Each seat has enough room to hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks. If drinks and snacks cost $2 each, how much money, in dollars, has the group spent overall on snacks and drinks?",

Total drinks: 20 seats * 2 drinks/seat = 40 drinks\n5. Number of snacks per seat: 3 snacks/seat\n6. Total snacks: 20 seats * 3 snacks/seat = 60 snacks\n7. Total items: 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items\n8. Cost per item: $2/item\n9. Total cost: 100 items * $2/item = $200\n\nI hope it is correct: $200\n",
