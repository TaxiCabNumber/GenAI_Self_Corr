        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBeatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?",
        "inference": "1. Packets with 8 crayons each: 6 packets * 8 crayons/packet = 48 crayons\n2. Packets with 16 crayons each: 4 packets * 16 crayons/packet = 64 crayons\n3. Total crayons: 48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons\n\nI hope it is correct: 112 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Six packets had 6 x 8 = <<6*8=48>>48 colors of crayons.\nFour packets had 4 x 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 colors of crayons.\nTherefore, Beatrice bought 48 + 64 = <<48+64=112>>112 colors of crayons in all.\n#### 112"
