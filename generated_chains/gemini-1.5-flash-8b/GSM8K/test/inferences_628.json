At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAdam really wants to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park. You have to be 4 feet tall to ride it. Adam\u2019s height is 40 inches and he grows 2 inches a year. How many years until he is tall enough to ride it?",
        "inference": "1. Convert Adam's height to feet: 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet\n\n2. Calculate the difference in height needed: 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet\n\n3. Convert the difference to inches: 0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8.04 inches\n\n4. Divide the growth per year into the difference in height needed: 8.04 inches / 2 inches/year = 4.02 years\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $years$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8\nIt will take 4 years because 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4\n#### 4"
