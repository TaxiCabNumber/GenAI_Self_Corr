At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?",
        "inference": "Newspaper ad cost per ad: $5\nNumber of newspaper ads: 50\nTotal cost of newspaper ads: 50 * $5 = $250\n\nTelevision ad cost per ad: $75\nNumber of television ads: 15\nTotal cost of television ads: 15 * $75 = $1125\n\nTotal cost of all ads: $250 + $1125 = $1375\nI hope it is correct: $1375\n",
        "ground_truth": "He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.\nHe spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375 on buying all the ads.\n#### 1375"
