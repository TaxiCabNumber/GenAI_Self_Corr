At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?",

Days from Thursday to Saturday: 3 days\n5. Amount spent on plastic figures per day: $50 / 3 days \u2248 $16.67 (approx)\n6. Number of plastic figures per day: $16.67 / $2/figure \u2248 8.33 figures (approx)\n7. Total number of wooden figures: $20 / $5 = 4 figures\n8.
