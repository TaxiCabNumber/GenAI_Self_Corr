        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has a $14 fee for each adult and $10 for each child. If there are 2 adults and 2 children in their family, how much will they be able to save if they choose the second amusement park over the first?",
        "inference": "First Amusement Park:\nAdult cost: $26/adult * 2 adults = $52\nChild cost: $12/child * 2 children = $24\nTotal cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76\n\nSecond Amusement Park:\nAdult cost: $14/adult * 2 adults = $28\nChild cost: $10/child * 2 children = $20\nTotal cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48\n\nDifference in cost = $76 - $48 = $28\n\nI hope it is correct: $28\n",
        "ground_truth": "The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.\nSo, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.\nThe two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.\nWhile the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.\nThus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.\n#### 28"
