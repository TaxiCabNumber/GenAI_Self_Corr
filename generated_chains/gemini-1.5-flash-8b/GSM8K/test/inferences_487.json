Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?",

Oats per all horses per day: 10 pounds/day * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day\n4. Oats needed for 5 days: 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds\n5. Oats per bag: 50 pounds\n6.
