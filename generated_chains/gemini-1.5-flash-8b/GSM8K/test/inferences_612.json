At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe basketball team went to the steakhouse to eat dinner.  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.  In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?",

Total meat consumed by the first three players: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces\n5. Players 4 and 5 ate vegetarian meals, so no meat was consumed.\n6.
