At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the sum of the scores of the first five tests: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\n2.  Subtract the lowest score (71) from the sum: 438 - 71 = 367\n3.  Calculate the desired total score for all six tests, considering the removal of the lowest score: 93 * 6 = 558\n4. Calculate the score needed on the sixth test to reach the desired total score: 558 - 367 = 191\n\nI hope it is correct: 191 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.\nSince Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points\nSo far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points\nThe final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.\n#### 98"
