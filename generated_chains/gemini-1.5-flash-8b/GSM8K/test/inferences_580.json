At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the percentage difference between the set temperature (450) and the actual temperature (468):\n   Difference = 468 - 450 = 18\n   Percentage difference = (18 / 450) * 100% = 4%\n\n2.  The oven is consistently 4% too high.  To get 520 degrees, we need to find the setting that, when increased by 4%, results in 520.\n\n3. Let 'x' be the setting.  We want to find 'x' such that x + 0.04x = 520.\n\n4. Combining like terms: 1.04x = 520\n\n5. Solving for x: x = 520 / 1.04 = 500\n\nI hope it is correct: 500 $degrees$\n",
