At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMicheal loves riding a bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?",
