At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr Hezekiah had 20 trucks from his store supplying fertiliser to different farmers in his hometown dispatched for delivery on a particular day. Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser packed in bags. Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?",
        "inference": "1. Trucks with mechanical failures: 20 trucks * (1/4) = 5 trucks\n2. Trucks that delivered fertiliser: 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks\n3. Total fertiliser delivered: 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons\n\nI hope it is correct: 300 $tons$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.\nOut of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.\nSince each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.\n#### 300"
