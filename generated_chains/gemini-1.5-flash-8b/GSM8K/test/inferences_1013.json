At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJanet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?",

Calculate the desired down payment amount: 20% of $10000 = $2000\n\n4. Calculate the number of weeks needed to save the down payment: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 weeks\n",
