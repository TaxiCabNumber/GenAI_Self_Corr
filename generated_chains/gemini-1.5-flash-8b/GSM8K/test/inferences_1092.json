At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?",
        "inference": "1. The Allosaurus ate 270 kg, which is half of what was left after the velociraptors ate.  Therefore, what was left after the velociraptors was 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.\n\n2. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.  So, before the velociraptors ate, there were 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg.\n\n3. The T-Rex ate half of the original amount.  Therefore, the original amount was 1080 kg * 2 = 2160 kg.\n\nI hope it is correct: 2160 $kg$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.\nThe T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.\n#### 1080"
