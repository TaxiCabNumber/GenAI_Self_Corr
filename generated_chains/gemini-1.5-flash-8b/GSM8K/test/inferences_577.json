At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day seven he saw 90.
