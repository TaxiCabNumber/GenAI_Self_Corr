At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?",
