At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the number of large stuffed animals sold.\n2. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.\n3. The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.\n4. The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.\n5. The total earnings from large stuffed animals are 12x.\n6. The total earnings from small stuffed animals are 4 * 2x = 8x.\n7. The total earnings are 12x + 8x = $20x.\n8. We know the total earnings were $120, so 20x = 120.\n9. Solving for x: x = 120 / 20 = 6.\n10.
