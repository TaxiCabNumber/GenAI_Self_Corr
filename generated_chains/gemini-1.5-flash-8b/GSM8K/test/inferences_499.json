        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the number of guests.\nVenue 1: Fixed cost = $200\nFood cost per guest = $5\nTotal cost for Venue 1 = $200 + $5x\n\nVenue 2: Cost per guest = $25 (including food)\nTotal cost for Venue 2 = $25x\n\nTo find the number of guests where the costs are equal, set the two equations equal to each other:\n$200 + 5x = 25x$\nSubtract 5x from both sides:\n$200 = 20x$\nDivide both sides by 20:\n$x = 10$\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $guests$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.\nNext we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.\nBy subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.\nThen, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.\n#### 10"
