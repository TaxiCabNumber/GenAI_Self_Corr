At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBlake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?",

Total distance for Blake is 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.\nKelly runs once back and forth, which is 2 * 100 yards = 200 yards.  Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering 2 * 40 yards = 80 yards each time.
