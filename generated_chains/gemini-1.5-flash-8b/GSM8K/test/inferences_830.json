She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?",

Makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week\n4. Total TikTok time per week: 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes/week\n5.
