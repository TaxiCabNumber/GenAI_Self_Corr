At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?",
