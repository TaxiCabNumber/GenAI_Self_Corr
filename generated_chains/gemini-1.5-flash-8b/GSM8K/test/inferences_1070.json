At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants that he makes.  He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.  The grocery store currently has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off.  If the butter costs $4.00 a pound, how much will it cost him to purchase 6 pounds of butter?",

This means he gets 1 pound of butter for half the price.\n3. The regular price for 1 pound of butter is $4.00.\n4. The discounted price for 1 pound of butter is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00\n5. Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and discounted price for 3 pounds.\n6. Cost for 3 pounds at full price: 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00\n7.
