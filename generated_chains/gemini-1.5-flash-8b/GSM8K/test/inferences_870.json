At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMadeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries. In total, they spend about $400 per month. In a four-week month, how many dollars does Keenan spend per week if Madeline pays 60% of the cost?",
