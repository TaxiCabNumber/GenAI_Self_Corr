At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?",

Total toys produced by 2 workers producing 4 toys/hour: 2 workers * 4 toys/hour/worker * 10 hours = 80 toys\n3. Total toys produced by all 4 workers: 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys\n4. Toys produced by the fifth worker needed: 400 toys (total order) - 200 toys (produced by other workers) - 20 toys (remaining needed) = 180 toys\n5. Hours worked by the fifth worker: 10 hours\n6.
