At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.",

Calculate the cost of the expired milk: 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600\n4. Calculate the refund amount: $5600\n\nI hope it is correct: $5600\n",
