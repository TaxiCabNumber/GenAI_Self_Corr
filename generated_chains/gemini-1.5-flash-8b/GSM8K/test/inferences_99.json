        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",
        "inference": "1. Plants on window ledges initially: 40 ledges * 2 plants/ledge = 80 plants\n2. Plants received: 18 plants\n3. Total plants: 80 + 18 = 98 plants\n4. Plants given away: 40 plants\n5. Remaining plants: 98 - 40 = 58 plants\n\nI hope it is correct: 58 $plants$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary\u2019s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58"
