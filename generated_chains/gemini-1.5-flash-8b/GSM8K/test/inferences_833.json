At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNaruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?",

Kagiyami lifts 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami lifts 4 * 12 = 48 inches.\n4. Naruto lifts 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto lifts 10 * 48 = 480 inches.\n5. Convert inches to feet: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.\n\nI hope it is correct: 40 $feet$\n",
