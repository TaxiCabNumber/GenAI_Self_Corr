At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. How many pages are in the book, if it is 1.5 inches thick?",
