At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?",

Funding for the 7th month: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000\n\n5. Funding pattern:  The funding increases by 50% each month. This is a geometric progression. The general term for the geometric progression is a * r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number.  In this case, a = $150,000 and r = 1.5\n\n6.
