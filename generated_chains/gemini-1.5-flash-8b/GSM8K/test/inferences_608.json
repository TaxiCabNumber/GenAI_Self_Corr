At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?",

Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50\n4. Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount: $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50\n\nI hope it is correct: -2.50 $\n",
