At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?",
        "inference": "1. Manicure cost: $35\n2. Pedicure cost: $40\n3. Combined cost without discount: $35 + $40 = $75\n4. Discount: 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15\n5. Discounted combined cost: $75 - $15 = $60\n6. Number of nails: 10 (hands) + 10 (feet) = 20 nails\n7. Nail art cost: $3/nail * 20 nails = $60\n8. Total cost: $60 (discounted combined cost) + $60 (nail art) = $120\n\nI hope it is correct: 120$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90"
