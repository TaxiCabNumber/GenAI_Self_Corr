At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\n3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.\n2. The number of shoplifters kicked out is 4x - 5.\n3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence is 3 * (4x - 5).\n4. The total number of people kicked out is x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50.\n5. Simplify the equation: x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50\n6. Combine like terms: 17x - 20 = 50\n7. Add 20 to both sides: 17x = 70\n8. Divide both sides by 17: x = 70/17  \u2248 4.12\n9. Since we are dealing with whole numbers of people,  we can round 70/17 to the nearest whole number, which is 4.\n10. Substitute x = 4 into the expressions:\n   - Mask Refusal: 4\n   - Shoplifting: 4 * 4 - 5 = 11\n   - Physical Violence: 3 * 11 = 33\n11. Calculate the total kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence: 4 + 11 + 33 = 48\n12. Calculate the number of people kicked out for other reasons: 50 - 48 = 2\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 $answer$\n",
