At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJulia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother. The two girls decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought a cake which costs $11. They also bought 1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons. The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?",

Total spent on cake and balloons = $11 + $3 = $14\n4. Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream = 2 * $7 = $14\n5. Total money spent = $14 + $14 = $28\n6. Since they combined their allowances, and spent the total amount, each girl received half the total amount:\n   Allowance per girl = $28 / 2 = $14\n\nI hope it is correct: $14\n",
