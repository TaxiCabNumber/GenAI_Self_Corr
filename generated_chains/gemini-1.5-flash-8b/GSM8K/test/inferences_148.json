At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money, in dollars, did she give the cashier?",
