At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA classroom has a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?",
        "inference": "1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.\n2. Each lesson has the whiteboard cleaned 3 times.\n3. Total lessons per day for all teachers = 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons\n4. Total whiteboard cleanings per day = 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.\nThe whiteboard is therefore cleaned 8 lessons * 3 cleans per lesson = <<8*3=24>>24 times.\n#### 24"
