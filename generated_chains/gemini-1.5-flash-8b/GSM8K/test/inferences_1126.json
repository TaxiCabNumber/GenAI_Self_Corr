At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day.  If the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, how many days will it take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth?",
        "inference": "Half the circumference of the Earth is 40000 km / 2 = 20000 km.  To find the number of days, divide the total distance by the daily distance: 20000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.\n\nI hope it is correct: 50 $days$\n",
