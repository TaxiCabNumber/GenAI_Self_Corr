At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarrie is planning the caroling schedule. The choir plans to sing \"Deck the Halls\" twice and \"Jingle Bells\" once. If \"Deck the Halls\" is 150 seconds long and \"Jingle Bells\" is 240 seconds long, how long will they be caroling?",

The total caroling time is the sum of the times for each song: 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 540 $seconds$\n",
