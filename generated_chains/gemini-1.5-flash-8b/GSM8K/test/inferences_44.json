For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?",

Cost of supplies: $10.00/pound * 2 pounds = $20.00\n5. Revenue from sales: 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00\n6. Net profit: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $20.00\n",
