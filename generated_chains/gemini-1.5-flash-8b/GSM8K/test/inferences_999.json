At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' represent the fraction of the watermelon each kid gets.\n2. Each adult gets twice the slice of a kid, so each adult gets 2x.\n3. The sum of the fractions for all family members equals 1 (whole watermelon).\n   Therefore, 2x (for each adult) * 2 + x (for each kid) * 4 = 1\n   4x + 4x = 1\n   8x = 1\n   x = 1/8\n4. Each kid gets 1/8 of the watermelon.\n5. Each adult gets 2 * (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of the watermelon.\n6. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%\n\nI hope it is correct: 25%\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25"
