At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo make a call from a payphone, you must pay $0.25 for each minute of your call.

Cost for the remaining 20 minutes: 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00\n\n4. Total cost: $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $8.00\n",
