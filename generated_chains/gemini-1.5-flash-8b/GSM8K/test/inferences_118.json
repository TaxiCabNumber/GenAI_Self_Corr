At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted 2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.",

Vehicles imported on the second day: 30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles\n4. Number of containers on the second day: 20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $containers$\n",
