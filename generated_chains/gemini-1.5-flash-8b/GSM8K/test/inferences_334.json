At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun and Richard has 5 guns. If they were to share their guns equally, how many guns would each of them have?",
