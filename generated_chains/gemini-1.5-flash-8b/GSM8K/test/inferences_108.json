At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHenry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?",

He baked 15 more than planned, so he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies.\n4. He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.\n5. He now has a total of 110 cookies, so 2x + 10 = 110.\n6. Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100.\n7. Divide both sides by 2: x = 50.\n\nI hope it is correct: 50 cookies\n",
