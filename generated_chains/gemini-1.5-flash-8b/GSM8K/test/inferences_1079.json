At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?",
        "inference": "1. Original price of the watch: $2000\n\n2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price: $2000 * 0.75 = $1500\n\n3. Mr. Rogers sold the watch at 120% of the price he bought it: $1500 * 1.20 = $1800\n\n4. The discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is the difference between the original price and the price he paid: $2000 - $1800 = $200\n\n5. The percentage discount is the discount divided by the original price, multiplied by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%\n\nI hope it is correct: 10%\n",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10"
