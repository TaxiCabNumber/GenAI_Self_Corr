At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?",
        "inference": "1. Distance from second to third city: 100 miles\n2. Distance from first to second city: 75 miles\n3. Combined distance from second to third and first to second: 100 + 75 = 175 miles\n4. Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles\n5. Total distance per trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles\n6. Total distance per day: 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day\n7. Total miles between services: 18,000 miles\n8. Days between services: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 $days$\n",
