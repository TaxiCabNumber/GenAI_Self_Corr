James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  How old will John's youngest son, who was born when John was 32, be in 3 years?",

John was 19 when James was born, so John is currently 18 + 19 = 37 years old.\n\n4. John was 32 when his youngest son was born, meaning the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.\n\n5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.\n\nI hope it is correct: 8\n",
