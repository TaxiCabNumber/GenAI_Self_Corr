At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe recent floods in Mamou\u2019s country have left many families without food or shelter. To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday.
