        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTopher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher\u2019s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby\u2019s shoes?",
        "inference": "1. Convert Topher's shoe length to inches: 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches.  8 feet 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\n2. Let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.  The problem states that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length.  This translates to the equation: 100 = 9x + 10\n\n3. Solve for x:\n   100 = 9x + 10\n   90 = 9x\n   x = 10\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $inches$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since Topher\u2019s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher\u2019s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10"
