At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?",
