At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. Then a boy got 6 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?",

Subtract the water the girls got from the total: 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters.\n3. Subtract the water the boy got from the remaining amount: 16 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters.\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $liters$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.\nSo the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.\nThus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.\nTherefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.\n#### 10"
