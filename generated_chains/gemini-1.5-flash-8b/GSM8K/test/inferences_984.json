        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",
        "inference": "1. Convert flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches\n\n2. Calculate space per plant in inches: 1.5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches\n\n3. Calculate the number of plants needed:  (1332 inches / 18 inches/plant) = 74 plants\n\n4. Calculate the number of additional plants needed: 74 plants - 17 plants = 57 plants\n\n5. Calculate the cost of additional plants: 57 plants * $6/plant = $342\n\nI hope it is correct: $342\n",
        "ground_truth": "Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.\nPat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.\nPat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.\n#### 342"
