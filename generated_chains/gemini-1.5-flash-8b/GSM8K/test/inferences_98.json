At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCars have lined up on the motorway. Some of the cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, then 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. 5 cars from the line take an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?",

Cars that passed through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20\n6. Total cars that passed through: x + 20\n7. Total cars remaining in the traffic jam after the first 15 minutes, plus those that passed through in the second 15 minutes equals the original number of cars minus those that exited: x + 20 + 0 = 25\n8.
