At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?",
        "inference": "1. Jack's playing time: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes\n2. Jack's quarters: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters\n3. Friend 1's playing time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes\n4. Friend 1's quarters: 120 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 6 quarters\n5. Friend 2's playing time: 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes\n6. Friend 2's quarters: 120 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 6 quarters\n7. Friend 3's playing time: 240 minutes * 1.5 = 360 minutes\n8. Friend 3's quarters: 360 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 18 quarters\n9. Total quarters: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters\n10. Total money: 42 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $10.50\n\nI hope it is correct: $10.50\n",
        "ground_truth": "Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour\nSo he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour\nHis two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour\nSo they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour\nHis last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour\nSo he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour\nSo in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour\nSo they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours\n#### 11"
