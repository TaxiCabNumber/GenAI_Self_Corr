        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?",
        "inference": "1. Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches\n2. Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches\n3. Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet\n4. Convert inches to feet: 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet\n5. Convert inches to feet: 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet\n6. Total length in feet: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet\n\nI hope it is correct: 280 $feet$\n",
