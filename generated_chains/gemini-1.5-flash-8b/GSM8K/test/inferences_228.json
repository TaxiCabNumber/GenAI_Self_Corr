At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?",
