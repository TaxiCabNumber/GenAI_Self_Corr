At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?",

Increase after the first year (year 6): 10% of $660 = $66\n\n5. Salary after year 6: $660 + $66 = $726\n\n6. Increase after the second year (year 7): 10% of $726 = $72.60\n\n7. Salary after year 7: $726 + $72.60 = $798.60\n\n8. Increase after the third year (year 8): 10% of $798.60 = $79.86\n\n9. Salary after year 8: $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46\n\nI hope it is correct: 878.46$\n",
