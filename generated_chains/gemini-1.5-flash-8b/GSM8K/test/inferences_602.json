At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the plane's speed: Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles/hour.\n\n2. Calculate the time needed for the additional 2000 miles: Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles/hour = 5 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $hours$\n",
