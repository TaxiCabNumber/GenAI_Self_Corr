At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRicardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes while each plant of eggplant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?",
        "inference": "Tomatoes from 5 plants: 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes\nEggplants from 8 plants: 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants\nTotal fruits: 110 + 32 = 142\nI hope it is correct: 142 fruits\n",
