At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the number of strawberry cubes.\nThe number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.\nThe total number of ice cubes is x + (5x - 4) = 116.\nCombining like terms: 6x - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides: 6x = 120\nDividing both sides by 6: x = 20\nThe number of strawberry cubes is 20.\nThe number of blueberry cubes is 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.\nI hope it is correct: 96$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120\nDividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20\nSubstituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96\n#### 96"
