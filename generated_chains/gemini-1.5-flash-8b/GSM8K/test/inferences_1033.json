At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelissa is summoned to jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. If Melissa is paid $15 per day but also has to pay $3 for parking each day, how much jury pay does she make per hour after expenses?",
        "inference": "1. Total hours spent: 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours\n2. Total pay: $15/day * 3 days = $45\n3. Total parking expenses: $3/day * 3 days = $9\n4. Net pay: $45 - $9 = $36\n5. Jury pay per hour: $36 / 18 hours = $2/hour\n\nI hope it is correct: $2\n",
        "ground_truth": "First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day\nThen divide this number by the number of hours Melissa spends in court each day to find her hourly pay: $12/day / 6 hours/day = $<<12/6=2>>2/hour\n#### 2"
