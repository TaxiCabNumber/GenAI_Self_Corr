        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArtie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?",
