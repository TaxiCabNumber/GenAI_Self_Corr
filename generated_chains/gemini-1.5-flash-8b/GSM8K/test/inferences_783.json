        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?",
        "inference": "1. Initial fish: 7 fish total, 3 orange, 4 white.\n2. Let 'x' be the number of white fish Bob bought.\n3. Let 'y' be the number of orange fish Bob bought.\n4. Total fish after purchase: 7 + x + y = 7 + 17 = 24\n5. Fish after purchase: orange = 3 + y, white = 4 + x\n6. Twice as many orange as white: 3 + y = 2 * (4 + x)\n7. Substituting the total fish equation into the orange-white equation:\n   3 + y = 2 * (4 + x)\n8. Simplifying the total fish equation: 7 + x + y = 24, thus x + y = 17\n9. Solving for y from x + y = 17: y = 17 - x\n10. Substitute y in the orange-white equation:\n    3 + (17 - x) = 2 * (4 + x)\n11. Simplify: 20 - x = 8 + 2x\n12. Simplify further: 12 = 3x\n13. Solve for x: x = 4\n14. Calculate y: y = 17 - x = 17 - 4 = 13\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $white fish$\n",
