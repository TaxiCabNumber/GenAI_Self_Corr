At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDebra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?",

This includes the initial 30 + the 60 that left later = 90 bees return.\n\nI hope it is correct: 90 $answer$\n",
