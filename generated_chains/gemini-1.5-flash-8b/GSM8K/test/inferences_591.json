At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFour dogs sat in a line within the veterinarian's waiting room.  The first dog was the Affenpinscher, who weighed only 10 pounds.  Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.  And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?",
        "inference": "1. Affenpinscher: 10 pounds\n2. Dachshund: 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds\n3. Papillon: 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds\n4. Mastiff: 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 220 $answer$\n",
