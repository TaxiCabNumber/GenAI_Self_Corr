At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA bus has a capacity of 200 people. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.",

Passengers = 20 + 40 = 60\n* **Stop 2:** 3/4 of the passengers who entered at the previous stop enter, so (3/4) * 40 = 30 passengers enter.
