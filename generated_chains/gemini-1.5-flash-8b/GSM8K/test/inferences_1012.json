Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends\u2019 phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. 5 hours later the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.\n\nAfter 5 hours of losing 9% per hour, the remaining charge is:\nx * (1 - 0.09)^5 = x * (0.91)^5\n\nAfter another 3 hours of losing 7% per hour, the remaining charge is:\nx * (0.91)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3 = x * (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3\n\nWe know the final remaining charge is 28%, so:\nx * (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 = 0.28 * x\n\nDividing both sides by x (assuming x is not zero):\n(0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 = 0.28\n\nCalculating the values:\n(0.91)^5 \u2248 0.6634\n(0.93)^3 \u2248 0.8088\n0.6634 * 0.8088 \u2248 0.536\n\n0.536 \u2248 0.28  This is incorrect.\n\nLet's recalculate:\n(0.91)^5 \u2248 0.66342\n(0.93)^3 \u2248 0.8087\n0.66342 * 0.8087 \u2248 0.5368\n\nWe have:\n0.5368x = 0.28x  This seems wrong.\n\n(0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 = 0.28\nx * (0.91)^5 * (0.93)^3 = 0.28x\n\n0.6634 * 0.8087 = 0.5368  This is the remaining fraction after the losses.
