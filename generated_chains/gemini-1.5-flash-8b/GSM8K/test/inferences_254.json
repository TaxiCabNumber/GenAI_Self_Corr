        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear about the units.  Assuming the units are \"times down the slide\", the solution is:\n\nAnne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.  Let Mitchel's slides be 'x'.  Then Anne's slides are x - 0.30x = 0.70x.\n\nRobert went down 4 times as much as Anne.  So Robert's slides are 4 * 0.70x = 2.8x.\n\nThe problem lacks the value of Mitchel's slides, 'x'.  Without knowing x, we can't determine the exact number of times Robert went down the slide.  Therefore, there's no numerical answer to the question.\n#### $no answer$\n",
