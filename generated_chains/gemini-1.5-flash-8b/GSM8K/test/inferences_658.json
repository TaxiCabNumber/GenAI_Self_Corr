At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFinley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?",
