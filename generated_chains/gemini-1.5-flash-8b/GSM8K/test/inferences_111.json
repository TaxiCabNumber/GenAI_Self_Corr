At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJulia\u2019s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?",

        "ground_truth": "It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.\nThus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.\nIn those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.\nThus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.\n#### 16"

        "inference": "The problem statement lacks crucial context.  To calculate the water absorbed, we need to know if the rowing speed is the speed of the boat, the speed of the rower, or something else.  More importantly, we need to know the relationship between the absorbed water and the distance traveled.\n\nWithout more information, the problem cannot be solved.\n\n#### $cannot be determined$\n",
