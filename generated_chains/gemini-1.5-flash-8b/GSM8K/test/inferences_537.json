At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFour books are arranged on a shelf. The first book is 31 mm thick while the second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book. What is the total thickness of the four books?",
