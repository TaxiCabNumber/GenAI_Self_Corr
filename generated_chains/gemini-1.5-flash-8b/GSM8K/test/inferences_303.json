At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?",

Books sold in the second year: 135 - 90 = 45\n5. Amount earned in the second year: 45 books * $20/book = $900\n\nI hope it is correct: $900\n",
