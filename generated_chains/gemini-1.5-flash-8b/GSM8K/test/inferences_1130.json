At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?",
