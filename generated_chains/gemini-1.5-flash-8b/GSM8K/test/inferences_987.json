Carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and they plant 10: 1.5 pounds/carnation * 10 carnations = 15 pounds\n3. Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds\n4. Remaining soil: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds\n5. Each rose needs 1 pound, so they can plant: 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $roses$\n",
