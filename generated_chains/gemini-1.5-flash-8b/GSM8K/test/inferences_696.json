At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStudents in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?",

Tom's points: Tom collected 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.\n\n3. Martha's points: Martha collected 3 times more than Tom, so Martha has 35 * 3 = 105 points.\n\n4. Total points: The total points collected by the class is 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.\n\n5.
