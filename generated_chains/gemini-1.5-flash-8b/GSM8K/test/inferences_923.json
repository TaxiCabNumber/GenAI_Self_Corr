At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?",
        "inference": "1. Total cups: 27\n2. Rows: 3\n3. Cups per row: 27 / 3 = 9 cups\n4. Equal amounts of chamomile and mint in each row: 9 cups / 2 = 4.5 cups\n5. Since you can't have half a cup, there must be an error in the problem statement.  Assuming the problem intends for the total cups in each row to be evenly divisible by 2 to get whole number of chamomile and mint cups.\n6. Since 9 is not divisible by 2, we assume that the question meant 28 cups instead. If that is the case, then\n   * Total cups per row: 28 / 3 = 9 with a remainder of 1. If we assume the remainder is divided among the tea varieties, we would need more details to correctly solve. \n7. Assuming the problem intended for an even division:\n   * Total cups per row: 9\n   * Chamomile and Mint per row: 9 / 2 = 4.5\n   * Again, we can't have half a cup of tea.\n8. If there are 27 cups and we need to divide among 3 rows with an even division of chamomile and mint, the total number of cups must be a multiple of 6. Since we don't have enough cups, we have to assume that the question needs to be rephrased. In this case, we cannot determine the number of mint cups per row.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: Not enough information\n",
