At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?",

Sleepwalking time: 2:15 AM to 2:38 AM = 23 minutes.\n4. Total sleep time before sleepwalking: 5:55 AM - 10 PM = 7 hours and 55 minutes = 7 * 60 + 55 = 475 minutes.\n5.

If the person slept through the sleepwalking period without waking up, there is no way to know the *total* time spent asleep.  The sleepwalking period is *part* of the total sleep time.\n8. The new wakeup time is irrelevant to the calculation.\n9. Total sleep time before sleepwalking = 255 minutes.\n10. Time spent asleep including sleepwalking = 255 minutes. \n\n#### $255$\n",
