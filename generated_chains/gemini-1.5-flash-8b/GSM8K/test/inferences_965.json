        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA bird decides to leave her summer home in the north and travel to her winter home in the south.  To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?",
        "inference": "1.  **Northward flight:** 10 hours * 30 mph = 300 miles south\n2.  **Northward flight:** 2 hours * 18 mph = 36 miles north\n3.  **Southward flight:** 5 hours * 22 mph = 110 miles south\n4.  **Total southward distance:** 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles south\n5.  **Total northward distance:** 36 miles north\n6.  **Difference in distance:** 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles\n\nI hope it is correct: 374 $miles$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.\nFlying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.\nAnd flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.\nAltogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles\n#### 374"
