At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.",
