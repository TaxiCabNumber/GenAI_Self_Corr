At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?",

He ordered 100 more, meaning he now has 250 + 100 = 350 candies.\n4.  He needs to sell 350 candies - 100 candies = 250 candies\n\nI hope it is correct: 250 $\n",
