At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?",

Cooking time: 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes\n5. Total time: 48 minutes + 43 minutes = 91 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 91 $minutes$\n",
