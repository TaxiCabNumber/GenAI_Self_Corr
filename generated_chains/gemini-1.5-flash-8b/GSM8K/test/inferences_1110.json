She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?",

Total miles covered in June (if she walks 250 miles/day): 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles\n5. Miles needed: 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles\n6.
