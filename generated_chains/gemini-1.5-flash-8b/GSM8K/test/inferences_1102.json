At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSheila charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.  She ended up returning one item that cost $15.00.  After she returned the item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.  She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  What is the new balance on her credit card?",

Discounted frying pan price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00\n6. Towels discount: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00\n7. Discounted towel price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00\n8.
