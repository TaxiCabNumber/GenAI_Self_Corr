Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.  If he orders 4 packs of bagels, he will receive a 10% discount.  After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?",

Total cost after discount: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00\n6. Total bagels: 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels\n7. Cost per bagel: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $1.00\n",
