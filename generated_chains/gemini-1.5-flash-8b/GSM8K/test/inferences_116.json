At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaty makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the common multiple for the ratio of sugar to water.\n2. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the amount of sugar is 7x and the amount of water is 13x.\n3. The total amount of sugar and water is 7x + 13x = 20x.\n4. We are given that the total amount is 120, so 20x = 120.\n5. Solving for x, x = 120 / 20 = 6.\n6. The amount of sugar used is 7x = 7 * 6 = 42.\n\nI hope it is correct: 42 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20\nSince the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42\n#### 42"
