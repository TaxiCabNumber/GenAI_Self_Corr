At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDonny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",

Let 'x' be the temperature of the second mug in degrees.\n4. He pours 1 ounce of water from the second bottle into the bottle.\n5. The combined amount of water in the bottle is now 5 ounces.\n6. Let the proportion of the first mug be 4/5 and the proportion of the second mug be 1/5.\n7. The average temperature is calculated as: [(4/5)*33 + (1/5)*x] >= 40\n8. Simplifying the inequality: [(132 + x)/5] >= 40\n9. Multiply both sides by 5: (132+x) >= 200\n10. Subtract 132 from both sides: x >= 68\nI hope it is correct: 68 $degrees$\n",
