At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?",
        "inference": "1. Low setting: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooled\n2. High setting: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooled\n3. Warming up: 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmed\n4. Total cooling: 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees\n5. Total warming: 4 degrees\n6. Net cooling: 18 degrees - 4 degrees = 14 degrees\n\nI hope it is correct: 14 $degrees$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.\nIt then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.\nIt was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.\nThus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.\n#### 14"
