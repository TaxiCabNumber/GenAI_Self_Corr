At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCrista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?",
