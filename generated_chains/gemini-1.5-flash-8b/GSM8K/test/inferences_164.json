At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJackie is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?",
