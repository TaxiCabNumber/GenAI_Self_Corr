The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?",

Half of the change = ($10 - $1.5 * pounds of candy) / 2\n6. Amount spent on gumballs = ($10 - $1.5 * pounds of candy) / 2 = $2\n7. $10 - $1.5 * pounds of candy = $4\n8. $1.5 * pounds of candy = $6\n9. pounds of candy = $6 / $1.5 = 4\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $pounds$\n",
