If it costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse, and the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each, how many bags did he sell?",

Total profit = Profit per bag * Number of bags\n\n4. Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag = $400 / $8 = 50\n\nI hope it is correct: 50 $bags$\n",
