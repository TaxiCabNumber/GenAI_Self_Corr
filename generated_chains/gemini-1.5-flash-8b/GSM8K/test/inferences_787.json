At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSamwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?",
