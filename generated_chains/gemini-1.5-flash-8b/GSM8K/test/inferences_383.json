At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMillie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?",
