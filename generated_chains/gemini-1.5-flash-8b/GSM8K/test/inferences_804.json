At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?",
