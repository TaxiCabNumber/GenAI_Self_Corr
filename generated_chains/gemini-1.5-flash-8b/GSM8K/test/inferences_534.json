At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?",
        "inference": "1. Since there are 20 kids and two equal groups, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.\n\n2. Boys brought 60 shells each, so total shells brought by boys = 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.\n\n3. Girls brought shells equal to the number of shells brought by boys + 4 times the number of shells brought by boys.\n   Girls' shells = 600 shells + 4 * 600 shells = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.\n\n4. Since there are 10 girls, shells brought by each girl = 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells/girl.\n\nI hope it is correct: 300 $answer$\n",
