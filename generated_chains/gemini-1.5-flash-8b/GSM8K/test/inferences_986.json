In each basket she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost $3.00 apiece and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.  How much will she spend filling all 5 hanging baskets?",

Total cost per basket: $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00\n4. Total cost for 5 baskets: $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $70.00\n",
