She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?",
        "inference": "1. Mrs. Harrington gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.\n2. The number of boxes remaining is 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.\n3. Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept (1/4) * 12 = 3 boxes.\n4. The number of boxes she sold is 8 - 3 = 5 boxes.\n5. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is 5 * 20 = 100 oranges.\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 oranges\n",
