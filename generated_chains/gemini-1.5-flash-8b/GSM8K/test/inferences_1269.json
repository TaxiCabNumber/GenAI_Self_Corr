At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?",
        "inference": "1. Westward travel: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 mph \u00d7 5 hours = 90 miles.\n2. Eastward travel: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 18 mph \u00d7 8 hours = 144 miles.\n3. Net displacement: Since he traveled east after traveling west, we need to find the difference in the distances.  |90 - 144| = 54 miles.\n4. Conclusion: Elvis is 54 miles from his house.\n\nI hope it is correct: 54 $miles$\n",
