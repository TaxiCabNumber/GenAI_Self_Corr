At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIf Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the amount of fence Sam gets.\n2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.\n3. Together, they use 'x + (x + 60)' feet of fence.\n4. The total fence is 100 feet, so x + (x + 60) = 100.\n5. Simplifying the equation: 2x + 60 = 100\n6. Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40\n7. Divide both sides by 2: x = 20\n8. Sam gets 20 feet of fence.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 $feet$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nSubtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n#### 20"
