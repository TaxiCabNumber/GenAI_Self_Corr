He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?",

Total holes to fill: 84 holes\n\n5. Days to fill holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days\n\n6. Weeks to fill holes: 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 weeks\n",
