At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?",

Time spent watching shows: 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours\n5. Percentage of time spent watching shows: 30%\n6. Total time spent: 6 hours / 0.30 = 20 hours\n7. Time spent sightseeing: 20 hours * 0.40 = 8 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming\nHe spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows\nSo he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities\nThat means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities\nSo he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing\n#### 20"
