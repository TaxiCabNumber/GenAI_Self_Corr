At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?",
        "inference": "1. Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes\n2. Distance on the beach = 2 miles\n3. Speed on the beach = Distance / Time = 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 miles/minute\n4. Speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Speed on the beach = 2 * (1/20 miles/minute) = 1/10 miles/minute\n5. Distance on the sidewalk = 1 mile\n6. Time spent on the sidewalk = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / (1/10 miles/minute) = 10 minutes\n7. Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 50 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.\nTo walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 50"
