At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves. How many did each person get?",

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.\n\n3. Total seashells: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells\n\n4.
