At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?",
        "inference": "1. Wanda filled 1/4 of 18000 gallons on the first day, which is (1/4) * 18000 = 4500 gallons.\n2. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 = 3375 gallons.\n3. Total gallons pumped on the first day = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.\n4. On the second day, Wanda pumped (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons.\n5. Ms. B pumped (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons.\n6. Total gallons pumped on the second day = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.\n7. Total gallons pumped in two days = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.\n8. Gallons remaining = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 6000 $gallons$\n",
