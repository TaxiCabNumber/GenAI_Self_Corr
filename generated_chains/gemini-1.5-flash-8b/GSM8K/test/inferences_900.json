At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDenise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday, while Daniel was not able to read any pages today. How many more pages did Denise read more than Daniel?",
        "inference": "1. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.\n2. Denise read 5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday.  So Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.\n3. Denise read a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages.\n4. Daniel read a total of 13 pages.\n5. The difference in pages read is 28 - 13 = 15 pages.\n\nI hope it is correct: 15 $pages$\n",

It's unclear how many pages Denise read yesterday.\n\nLet's assume the question asks for the difference in the total number of pages read by Daniel and Denise.\n\n1. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.\n2. Denise read 5 more than Daniel yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages yesterday.\n3.  The problem statement is unclear. We need to know if Denise also read pages today.  If so, we need more information.
