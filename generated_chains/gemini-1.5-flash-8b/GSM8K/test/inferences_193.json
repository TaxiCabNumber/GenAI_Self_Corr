At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSue lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",
        "inference": "1. Friday: 18 pink flamingos\n2. Saturday: 1/3 of 18 pink flamingos = 6 pink flamingos removed and painted white.  \n   Remaining pink flamingos = 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.\n   White flamingos = 6\n3. Sunday: 18 more pink flamingos added.\n   Total pink flamingos = 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos\n   White flamingos = 6\n4. Difference = 30 - 6 = 24\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 $pink flamingos$\n",
        "ground_truth": "On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.\nThis left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.\nOn Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.\nAltogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.\n#### 24"
