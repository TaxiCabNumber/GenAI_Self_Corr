At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the number of players on defense.\n2. There are twice as many players on offense as on defense, so the number of offensive players is 2x.\n3. There are half the number of players on special teams as on defense, so the number of special teams players is x/2.\n4. The total number of players is the sum of the players on offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105\n5. Combining like terms: 3.5x = 105\n6. Solving for x: x = 105 / 3.5\n7. x = 30\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $players$\n",
