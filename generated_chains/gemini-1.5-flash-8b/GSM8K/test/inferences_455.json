He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?",

Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all 10 beds: 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet\n\n3. Calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags\n\n4. Calculate the total cost: 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920\n\nI hope it is correct: $1920\n",
