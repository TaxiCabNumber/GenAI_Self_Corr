At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?",
        "inference": "1. Trekking bikes sold: 300 bikes * 1/2 = 150 bikes\n2. BMX bikes sold: 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 bikes\n3. MTB bikes sold: 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 bikes\n4. Price of a BMX bike: $500 / 2 = $250\n5. Total earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500\n6. Total earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250\n7. Total earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500\n8. Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250\n\nI hope it is correct: $131250\n",
