At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
        "inference": "1. Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade at a 1 cup juice/gallon ratio, meaning he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.\n2.  6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, so 4 cups of juice require 4 * 6 = 24 lemons.\n3.  Allen wants an extra gallon twice as tart, meaning it will also require 1 cup of lemon juice.\n4.  This extra gallon needs 6 lemons.\n5.  Total lemons needed: 24 + 6 = 30 lemons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $lemons$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch\nIn addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total\nAll total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice\nEach cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed\n#### 36"
