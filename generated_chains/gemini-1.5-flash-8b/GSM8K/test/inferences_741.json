At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?",
        "inference": "1. Birds scared away: 12 birds * (1/3) = 4 birds\n2. Birds remaining: 12 birds - 4 birds = 8 birds\n3. Total birds: 8 birds + 20 birds = 28 birds\n\nI hope it is correct: 28 $answer$\n",
