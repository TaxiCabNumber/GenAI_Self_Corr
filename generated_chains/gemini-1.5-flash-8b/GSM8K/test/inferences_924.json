At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?",
        "inference": "To collect 24 berries in 8 hours, the sloth needs to make 24 berries / 4 hours/trip = 6 trips.\nEach trip takes 4 hours, so 6 trips take 6 trips * 4 hours/trip = 24 hours.  This is more than the 8 hours available, so we need to adjust the number of berries per trip.\nIf the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours, it will take 2 * 4 hours = 8 hours to complete the trips.  In 8 hours, it can collect 24 berries. This means each trip will yield 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries.\nI hope it is correct: 12 $berries$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.\nTo collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.\n#### 12"
