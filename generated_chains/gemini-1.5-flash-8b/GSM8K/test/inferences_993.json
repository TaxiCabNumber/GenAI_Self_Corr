At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?",
        "inference": "1. The second plane makes 44 trips.\n2. The first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane, so it makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.\n3. Three-quarters of the first plane's flights go to Greece, which is (3/4) * 88 = 66 trips.\n4. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, meaning there are 88 - 66 = 22 remaining trips.\n5. These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so there are 22 / 2 = 11 trips to France.\n\nI hope it is correct: 11 $flights$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.\nIf 3/4 of the first plane\u2019s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 \u2013 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.\nTherefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.\nSplitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.\n#### 11"
