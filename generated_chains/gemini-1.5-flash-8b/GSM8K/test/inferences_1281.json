At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDexter has five pigs. Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?",

Pigs per week: 40 pounds/feeding period * 7 days/week = 280 pounds/week\n4. Feed remaining: 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 $pounds$\n",
