At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?",
