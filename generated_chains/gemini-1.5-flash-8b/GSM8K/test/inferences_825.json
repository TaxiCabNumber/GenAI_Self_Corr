At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBecca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic Cards.  There is a total of 341 cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.  How many cards does Becca have?",
