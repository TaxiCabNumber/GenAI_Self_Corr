At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. How much will 8 pens cost?",
        "inference": "1. Cost of a pencil and eraser combined: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50\n2. Cost of one pen: $1.50\n3. Cost of 8 pens: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $12.00\n",
        "ground_truth": "A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.\nSo, 8 pens cost $1.50 x 8 = $<<8*1.5=12>>12.\n#### 12"
