His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?",

Distance per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year\n4. Cost per mile: $2/mile\n5. Cost for miles per year: 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000\n6. Monthly bonus: $150/month\n7. Weekly bonus: $150/month * 4 weeks/month = $600/week\n8. Weekly total cost: $600 + (300 miles * $2/mile) = $600 + $600 = $1200\n9. Yearly bonus: $600/week * 50 weeks/year = $30000\n10.
