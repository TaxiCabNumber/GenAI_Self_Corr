Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?",

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.\n4. The total fries taken by Kyle, Billy, and Colby is 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 fries.\n5. Griffin started with 24 fries and ended with 27 fries.\n6. The difference between the final and initial number of fries is 27 - 24 = 3 fries.\n7.
