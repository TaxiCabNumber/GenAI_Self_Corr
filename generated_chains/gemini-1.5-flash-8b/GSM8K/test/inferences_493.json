At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHeather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on sale for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?",
        "inference": "1. Two packs of razors, with a buy one get one free deal, means she gets 2 packs * 4 razors/pack + 2 packs * 0 razors/pack = 8 razors.\n\n2. The total cost of two packs at $4.00 per pack is 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00\n\n3. The coupon reduces the cost by $2.00, so the final cost is $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00\n\n4. The cost per razor is $6.00 / 8 razors = $0.75\n\n5. Converting to cents, $0.75 = 75 cents.\n\nI hope it is correct: 75$answer\n",
