At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA council met to vote on a new regulation. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of votes in favor of the new regulation?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the number of votes against the new regulation.\nThe number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so it is 2x.\nThe total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 3x.\nWe know the total number of people on the council is 33, so 3x = 33.\nSolving for x: x = 33 / 3 = 11.\nThe number of votes against the regulation is 11.\nThe number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22.\n\nI hope it is correct: 22 $\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.\nThere were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.\nThus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.\nTherefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.\n#### 22"
