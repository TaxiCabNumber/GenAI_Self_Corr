        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?",
        "inference": "1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.\n2. Half of what was left at the orange house is 5.  So, before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.\n3. She had 2 more at the red house than what she had at the orange house, which were 10. So she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before going to the orange house.\n4. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If 12 is 2/3 of what she started with, then (12 * 3) / 2 = 18 is the number of vacuum cleaners she started with.\n\nI hope it is correct: 18 $vacuum cleaners$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10\nThen add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12\nNow we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18\n#### 18"
