At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?",
        "inference": "1. Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons.\n2. 30% of 120 is (30/100) * 120 = 36 watermelons were ready for harvest initially.\n3. Ashlyn took 36 watermelons home.\n4. The remaining watermelons were 120 - 36 = 84.\n5. After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready.\n6. (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.\n7. The total watermelons harvested after two weeks were 36 + 63 = 99.\n8. The number of watermelons not ready for harvest after two weeks was 120 - 99 = 21.\n\nI hope it is correct: 21 $watermelons$\n",
