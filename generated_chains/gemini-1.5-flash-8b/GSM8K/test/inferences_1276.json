At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?",
        "inference": "1.  Find the perimeter of the rectangle:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n2.  Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet\nI hope it is correct: 70 $feet$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70"
