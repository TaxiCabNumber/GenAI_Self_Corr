They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?",

Convert total cleaning time to hours: 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours\n5. Total work hours per day: 8 hours\n6. Number of days: 5 days\n7. Total work hours for 5 days: 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours\n8. Percentage of cleaning time: (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100% = 50%\nI hope it is correct: 50%\n",
