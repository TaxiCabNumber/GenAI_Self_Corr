At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each and gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. How much will the seller give back in change?",
        "inference": "1. Cost of 5 phones: 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500\n\n2. Change: $4000 - $3500 = $500\n\nI hope it is correct: $500\n",
