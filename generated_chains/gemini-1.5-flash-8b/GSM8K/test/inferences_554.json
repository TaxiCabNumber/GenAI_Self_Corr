        "inference": "The problem states that the time to swim a mile in warm water is 16 + 2(2) = 20 minutes.  However, it assumes a constant rate of 2 minutes per mile *in warm water*. The problem also states the time to swim 3 miles in warm water is 20*3 = 60 minutes.\nThe time to swim 3 miles in cold water is 16 * 3 = 48 minutes, which means it takes 16 minutes per mile *in cold water*. This doesn't use the additional 2 minutes per mile in warm water.\n\nThe time to swim 3 miles in warm water is 16 minutes/mile + 2 minutes/mile * 2 miles, and the time is therefore (16+4)*3 = 60 minutes.\n\nThe time to swim 3 miles in cold water is 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.\n\n\nThe difference in time is 60 - 48 = 12 minutes.\n\n#### $12$\n",
