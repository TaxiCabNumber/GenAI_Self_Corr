At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAt a certain grade level, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, how many students are there at that grade level?",
        "inference": "1. If 3/4 have desktop computers, then 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 do not have desktop computers.\n2. If 1/4 of the students do not have desktop computers, and 20 students do not have desktop computers, then 20 students = 1/4 * total students.\n3. To find the total number of students, multiply both sides of the equation by 4: 20 * 4 = 1/4 * total students * 4\n4. 80 = total students\nI hope it is correct: 80 $students$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Twenty students represent 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the students at that level.\nSo, there are 4 x 20 students = <<4*20=80>>80 students at that level.\n#### 80"
