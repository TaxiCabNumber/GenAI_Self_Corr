At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% of the class are football players.  Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band.  These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away game.  How many students are leaving early?",
