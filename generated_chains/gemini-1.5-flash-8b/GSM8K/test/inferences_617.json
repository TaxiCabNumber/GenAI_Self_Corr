At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPrince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?",
