At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils.

Total boxes needed: Jam's boxes + Meg's pencils / pencils per box = 3 boxes + 46 pencils / 8 pencils/box = 3 boxes + 5.75 boxes.\n4. Since you can't have parts of a box, round up to the nearest whole number.\n5. Total boxes needed: 3 boxes + 6 boxes = 9 boxes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 9 $boxes$\n",
