At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend watching the show if he watches every episode?",
