At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?",
        "inference": "1. Kenny has $50 in spending cash, which, after buying a ticket to the amusement park for $100, he needs to make $150 in total.\n\n2. He keeps 1/3 of the cards, meaning he sells 2/3 of the cards.\n\n3.  Let 'x' be the total number of cards.  He sells (2/3)x cards for $1.5 each.  The amount he makes from selling cards is (2/3)x * $1.5 = $x.\n\n4.  The equation to solve is (2/3)x * $1.5 = $150\n\n5.  Simplifying, $x = \\frac{150}{\\frac{2}{3}\\times1.5} = \\frac{150}{1} = 150$\n\n6. The total number of cards Kenny started with is 225.\n\n7.  Checking: (2/3)*225 = 150 cards sold.  150 cards * $1.5/card = $225.  Kenny has $225 - $100 ticket = $125. This is incorrect.\n\n8. Solving for x again: \n   (2/3)x * $1.5 = $150\n   x = $150/ ($3/6)= $150 * 6/3 = $150 * 2 = 300\n\n9. Checking:\n   (2/3)*300 cards = 200 cards sold\n   200 * $1.5 = $300\n   $300 - $100 = $200 spending money\n\n10.Solving the final step:\n(2/3)x * 1.5=150\n   x = 150 / (1.5 *2/3)\n   x=150/1\n   x = 150\n   The number of cards he needs to sell to have $150 after spending $100 is 150 cards.\n  If he sells 150, and 2/3 of x = 150, then 2/3 x = 150 then x= 225\n\nI hope it is correct: 225 $answer$\n",
