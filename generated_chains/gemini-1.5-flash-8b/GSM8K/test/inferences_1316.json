At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?",
        "inference": "1. Discount on radiator: $400 * 0.80 = $320\n2. Mechanic cost: 3 hours * $50/hour = $150\n3. Total cost: $320 + $150 = $470\n\nI hope it is correct: $470\n",
        "ground_truth": "The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320\nSo he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80\nThe mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150\nSo in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230\n#### 230"
