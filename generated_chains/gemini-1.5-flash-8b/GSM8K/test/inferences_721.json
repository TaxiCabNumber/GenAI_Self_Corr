        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHelga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?",
        "inference": "Right foot taps per minute with arms down: 300\nLeft foot taps per minute with arms down: 250\nTotal taps per minute with arms down: 300 + 250 = 550\nRight foot taps per minute with arms up: 200\nLeft foot taps per minute with arms up: 200\nTotal taps per minute with arms up: 200 + 200 = 400\nMinutes with arms down: 5 - 2 = 3\nTotal taps with arms down: 550 taps/min * 3 min = 1650 taps\nTotal taps with arms up: 400 taps/min * 2 min = 800 taps\nCombined total taps: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps\nI hope it is correct: 2450 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.\nWith hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.\nWith hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.\nWith hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nWith hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nThus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times\n#### 2450"
