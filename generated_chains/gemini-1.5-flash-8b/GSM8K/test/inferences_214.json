At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?",
