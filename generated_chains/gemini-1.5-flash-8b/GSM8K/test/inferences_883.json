At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the usual concert runtime in minutes.\n2. The final concert is twice as long as usual, so its runtime is 2x minutes.\n3. The encore is 15 minutes.\n4. The total runtime of the final concert is the sum of the usual concert time, and the encore time: 2x + 15.\n5. We are given that the total runtime is 65 minutes, so 2x + 15 = 65.\n6. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50.\n7. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25.\n\nI hope it is correct: 25 $minutes$\n",
