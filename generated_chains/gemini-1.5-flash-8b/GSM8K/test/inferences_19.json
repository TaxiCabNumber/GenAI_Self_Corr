She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?",

Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours\n5. Desired average speed = 4 miles/hour\n6. Total time to complete the entire trail = Total distance / Desired average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles/hour = 3 hours\n7. Time needed to walk the remaining distance = Total time - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour\n8.
