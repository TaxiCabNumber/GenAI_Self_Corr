The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined weight of the two pennies?",

Find the combined weight:\n   Combined weight = weight of 2010 penny + weight of 1959 penny\n   Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains\n\nI hope it is correct: 84 $grains$\n",
