At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo raise money for their class fund, each of the 30 students from one class sold lollipops that cost $0.8 per lollypop. On average, each student sold 10 lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?",

Total cost of lollipops: 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollipop = $150\n\n4. Profit: $240 - $150 = $90\n\nI hope it is correct: $90\n",
        "ground_truth": "The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.\nSo each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.\nTherefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.\n#### 90"
