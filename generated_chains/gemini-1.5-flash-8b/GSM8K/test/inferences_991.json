At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nComet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?",
        "inference": "1. Let Bill's father's age when he saw the comet be 'x'.\n2. Bill's age when he saw the comet the first time = 30\n3. Comet's orbital period = 75 years\n4. Bill's age when he saw the comet the second time = 3x\n5. The time difference between the two sightings = 75 years.\n6.  So, 3x - 30 = 75n, where n is the number of cycles of the comet's orbit. \n7.  3x = 75n + 30\n8.  x = 25n + 10\n9.  Since x must be an integer representing his father's age, let's try values of n.\n10. If n = 1, x = 25(1) + 10 = 35.  Bill's age when he saw it the second time = 3(35) = 105. This works as 105 - 30 = 75 (1 orbit)\n11. If n = 0, x = 10. Bill's age when he saw it the second time = 3(10) = 30. The time difference is 0.\n\n12.  Therefore,  x = 35.\n13. Bill's father's age when he saw it first is 35.\n14. Bill's age when he saw it the first time = 30.\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $answer$\n",
