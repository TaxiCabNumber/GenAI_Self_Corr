At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia\u2019s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan\u2019s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?",
        "inference": "Octavia drinks half the recommended amount.  Let 'x' be the daily recommended amount. Octavia drinks x/2 cups.\nJuan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.\nJuan's doctor wants him to drink 4 cups.\nJuan needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups.\nSince we don't know the daily recommendation, we can't solve for a precise number of cups. However, we know that Juan has to reduce by 5x - 4 cups. If 'x'=8 cups, for instance, then Juan needs to reduce his intake by 5(8)-4 = 40 - 4 = 36 cups. But this was not the intent of the problem. The problem states the final amount recommended is 4 cups.\n\nJuan currently drinks 5x cups of coffee. The daily recommendation is 4 cups.  The difference is 5x - 4 cups.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5x-4 $cups$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups\nJuan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups\nSubtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan\u2019s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups\nJuan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups\n#### 16"
