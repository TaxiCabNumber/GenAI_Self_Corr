At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?",

Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44\n5. Profit per jar: $50 - $44 = $6\n6. Profit from 10 jars: $6/jar * 10 jars = $60\n\nI hope it is correct: $60\n",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12\nThe jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12\nThe honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20\nSo the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44\nSo the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6\nSo the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60\n#### 60"
