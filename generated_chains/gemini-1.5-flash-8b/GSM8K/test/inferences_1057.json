At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. If they watch movies every weekend, how many movies can they watch in 4 weeks?",
        "inference": "Movies on Saturday: 4\nMovies on Sunday: 4 / 2 = 2\nTotal movies per weekend: 4 + 2 = 6\nTotal movies in 4 weeks: 6 * 4 = 24\nI hope it is correct: 24 $movies$\n",
        "ground_truth": "They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.\nThey watch a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 movies every weekend.\nTherefore, they can watch 6 x 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 movies in four weeks.\n#### 24"
