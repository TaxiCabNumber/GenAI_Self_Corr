At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?",
