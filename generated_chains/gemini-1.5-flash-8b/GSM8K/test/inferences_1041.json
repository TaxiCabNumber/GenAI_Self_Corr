At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMolly is catering a birthday party for her sister and invited 16 people. 10 people want the chicken salad which is $6.50 per person and 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person. What is the total amount Molly will pay for the catering?",
