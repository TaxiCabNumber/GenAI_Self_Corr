They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?",

Each pen pal sends 2 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 10 pages/week.\n3. 3 pen pals * 10 pages/week/pen pal = 30 pages/week.\n4. 30 pages / (1 page / 6 minutes) = 180 minutes/week.\n5. 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours/week.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $hours$\n",
