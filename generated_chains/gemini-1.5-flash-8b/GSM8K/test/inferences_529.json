At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom bought a CD for $4, and a headphone set. In total, he paid $48. How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?",

Calculate how many CDs Tom could have bought with the headphone set's cost: $44 / $4 = 11 CDs\n3. Calculate the difference in CDs: 11 CDs - 1 CD = 10 CDs\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $CDs$\n",
