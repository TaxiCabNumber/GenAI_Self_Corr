The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost to paint the room?",

Calculate the total area to be painted: 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft\n4. Calculate the number of gallons of paint needed: 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons\n5.
