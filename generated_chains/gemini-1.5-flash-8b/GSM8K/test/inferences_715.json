At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.",
        "inference": "1. Original price per computer: $700\n2. Price increase: 10% of $700 = $70\n3. New price per computer: $700 + $70 = $770\n4. Total computers: 500\n5. Total cost: $770/computer * 500 computers = $385,000\n\nI hope it is correct: $385,000\n",
        "ground_truth": "When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70\nThe total buying price at the new prize is $700+$70 = $<<700+70=770>>770\nSince they wanted to buy 500 computers, they paid a total of $770*500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385000\n#### 385000"
