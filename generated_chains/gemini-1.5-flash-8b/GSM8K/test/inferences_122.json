        "inference": "Let's analyze the given information.\n\nMonday sleep: 8 hours\nTuesday sleep: 6 hours (8 - 2)\nWednesday sleep: 4 hours (6 - 2)\n\nThe pattern of decreasing sleep suggests a consistent decrease of 2 hours per day.  To correctly calculate the Thursday-Sunday average sleep, we need to determine how much sleep was lost on those days.\n\nThursday: 4 - 2 = 2 hours\nFriday: 2 - 2 = 0 hours\nSaturday: 0 - 2 = -2 hours\nSunday: -2 - 2 = -4 hours\n\nSleep cannot be negative. This indicates an error in the original problem statement, as a consistent sleep decrease is impossible to be carried out indefinitely.\n\nWe can assume Thursday-Sunday sleep hours follow a pattern similar to Monday-Wednesday but not including negative values.\n\n\nIf we assume the decrease in sleep continues, then Wednesday sleep would be 4 hours. The average Thursday-Sunday sleep must be derived by assuming a realistic sleep schedule.\n\nIf we assume 2 hours less sleep per day for each day from Monday-Wednesday, then each day from Thursday-Sunday would be 2 hours less sleep per day than the previous day.\nHowever, the Thursday - Sunday average sleep given is 5 hours, which is impossible to derive from the provided information.\n\nThe problem description is unclear about how the Thursday - Sunday average sleep is calculated.  There is a missing or erroneous piece of information.\n\nWithout further clarification, the problem cannot be solved.\n\n#### $Cannot be determined$\n",
