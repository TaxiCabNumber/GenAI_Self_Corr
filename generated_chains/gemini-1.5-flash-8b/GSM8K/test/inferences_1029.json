At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAs Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?",
        "inference": "1. Red balloons burst: 25 * 0.40 = 10 burst\n2. Remaining red balloons: 25 - 10 = 15\n3. Yellow balloons released: 12 / 2 = 6 released\n4. Remaining yellow balloons: 12 - 6 = 6\n5. Blue balloons added: 8 * 0.75 = 6 added\n6. Total balloons: 15 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 33\nI hope it is correct: 33 $balloons$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.\nBut 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.\nThe loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.\nShe added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.\nThus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons\n#### 34"
