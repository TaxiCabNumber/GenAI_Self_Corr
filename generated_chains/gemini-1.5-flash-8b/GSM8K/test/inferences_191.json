At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDucks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?",
        "inference": "1. Ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects per week.\n2. There are 7 days in a week.\n3. To find the daily insect requirement, divide the weekly requirement by the number of days in a week: 3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds/day\n4. There are 10 ducks.\n5. Multiply the daily requirement per duck by the number of ducks: 0.5 pounds/duck/day * 10 ducks = 5 pounds/day\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $pounds$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35\nThey need 5 pounds per day because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5"
