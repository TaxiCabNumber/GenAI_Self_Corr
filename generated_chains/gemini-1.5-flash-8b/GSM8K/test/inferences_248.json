At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA chef bought 4 bags of onions. Each bag weighs 50 pounds. A pound of onions cost $1.50. How much did the chef spend?",
        "inference": "1. Total weight of onions: 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds\n2. Total cost of onions: 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300\n\nI hope it is correct: $300\n",
        "ground_truth": "A bag of onions cost $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.\nTherefore, the chef spent $75 x 4 = $<<75*4=300>>300 for the four bags of onions.\n#### 300"
