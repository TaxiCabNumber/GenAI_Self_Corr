At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?",

Convert all coins to cents:\n   * 8 quarters = 8 * 25 cents = 200 cents\n   * 6 dimes = 6 * 10 cents = 60 cents\n   * 14 nickels = 14 * 5 cents = 70 cents\n   * 15 pennies = 15 * 1 cent = 15 cents\n\n2. Calculate the total value in cents:\n   Total cents = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents\n\n3. Calculate the number of gumballs:\n   Number of gumballs = Total cents / Cost per gumball = 345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs\n\nI hope it is correct: 69 $gumballs\n",
