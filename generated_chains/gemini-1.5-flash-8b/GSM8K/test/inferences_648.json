At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHowie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class as a special treat. He's not sure if people will want vanilla or chocolate cupcakes so he decides to get one of each for everyone. If he gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?",
