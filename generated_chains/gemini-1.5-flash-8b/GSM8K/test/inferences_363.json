At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?",
