At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRam uses a lot of pens. He discovered that he can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. If he buys 25 pens and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?",

He can mix 5 pens to make 1 new pen again.\n6. 30 pens / 5 pens/new pen = 6 new pens.\n7. He now has 30 + 6 = 36 pens.\n8. This process continues until he can no longer create new pens.\n9. The number of new pens will continue to be generated until the remaining number of pens is less than 5.\n\nThe pattern is:\n\nInitial pens = 25\nNew pens made from first batch = 25/5 = 5\nTotal pens after first mix = 25 + 5 = 30\nNew pens made from second batch = 30/5 = 6\nTotal pens after second mix = 30 + 6 = 36\n\nThe number of pens continues to increase until we have less than 5 pens left.\n\nContinuing the pattern:\n36/5 = 7.2\nWe round this down to 7.\n\nTotal pens = 36 + 7 = 43\nSince we have 25 pens to begin, and we are using 5 pens at a time to make a new pen, this process continues until there are fewer than 5 pens left.
