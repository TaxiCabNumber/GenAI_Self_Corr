At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height now?",
        "inference": "1. Xavier's height in inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.  Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.\n\n2. Cole's new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.\n\n3. Difference in height: 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let\u2019s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height is now 52 \u2013 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1"
