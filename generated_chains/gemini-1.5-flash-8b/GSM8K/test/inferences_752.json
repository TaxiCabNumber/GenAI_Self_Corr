At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJenna has 4 roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?",
        "inference": "1. Electricity bill per month: $100\n2. Number of roommates: 4\n3. Electricity share per roommate per month: $100 / 4 = $25\n4. Number of months in a year: 12\n5. Electricity share per roommate per year: $25 * 12 = $300\n\nI hope it is correct: $300\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.\nSince there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.\n#### 240"
