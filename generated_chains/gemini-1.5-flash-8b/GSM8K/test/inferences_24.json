At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50. This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book?",
        "inference": "Let the original price of the book be 'x'.\nThe discount is 25%, so the price Kyle paid is 75% of the original price.\n0.75 * x = $19.50\nx = $19.50 / 0.75\nx = $26.00\nI hope it is correct: $26.00\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.\nCombining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50\nDividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.\n#### 26"
