Calculate the total interest for the loan:\n   Interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n   Interest = $3650 * 0.10 * (5/12)  (5 months out of a year, which is 12)\n   Interest = $152.08\n\n2. Calculate the total amount to be repaid:\n   Total repayment = Principal + Interest\n   Total repayment = $3650 + $152.08 = $3802.08\n\n3.
