At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.
