At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAbraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?",

Another 1/4 of the land sold: 80 m\u00b2 * 1/4 = 20 m\u00b2\n   Money earned from second sale: 20 m\u00b2 * $30/m\u00b2 = $600\n\n3. Remaining land: 80 m\u00b2 - 40 m\u00b2 - 20 m\u00b2 = 20 m\u00b2\n   Money earned from third sale: 20 m\u00b2 * $3/m\u00b2 = $60\n\n4.
