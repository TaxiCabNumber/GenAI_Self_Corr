At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it.  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?",
        "inference": "1. Total weight = 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + (75 pounds * 2) (children) = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds\n\n2. Force needed = 1% of 1600 pounds = 0.01 * 1600 = 16 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 16 $pounds$\n",
        "ground_truth": "His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds\n#### 16"
