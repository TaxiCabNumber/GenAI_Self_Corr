At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this (smallest) group?",
