When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?",

Calculate the difference in daily revenue: $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day\n\n4. Calculate the percentage increase: ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 10%\n\nI hope it is correct: 10%\n",
