At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month.  How many tune-ups does he need in that time?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate total miles driven: 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles\n\n2. Divide total miles by miles per tune-up: 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $tune-ups$\n",
        "ground_truth": "He drives 100*30=<<100*30=3000>>3000 miles\nSo he needs 3000/1000=<<3000/1000=3>>3 tune-ups\n#### 3"
