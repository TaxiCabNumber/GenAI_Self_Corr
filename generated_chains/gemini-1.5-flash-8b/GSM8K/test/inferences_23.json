At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour that it burns. How many centimeters shorter will a candle be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total burning time.  From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle burns for 4 hours.\n\n2. Calculate the total shrinkage.  The candle shrinks 2 cm per hour, so in 4 hours it shrinks 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm.\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 $cm$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.\nThus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.\n#### 8"
