At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEach person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?",

Consumption per day: 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day\n5. Consumption per week: 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week\n6. Number of weeks the bag will last: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 weeks\n",
