At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?",
        "inference": "1. Cost per session: $25 + (10 students * $1.50/student) = $40\n\n2. Sessions per week: 3 days/week * 1 session/day = 3 sessions/week\n\n3. Sessions per month (assuming a 4-week month): 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month\n\n4. Total monthly earnings: 12 sessions/month * $40/session = $480\n\nI hope it is correct: $480\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480"
