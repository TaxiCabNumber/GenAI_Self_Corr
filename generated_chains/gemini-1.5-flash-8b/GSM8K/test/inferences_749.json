Calculate the number of groups needed for 54 students if there are to be 12 groups: 54 students / 12 groups = 4.5 students/group. Since you can't have half a student, this is not a possible arrangement.\n3. To get 12 groups of equal size, calculate the total number of students needed: 12 groups * 9 students/group = 108 students.\n4. Calculate the difference between the number of students needed and the actual number of students: 108 students - 54 students = 54 students.\n5.
