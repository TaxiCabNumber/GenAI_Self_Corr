At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSusan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?",

Earnings per 10 minutes: $5.\n5. Number of 10-minute intervals: 150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals.\n6. Total earnings: 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.\n\nI hope it is correct: $75\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75"
