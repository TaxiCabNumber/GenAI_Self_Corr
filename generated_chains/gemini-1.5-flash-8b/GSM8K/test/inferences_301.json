        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. How many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 16 $pieces$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each piece prints 4 pages.\nThen 32/4=<<32/4=8>>8 pieces of paper would be used.\n#### 8"
