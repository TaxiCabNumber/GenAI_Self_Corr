At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?",

Initial total cost for 5 years: $6/year * 5 years = $30\n5. Cost increase: 150% of $2 = $2 * 1.5 = $3\n6. Increased cost per visit: $2 + $3 = $5\n7. Visits after increase: 3 visits/year\n8.
