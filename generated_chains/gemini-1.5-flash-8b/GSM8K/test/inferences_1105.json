How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?",

Calculate the total savings needed for retirement: $40,000/year * 20 years = $800,000\n4. Calculate the remaining savings needed: $800,000 - ($20,000/year * x years) = $0\n5. Solve for x (number of years): $800,000 = $20,000 * x\n   x = 40 years\n6.
