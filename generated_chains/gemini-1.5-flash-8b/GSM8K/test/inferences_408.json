At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nToby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?",

Total time spent before leaving: 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes\n4. Time left before departure: 60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 $minutes$\n",
