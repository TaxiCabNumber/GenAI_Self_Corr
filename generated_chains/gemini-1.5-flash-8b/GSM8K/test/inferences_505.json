He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?",

This yields 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.\n\nWith $24, we can buy a maximum of $24 / $6 = 4 2x8 boards.  This yields 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.\n\nComparing the two, 1600 is greater than 1200, so the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is with the 2x8 boards.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1600 $sticks$\n",
