At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nYou can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?",
        "inference": "1.  Let 'p' be the regular price of popcorn.\n2.  The cost of a movie ticket + popcorn + soda without the super ticket is $12 + p + $3 = $15 + p\n3.  The cost of a movie ticket + popcorn + soda with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21\n4.  You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so $15 + p = $21 - $2 = $19\n5.  Solving for p: $p = $19 - $15 = $4\n\nI hope it is correct: $4\n",
