At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.",

        "ground_truth": "If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000\nSince the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000\n#### 240000"
