At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMy mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. How much money did my mom spend at the gardening shop?",
        "inference": "1. Pots cost: $19\n2. Soil cost: $26\n3. Total cost before coupon: $19 + $26 = $45\n4. Coupon discount: -$7\n5. Total cost after coupon: $45 - $7 = $38\n\nI hope it is correct: $38\n",
