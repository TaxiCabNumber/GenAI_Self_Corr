At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?",
        "inference": "1. **Extra class time:** 2 classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes\n2. **Daily class time:** 6 periods * 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes\n3. **Weekly class time:** 240 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1200 minutes\n4. **Total weekly learning time (class + extra):** 1200 minutes + 80 minutes = 1280 minutes\n5. **Saturday/Sunday learning time:** 1280 minutes * (1/16) = 80 minutes\n6. **Total weekly learning time:** 1280 minutes + 80 minutes = 1360 minutes\n7. **Convert to hours:** 1360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 22.6666... hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 22.67 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday\nSo he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week\nSo he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week\n#### 30"
