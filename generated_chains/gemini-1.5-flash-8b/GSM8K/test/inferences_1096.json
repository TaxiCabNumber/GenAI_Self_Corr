He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help?

People helped per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day\n5. Total people helped: 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people\n\nI hope it is correct: 240 $people$\n",
