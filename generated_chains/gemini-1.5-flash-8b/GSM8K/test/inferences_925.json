At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?",

In 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.\n\n4. The remaining water in the tank after 6 days is 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 2000 $gallons$\n",
