At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGenerally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
