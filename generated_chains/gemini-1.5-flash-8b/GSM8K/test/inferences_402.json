At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?",

Milk: 1 cup/batch * 4 batches = 4 cups of milk\n5. Milk bottles: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles\n6. Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 bags\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $bags$\n",
