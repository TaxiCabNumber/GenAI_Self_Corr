At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaterina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?",
        "inference": "1. Topaz gemstone length: 1 inch\n2. Sterling silver bead length: 1/4 inch\n3. Total necklace length: 25 inches\n4. Total topaz length: 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches\n5. Total sterling silver bead length: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches\n6. Sterling silver beads per inch: 1 bead / (1/4 inch) = 4 beads/inch\n7. Total sterling silver beads: 17 inches * 4 beads/inch = 68 beads\n\nI hope it is correct: 68 $beads$\n",
        "ground_truth": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68"
