        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the volume of the jar: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches\n\n2. Calculate the volume available for jelly beans, considering 80% efficiency: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches\n\n3. Calculate the number of total jelly beans that can fit: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans\n\n4. Calculate the number of red jelly beans according to Tim's estimate: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans\n\n5. Calculate the difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans: 900 - 864 = 36\n\nI hope it is correct: 36 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches\nThat means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans\nWith 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there\nSo that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red\nSo his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36\n#### 36"
