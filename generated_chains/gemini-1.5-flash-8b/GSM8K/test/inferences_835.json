        "inference": "Let's assume the distance is constant.  The problem states that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours. This means the work done by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is 54 kangaroo-hours.\n\nIf a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it takes twice as long to cover the same distance.\n\nIf 4 turtles are working, each turtle takes 2 * 18 = 36 hours.  So 4 turtles take 36 hours to complete the job.\n\nTo complete the same distance, the 4 turtles will need 54 kangaroo-hours / (4 turtles * 18 kangaroo-hours / turtle) = 54/72 = 0.75 turtle-hours.\n\n#### $0.75$\n",
