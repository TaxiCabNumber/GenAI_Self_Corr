This is incorrect. It states Emil's *future* age, not his current age.\n\n\n2. Emil's age is half his dad's age. Emil is currently 19.  His dad is currently 19 * 2 = 38 years old. This is correct.\n\n\n3. Emil is twice his brother's age when Emil is 24. So Emil's brother is 24 / 2 = 12 years old. This is correct.\n\n\n4. Emil's brother is currently 12 - (24 - 19) = 12 - 5 = 7 years old. This is incorrect, as it assumes Emil's brother is 12 at a time in the future.\n\n\nNow, we calculate the correct brother's age:\n\n* Emil is 19, and his brother is 12 - 7 years = 7 years old.\n\n* Emil is currently 19, and when Emil is 24, the age difference is 24 - 19 = 5 years.
