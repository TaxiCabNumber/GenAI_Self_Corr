After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",

        "ground_truth": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.\nDivide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets\n#### 5"
