At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA nurses\u2019 station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?",
        "inference": "1. First day: Used 38 bandages, ordered 50. Total bandages = 38 + 50 = 88.\n\n2. Second day: Used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.\n\n3. Third day: Ordered 2 packs (2 * 50 = 100 bandages). Used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.\n\n4. Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.\n\n5. Total bandages = 88 + 100 - 91 = 97 bandages.\n\n6. Bandages left = 78. Therefore, total bandages = 78 + 91 = 169.\n\n7. Bandages they started with on the first day = 169 - 100 = 69 bandages.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 69 $bandages$\n",
