At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe caretaker of the docks needs to buy some new line. He wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there is 200 feet of dock, and he has 6 feet of new line. How many feet of line does he need to buy in total?",
