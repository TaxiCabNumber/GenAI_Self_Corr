At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nApril is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. They ask for 30 plant pots for the daisies, and twice as many for the roses. April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?",
        "inference": "1. Pots for roses: 30 daisies * 2 = 60 rose pots\n2. Total pots needed: 30 daisies + 60 roses = 90 pots\n3. Pots left over: 100 initial pots - 90 needed pots = 10 pots\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.\nThis means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.\nSo in total, Alice has 100 \u2013 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.\n#### 10"
