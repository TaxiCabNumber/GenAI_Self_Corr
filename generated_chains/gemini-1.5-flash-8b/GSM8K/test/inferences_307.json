At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?",
