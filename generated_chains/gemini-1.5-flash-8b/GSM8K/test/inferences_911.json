At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nColby works for a manufacturing company in the packaging division.  He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, how much money, in dollars, does he earn in a typical eight-hour workday?",
