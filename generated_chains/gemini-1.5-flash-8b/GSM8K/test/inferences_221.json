At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank now?",
        "inference": "1. Water left in the tank after Celine used some: 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters.\n2. Rainwater collected: 30 liters * 2 = 60 liters.\n3. Total water in the tank now: 30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters.\n\nI hope it is correct: 90 $answer$\n",
