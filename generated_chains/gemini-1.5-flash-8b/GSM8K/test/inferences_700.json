At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?",

Fireworks from Hannah's backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks\n4. Total fireworks Hannah sees: 120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks\n\nI hope it is correct: 135 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks\nThen multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks\nThen find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks\nThen add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks\n#### 135"
