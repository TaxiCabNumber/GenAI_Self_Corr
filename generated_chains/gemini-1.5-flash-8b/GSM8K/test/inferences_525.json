At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHeather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",
        "inference": "1. **Find the total amount of raisins for each part:**  Heather divides the 27 cups of raisins equally among 3 parts (cookies, granola, and snack mix).  27 cups / 3 parts = 9 cups per part.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of batches of cookies:**  Each batch of cookies uses 3/4 cup of raisins.  Divide the raisins per part (9 cups) by the amount per batch (3/4 cup): 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 9 * (4/3) batches = 12 batches.\n\nI hope it is correct: 12 $batches$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12"
