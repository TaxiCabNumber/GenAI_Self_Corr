At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSam sells bread. He has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. One week he was closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and Thursday 18 crates. By how many crates was Sam off from his target for the week?",

Calculate the difference between the target and the actual sales: 120 - 65 = 55 crates\n3. Since Sam was off his target by 55 crates, the answer is 55.\n\nI hope it is correct: 55 crates\n",
