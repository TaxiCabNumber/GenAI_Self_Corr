She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?",

Cards kept: 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards\n5. Students' cards: 300 cards\n6. Students per student: 10 cards\n7. Number of students: 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $students$\n",
