At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?",
        "inference": "1. Let the number of cases for the second house be 'x'.\n2. The first house needs 1/2 of the second, so it needs (1/2)x cases.\n3. The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2 * (1/2)x = x cases.\n4. The total cases are 250, so (1/2)x + x + x = 250.\n5. Combining like terms, (3.5)x = 250.\n6. Solving for x, x = 250 / 3.5 = 71.42857...\n7. Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 71.\n8. The third house needs 'x' cases, which is 71.\n\nI hope it is correct: 71 $cases$\n",
