At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?",
        "inference": "1. Sandwiches needed: 20 people / 4 people/sandwich = 5 sandwiches\n\n2. Meat needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds\n\n3. Cheese needed: 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds\n\n4. Cost of meat: 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00\n\n5. Cost of cheese: 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00\n\n6. Total cost: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $50.00\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches\n1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat\n1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese\nWhen you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00\n#### 50"
