        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nErika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?",

        "ground_truth": "Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 \u2013 $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.\nWe know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 \u2013 $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.\nSome of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 \u2013 $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.\nSubtracting her part-time wages shows that she had $270 \u2013 $150 = $<<270-150=120>>120 in her purse.\n#### 120"
