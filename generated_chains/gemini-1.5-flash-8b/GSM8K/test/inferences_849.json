At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer has 900 eggs. He placed them on a tray, which holds 30 eggs each. How much will the farmer earn if he sells it for $2.5 per tray?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of trays: 900 eggs / 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays\n\n2. Calculate the total earnings: 30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75\n\nI hope it is correct: $75\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 900 / 30 = <<900/30=30>>30 trays that hold 900 eggs.\nSo, the farmer will earn 30 x $2.5 = $<<30*2.5=75>>75 if he sells it per tray.\n#### 75"
