At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEllen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left. Ellen's brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, then Ellen's friend came along. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?",

        "ground_truth": "First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.\nNext, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.\nThen figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.\nNow add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas\nNow divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25\nNow multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%\n#### 25"
