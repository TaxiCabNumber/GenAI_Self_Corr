At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPeter plans to go to the movies this week. He always gets a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. If he has 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?",
        "inference": "1. Total cost per movie trip: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14\n2. Number of movie trips: $42 (total money) / $14 (cost per trip) = 3\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 trips\n",
        "ground_truth": "It costs him $14 to go to the movies because 7 + 7 = <<7+7=14>>14\nHe can go to the movies 3 times because 42 / 14 = <<42/14=3>>3\n#### 3"
