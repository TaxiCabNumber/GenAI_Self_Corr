At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLarry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?",
        "inference": "Females ate 3 dumplings each, and there are 6 females, so they ate 3 * 6 = 18 dumplings.\nMales ate 1 more than females, so they ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings each.\nThere are 8 males, so they ate 4 * 8 = 32 dumplings.\nTotal dumplings eaten is 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.\nLarry cooked 50 dumplings.\nI hope it is correct: 50\n",
        "ground_truth": "So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.\nHence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.\nThe 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.\nSo, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.\n#### 50"
