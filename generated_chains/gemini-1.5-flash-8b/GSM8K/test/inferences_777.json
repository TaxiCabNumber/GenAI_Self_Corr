        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?",
        "inference": "1. Series movies: 600 movies * (1/3) = 200 movies\n   Cost of series movies: 200 movies * $6 = $1200\n\n2. Remaining movies: 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies\n\n3. Older movies: 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies\n   Cost of older movies: 160 movies * $5 = $800\n\n4. Normal movies: 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies\n   Cost of normal movies: 240 movies * $10 = $2400\n\n5. Total cost: $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400\n\nI hope it is correct: $4400\n",
