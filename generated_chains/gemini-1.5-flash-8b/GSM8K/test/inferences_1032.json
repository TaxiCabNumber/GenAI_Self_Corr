At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrandpa loves to eat jelly beans, but how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the size of the beans.  It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.  And eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.  How many small beans can Grandpa eat?",

Total small beans equivalent to medium beans: 150 medium beans * 3 small beans/medium bean = 450 small beans\n\nI hope it is correct: 450 $answer$\n",
