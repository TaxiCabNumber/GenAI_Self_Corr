At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMilo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?",
        "inference": "1. Chips per square inch: 12 chips/in\u00b2\n2. Chips per bag: 72 chips/bag\n3. Total chips from two bags: 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips\n4. Area of mosaic in square inches: 144 chips / 12 chips/in\u00b2 = 12 in\u00b2\n5. Height of mosaic: 3 inches\n6. Length of mosaic: Area / height = 12 in\u00b2 / 3 inches = 4 inches\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $inches$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.\nWith those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nThus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\n#### 4"
