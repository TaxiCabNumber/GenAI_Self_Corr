At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?",
        "inference": "1. Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.  This is a 17-hour stay.\n\n2. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.\n\n3. The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.\n\n4. Total cost using the hourly option: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.\n\n5. The 24-hour option costs 1600 pesos.\n\n6. Cameron would save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.\n\nI hope it is correct: 250 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250"
