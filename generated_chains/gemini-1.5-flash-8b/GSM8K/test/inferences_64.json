At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
        "inference": "1.  Sophia's car holds 12 gallons of gas.\n2.  She used 4 gallons to fill up.\n3.  This means she has 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons available for driving.\n4.  She drove 100 miles on the 4 gallons.\n5.  This means that for every 4 gallons, she drives 100 miles.\n6. To calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:\n    (12 gallons / 4 gallons) * 100 miles = 300 miles\nI hope it is correct: 300 $miles$\n",
        "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300"
