At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.  After the movie is done the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done.  How much did Jean pay?",
        "inference": "1. Makeup cost per day: $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500\n2. Makeup cost per week: $1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000\n3. Makeup cost for the movie: $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000\n4. Discount amount: $30000 * 0.10 = $3000\n5. Total amount paid after discount: $30000 - $3000 = $27000\n\nI hope it is correct: $27000\n",
        "ground_truth": "Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day\nSo he pays 1500*4=$<<1500*4=6000>>6000 a week\nSo the work cost 6000*5=$<<6000*5=30000>>30,000\nThey give a discount of 30,000*.1=$<<30000*.1=3000>>3000\nSo the total cost paid is 30,000-3000=$<<30000-3000=27000>>27,000\n#### 27000"
