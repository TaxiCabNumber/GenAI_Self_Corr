At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFaraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?",

Total sunflowers from bouquets per day: 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers\n4. Total sunflowers per day: 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers\n5. Total sunflowers after 3 days: 97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers\n\nI hope it is correct: 291 sunflowers\n",
