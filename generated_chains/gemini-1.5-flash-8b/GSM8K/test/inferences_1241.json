She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?",

        "ground_truth": "Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.\nFive dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.\nSo there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.\nThus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.\nTherefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.\n#### 8"
