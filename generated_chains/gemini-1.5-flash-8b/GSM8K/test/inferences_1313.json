At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?",
        "inference": "1. Cost per watermelon: $80 / 50 = $1.60\n\n2. Profit per watermelon: $1.60 * 0.25 = $0.40\n\n3. Selling price per watermelon: $1.60 + $0.40 = $2.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $2.00\n",
        "ground_truth": "The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.\nSo, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.\n#### 2"
