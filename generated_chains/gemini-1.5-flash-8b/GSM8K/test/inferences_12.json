At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the initial cost: $90\n\n2. Calculate the annual growth: 7 lemons/year\n\n3. Calculate the annual sales revenue: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year\n\n4. Calculate the annual expenses: $3/year\n\n5. Calculate the annual profit: $10.50/year - $3/year = $7.50/year\n\n6. Calculate the years it takes to recover the initial cost: $90 / $7.50/year = 12 years\n\nI hope it is correct: 12 $years$\n",
        "ground_truth": "He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5\nHe earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5\nIt will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12\nHe will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13\n#### 13"
