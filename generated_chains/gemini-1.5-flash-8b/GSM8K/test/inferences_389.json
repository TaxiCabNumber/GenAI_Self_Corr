At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDavid and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.  You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?",

        "ground_truth": "Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nAll 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.\nBy bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.\n#### 6"
