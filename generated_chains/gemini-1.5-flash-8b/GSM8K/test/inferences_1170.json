At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?",
        "inference": "1. Red, white, and purple paint are equal, so they each take up 1/3 of the non-yellow portion of the mural.\n2. The non-yellow portion is 1/2 of the mural.\n3. So, red, white, and purple each take up (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6 of the mural.\n4. Since the mural uses 12 pints total, and yellow takes up 1/2, the non-yellow portion uses 12 pints * (1/2) = 6 pints\n5. Red, white, and purple each use 6 pints * (1/3) = 2 pints.\nI hope it is correct: 2 $pints$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.\nThe mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.\n#### 2"
