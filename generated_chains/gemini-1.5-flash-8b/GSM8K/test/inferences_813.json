At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?",
