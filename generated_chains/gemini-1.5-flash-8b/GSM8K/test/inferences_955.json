At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",

Patients admitted in 2 weeks (14 days): 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients\n5. Total beds occupied after 2 weeks: 200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds\n6.
