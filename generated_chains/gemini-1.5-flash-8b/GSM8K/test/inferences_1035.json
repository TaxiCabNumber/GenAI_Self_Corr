At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRichard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of bottles: 24 feet / 3 feet/bottle = 8 bottles\n2. Calculate the total time: 8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds\n\nI hope it is correct: 40 $seconds$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.\nIf Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.\n#### 35"
