At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?",

Total time per week: 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week\n6. Total time in 4 weeks: 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 36 $hours$\n",
