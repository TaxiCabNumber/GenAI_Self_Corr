At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA tank of water has a depth of 17 feet on Monday. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. What is the tank\u2019s water depth on Wednesday?",
