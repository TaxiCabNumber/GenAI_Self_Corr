At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?",

Flour for tomorrow: 30 cookies / 12 cookies/cup = 2.5 cups\n6. Total flour: 3 cups + 2.5 cups = 5.5 cups\n\nI hope it is correct: 5.5 $cups$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.\nSince 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.\nHence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.\n#### 11"
