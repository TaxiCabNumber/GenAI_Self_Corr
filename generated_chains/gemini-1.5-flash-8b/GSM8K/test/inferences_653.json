At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally\u2019s wage?",

Subtract the expected wage from the net increase to find the amount withheld: $220 - $300 = -$80.\n4. The negative sign indicates that the amount withheld is -$80.
