At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
        "inference": "1. King Cab upgrade cost: $7,500\n2. Leather seats cost: (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500\n3. Running boards cost: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000\n4. Total cost of extra features: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500\n5. Total cost of the truck: $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500\n\nI hope it is correct: 43500 $answer\n",
        "ground_truth": "The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.\nThe running boards are $500 less than the leather seats at a cost of $2500-$500=$2000\nThe total cost of the truck is $30,000+$7500+$2500+$2000+$1500=$<<30000+7500+2500+2000+1500=43500>>43,500\n#### 43,500"
