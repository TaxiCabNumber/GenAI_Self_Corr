At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?",
        "inference": "2300 people * 1 = 2300 daily energy needs\n2300 daily energy needs / 0.20 = 11500 bottles needed\n11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles\n\nI hope it is correct: 7300 $bottles$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.\nSo 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.\nTo cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.\n#### 7300"
