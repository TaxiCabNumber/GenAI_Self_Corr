At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?",
