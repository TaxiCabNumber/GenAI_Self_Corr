At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBilly sells DVDs. He has 8 customers on Tuesday. His first 3 customers buy one DVD each.  His next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each.  His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?",
