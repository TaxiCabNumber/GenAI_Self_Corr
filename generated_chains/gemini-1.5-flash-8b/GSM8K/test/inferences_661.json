At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRoger goes to the store to buy some coffee.  The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out.  He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day.  He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2.  How much did everything cost?",
        "inference": "1. Increased cost per pound: $5 * 1.20 = $6\n2. Cost of coffee for a week: $6/pound * 7 pounds = $42\n3. Total cost: $42 + $2 = $44\n\nI hope it is correct: $44\n",
        "ground_truth": "The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 5+1=$<<5+1=6>>6 per pound\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 pounds of coffee a week\nSo he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee\nThat means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44\n#### 44"
