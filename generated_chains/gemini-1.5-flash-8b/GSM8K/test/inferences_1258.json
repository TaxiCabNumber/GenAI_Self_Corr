At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the whole phone plan cost?",
        "inference": "1. The main phone costs $20.\n2. Each additional phone costs half of the main phone cost, which is $20 / 2 = $10.\n3. There are 5 phones in total, so there are 4 additional phones.\n4. The cost of the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.\n5. The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.\n\nI hope it is correct: $60\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.\nThus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.\nThus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.\n#### 60"
