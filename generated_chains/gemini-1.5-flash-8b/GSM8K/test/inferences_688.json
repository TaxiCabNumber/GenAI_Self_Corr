At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn is very tired. He decides to take a nap, but he wants to finish his homework first. If John has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework and 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, how many minutes does John have to nap?",

Calculate total homework time: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes\n\n3. Calculate time available for nap: 180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 $minutes$\n",
