At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.00 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?",
