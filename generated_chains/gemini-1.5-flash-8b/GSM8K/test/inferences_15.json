At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA merchant wants to make a choice of purchase between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?",
        "inference": "Jewelry profit: $5000 * 0.025 = $125\nGadgets profit: $8000 * 0.012 = $96\n\nI hope it is correct: $96\n",
        "ground_truth": "If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125\nIf he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96\nIf he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125\n#### 125"
