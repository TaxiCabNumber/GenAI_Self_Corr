At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLuke is buying fabric for new curtains. There are five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide and Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. How much fabric should he buy?",
