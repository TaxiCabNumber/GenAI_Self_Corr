At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLinus works for a trading company. He buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. If he bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, how much profit was he able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday?",
