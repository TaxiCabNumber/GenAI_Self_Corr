At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA landscaping company is delivering flagstones to a customer\u2019s yard. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. If the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, how many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones: 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds\n\n2. Divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of each truck: 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 trucks\n",
        "ground_truth": "The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.\nThus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.\n#### 3"
