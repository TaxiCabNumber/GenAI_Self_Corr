At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He\u2019s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",

Remaining amount to pay: $4500 - $600 = $3900\n6. Number of hours to work: $3900 / $15/hour = 260 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 260 $hours$\n",
