At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAriadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.",

Sales in the second month = ($1200) * (3/4) = $900\n5. Total sales in two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100\n\nI hope it is correct: $2100\n",
