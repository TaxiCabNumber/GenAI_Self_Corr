At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?",

This means A = 2V.\nVanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so V' = 2A'.\nVanessa ran 4 miles, so V' = 4.\nThis implies 2A' = 4, which means A' = 2 miles.\nIf Aaron ran 2 miles, and his time was 16 minutes, his speed is A = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 1/8 mile/minute.\nSince A = 2V, we have 1/8 = 2V, so V = 1/16 mile/minute.\nVanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1/16 mile/minute.  Time taken = distance / speed.\nTime = 4 miles / (1/16 mile/minute) = 4 * 16 minutes = 64 minutes.\nI hope it is correct: 64 $minutes$\n",
