A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing, and a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the first two kinds of beds. How many pounds of stuffing does Mark need to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds?",

Calculate the stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds.\n   4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds\n\n3. Calculate the stuffing needed for 3 collie beds.\n   3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds\n\n4. Add the stuffing needed for both types of beds.\n   8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 23 $pounds$\n",
