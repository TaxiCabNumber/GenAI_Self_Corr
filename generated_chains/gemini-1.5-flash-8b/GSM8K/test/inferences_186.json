At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRussell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?",
        "inference": "1. Rats: 3 cages * x rats/cage = 3x rats\n   Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so total straw for rats = 3x * 6 = 18x\n2. Hamsters: 10 cages * y hamsters/cage = 10y hamsters\n   Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so total straw for hamsters = 10y * 5 = 50y\n3. Rabbits: 20 pieces of straw\n4. Total straw = 18x + 50y + 20 = 160\n5. Straw for rats and hamsters = 160 - 20 = 140\n   18x + 50y = 140\n6.
