At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCandice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?",
        "inference": "1. Notes initially: 80\n2. Notes on cups: 220\n3. Total notes used: 80 + 220 = 300\n4. Notes remaining: 23\n5. Notes in package: Total notes used - initial notes + remaining notes = 300 - 80 + 23 = 243\n\nI hope it is correct: 243 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.\nThen, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.\nAnd if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23\nSubtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.\n#### 163"
