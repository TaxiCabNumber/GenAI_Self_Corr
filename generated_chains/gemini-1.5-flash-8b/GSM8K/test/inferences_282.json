At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?",
