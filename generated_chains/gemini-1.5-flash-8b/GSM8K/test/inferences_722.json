At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRon is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?",
        "inference": "1. Cost of damage to Ron's car: $450\n2. Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120\n3. Cost of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75\n4. Total cost of fixing the pothole: $120 + $75 = $195\n5. Amount saved by fixing the pothole: $450 - $195 = $255\n\nI hope it is correct: $255\n",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75\nNow subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255\n#### 255"
