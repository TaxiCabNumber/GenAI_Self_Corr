There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and there are twice as many babies as queens.  How many worker bees are there?",

There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so there are 2 * 2x = 4x worker bees.\n4. The total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees: x + 2x + 4x = 700\n5. Combining like terms: 7x = 700\n6. Solving for x: x = 700 / 7 = 100\n7. The number of worker bees is 4x, so 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.\n\nI hope it is correct: 400\n",
