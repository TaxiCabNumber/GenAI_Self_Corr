At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A, some to District B and 209 newspapers to District C. How many newspapers does he deliver to District B?",
