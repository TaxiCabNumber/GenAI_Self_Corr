At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hay farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month last year. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres of grass. If the farmer also owns 9 horses and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, how many bales of hay would the farmer have left by the end of December if he starts feeding them this year's hay beginning the first day of September?",
        "inference": "1. **Hay per acre this year:** 560 bales / 5 acres = 112 bales/acre\n2. **Total acres this year:** 5 acres + 7 acres = 12 acres\n3. **Total hay this year:** 112 bales/acre * 12 acres = 1344 bales\n4. **Days in September:** 30 days\n5. **Days in October:** 31 days\n6. **Days in November:** 30 days\n7. **Days in December:** 31 days\n8. **Total days from September 1st to December 31st:** 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days\n9. **Total hay consumed by horses:** 9 horses * 3 bales/horse/day * 122 days = 3294 bales\n10. **Hay remaining:** 1344 bales - 3294 bales = -1950 bales\n\nI hope it is correct: -1950 bales\n",
