At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEve wants to buy her 3 nieces cooking gear that's made for kids.  The hand mitts cost $14.00 and the apron is $16.00.  A set of 3 cooking utensils is $10.00 and a small knife is twice the amount of the utensils.  The store is offering a 25% off sale on all cooking gear.  How much will Eve spend on the gifts?",
