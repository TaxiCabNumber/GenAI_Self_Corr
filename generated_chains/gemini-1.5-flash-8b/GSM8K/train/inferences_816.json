At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMatt needs to buy new plates for his home.  He only wants to do dishes once a week.  Three days a week it is only him and his son eating and they use 1 plate each.  On the remainder of the days, his parents join them and everyone uses 2 plates that day.  How many plates does he need to buy?",
