At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo let Ruth know how long her fish will live, her father tells her that well-cared fish can live 2 years longer than dogs live. On average, dogs live 4 times as long as hamsters live. And hamsters live an average of 2.5 years. How long can a fish live?",
        "inference": "Hamsters live 2.5 years.\nDogs live 4 times as long as hamsters, so dogs live 4 * 2.5 = 10 years.\nFish live 2 years longer than dogs, so fish live 10 + 2 = 12 years.\nI hope it is correct: 12 $years$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Knowing that dogs live 4 times the age of hamsters, dogs live 4 * 2.5 = <<4*2.5=10>>10 years.\nIf Ruth takes care of the fish, it can live 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12 years.\n#### 12"
