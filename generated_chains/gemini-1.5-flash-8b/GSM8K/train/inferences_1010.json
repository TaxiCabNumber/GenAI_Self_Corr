At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nErin works in the school cafeteria serving soup. Each bowl of soup has 10 ounces, and Erin can serve 5 bowls per minute. If the pot of soup has 6 gallons of soup, how long will it take Erin to serve all the soup, rounded to the nearest minute? (There are 128 ounces to a gallon.)",
        "inference": "1. Convert gallons to ounces: 6 gallons * 128 ounces/gallon = 768 ounces\n\n2. Calculate the total number of bowls: 768 ounces / 10 ounces/bowl = 76.8 bowls\n\n3. Round up to the nearest whole bowl: 77 bowls\n\n4. Calculate the time in minutes: 77 bowls / 5 bowls/minute = 15.4 minutes\n\n5. Round to the nearest minute: 15 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 15 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First find the number of ounces Erin serves per minute: 10 ounces/bowl * 5 bowls/minute = <<10*5=50>>50 ounces/minute\nThen find the number of ounces in the pot: 6 gallons * 128 ounces/gallon = <<6*128=768>>768 ounces\nThen divide the total amount of soup by the amount of soup Erin serves per minute: 768 minutes / 50 ounces/minute = <<768/50=15.36>>15.36 minutes, which rounds down to 15 minutes\n#### 15"
