At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBased on a 2008 study, children 6\u201311 years old spend 45 minutes each day watching television. How many hours do these children watch television in 2 weeks if they are allowed to watch television 4 days a week?",
        "inference": "45 minutes/day * 4 days/week = 180 minutes/week\n180 minutes/week * 2 weeks = 360 minutes\n360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 6 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The children watch a total of 45 x 4 = <<45*4=180>>180 minutes in a week.\nIn hours, this is equal to 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours a week.\nThus, these children watch 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours in two weeks.\n#### 6"
