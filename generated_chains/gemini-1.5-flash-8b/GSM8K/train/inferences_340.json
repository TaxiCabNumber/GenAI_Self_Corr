At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?",

Calculate the effective length after lashing: 20 feet * (1 - 0.25) = 20 feet * 0.75 = 15 feet\n\n3. Calculate the number of pieces needed: 60 feet / 15 feet/piece = 4 pieces\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $pieces$\n",
