At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPorche has 3 hours to get all her homework done. Her math homework takes her 45 minutes. Her English homework takes her 30 minutes. Her science homework takes her 50 minutes. Her history homework takes her 25 minutes. She also has a special project due the next day. How much time does she have left to get that project done?",

Calculate the time remaining: 3 hours - 2.5 hours = 0.5 hours\n\n4. Convert the remaining time to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $minutes$\n",
