At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate Gary's regular pay for 40 hours: 40 hours * $12/hour = $480\n\n2. Calculate the overtime pay amount: $696 (total pay) - $480 (regular pay) = $216\n\n3. Calculate the overtime hours: $216 / ($12/hour * 1.5) = 12 hours\n\n4. Calculate the total hours worked: 40 hours (regular) + 12 hours (overtime) = 52 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 52 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.\nThis means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.\nHis overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.\nSo Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.\nSo in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = <<40+12=52>>52 hours that week.\n#### 52"
