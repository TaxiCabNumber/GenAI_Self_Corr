At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTJ ran a 10K race last Saturday. He ran the first half in 20 minutes. He completed the second half in 30 minutes. What was his average time per kilometer?",
        "inference": "1. Total distance = 10 km\n2. Time for first half = 20 minutes\n3. Time for second half = 30 minutes\n4. Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes\n5. Total time in hours = 50 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5/6 hours\n6. Average time per kilometer = Total time / Total distance = (5/6 hours) / 10 km = 5/60 hours/km = 1/12 hours/km\n7. Converting to minutes per kilometer: (1/12 hours/km) * (60 minutes/hour) = 5 minutes/km\nI hope it is correct: 5 $minutes/km$\n",
