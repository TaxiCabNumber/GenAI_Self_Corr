At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA Statistics student wants to find out the average daily allowance of the middle school students. According to his survey, 2/3 of the students receive an average of $6 allowance per day while the rest gets an average of $4 a day. If he surveyed 60 students, what is the total amount of money those 60 students get in a day?",
        "inference": "1. Students receiving $6 allowance per day: (2/3) * 60 = 40 students\n2. Students receiving $4 allowance per day: 60 - 40 = 20 students\n3. Total daily allowance for students receiving $6: 40 students * $6/student = $240\n4. Total daily allowance for students receiving $4: 20 students * $4/student = $80\n5. Total daily allowance for all 60 students: $240 + $80 = $320\n\nI hope it is correct: $320\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 60 students x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 students who have a $6 daily allowance.\nWhile there are 60 students - 40 students = <<60-40=20>>20 students who have a $4 daily allowance.\nThe sum of the allowances of the 40 students who received $6 daily is 40 students x $6/day = $<<40*6=240>>240.\nThe sum of the allowances of the 20 students who received $4 daily is 20 students x $4/day = $<<20*4=80>>80.\nThe total daily amount of money of those 60 students is $240 + $80 = $<<240+80=320>>320.\n#### 320"
