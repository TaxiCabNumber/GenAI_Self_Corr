At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBobby needs to buy a new pair of fancy shoes.  He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade.  The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.  He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.  The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes.  How much did Bobby pay?",
        "inference": "1. Cost of mold: $250\n2. Total labor cost for 8 hours at $75/hour: 8 hours * $75/hour = $600\n3. Discounted labor cost (80% of $600): $600 * 0.80 = $480\n4. Total cost: $250 (mold) + $480 (labor) = $730\n\nI hope it is correct: $730\n",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of labor is 75*8=$<<75*8=600>>600\nSo Bobby pays 600*.8=$<<600*.8=480>>480\nSo that means Bobby pays 480+250=$<<480+250=730>>730\n#### 730"
