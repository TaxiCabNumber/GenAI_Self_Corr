At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarol is an aviation engineer deciding how much fuel to put in a jet. The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. Each person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, and each bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile. If there are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, and each person brought two bags, how many gallons of fuel does the plane need for a 400-mile trip?",
