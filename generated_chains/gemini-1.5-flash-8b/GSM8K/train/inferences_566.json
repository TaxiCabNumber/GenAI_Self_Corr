At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDale owns 4 sports cars. The red one can travel at twice the speed of the green one, but the green one can travel at 8 times the speed of the blue one.  The yellow one is broken and cannot move at all.  If the blue one can travel at a speed of 80 miles per hour, at what speed, in miles per hour, can the red car travel?",
