At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHarry is joining a marathon that's why he practices and varies his workouts from day to day. He ran 10 meters per hour on Monday. From Tuesday to Thursday he ran 50% faster than on Monday. Then on Friday, he ran 60% faster than he ran on Thursday. How fast did Harry run on Friday?",
        "inference": "1. Monday's speed: 10 meters per hour.\n2. Tuesday to Thursday's speed increase: 50% of 10 m/h = 0.5 * 10 = 5 m/h.\n3. Tuesday to Thursday's speed: 10 m/h + 5 m/h = 15 m/h.\n4. Thursday's speed: 15 m/h.\n5. Friday's speed increase: 60% of 15 m/h = 0.6 * 15 = 9 m/h.\n6. Friday's speed: 15 m/h + 9 m/h = 24 m/h.\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 $meters/hour$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Harry ran 10 x 50/100 = <<10*50/100=5>>5 meters per hour faster on Tuesday to Wednesday.\nSo he ran 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 meters per hour from Tuesday to Thursday.\nThen on Friday, he ran 15 x 60/100 = <<15*60/100=9>>9 meters per hour more.\nTherefore, he ran 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 meters per hour on Friday.\n#### 24"
