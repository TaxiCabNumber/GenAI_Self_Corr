At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJosh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?",

        "ground_truth": "There are four sides to a rectangle, the width is W and so the length is 2W, and we can put that in this equation: W + W + 2W + 2W = 30 feet.\nIf we add the sides together, we get 6W = 30 feet.\nTo find W, we divide both sides by 6, like this: 6W / 6 = 30 feet / 6, so W = 5 feet.\n#### 5"
