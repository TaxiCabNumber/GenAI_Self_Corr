At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA washing machine uses 20 gallons of water for a heavy wash, 10 gallons of water for a regular wash, and 2 gallons of water for a light wash per load of laundry. If bleach is used, there is an extra light wash cycle added to rinse the laundry thoroughly. There are two heavy washes, three regular washes, and one light wash to do. Two of the loads need to be bleached. How many gallons of water will be needed?",

Bleached light washes: 2 loads * 2 gallons/load = 4 gallons\n5. Total water used: 40 gallons + 30 gallons + 2 gallons + 4 gallons = 76 gallons\n\nI hope it is correct: 76 $gallons$\n",
