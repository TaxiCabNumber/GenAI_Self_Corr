At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKantana loves chocolate. Every Saturday she goes to the candy store and buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister. This last Saturday she picked up an additional 10 chocolates as a birthday gift for her friend Charlie. How many chocolates did Kantana end up buying for the month?",
        "inference": "Kantana buys 2 + 1 = 3 chocolates every Saturday.\nLet's assume there are 'x' Saturdays in a month.\nSo, Kantana bought 3x chocolates for herself and her sister.\nShe also bought 10 chocolates for Charlie.\nTotal chocolates bought = 3x + 10\nI hope it is correct: 3x+10 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There is 1 Saturday in a week and there are 4 weeks in a month so there are 1 * 4= <<1*4=4>>4 Saturdays in a month (on average)\nIf Kantana buys herself 2 chocolates every Saturday then this means she buys 2 * 4=<<2*4=8>>8 chocolates for herself for the month.\nKantana also buys her sister 1 chocolate on these trips so she is picking up an additional 1* 4=<<1*4=4>>4 additional chocolates for her sister for the month.\nKantana decided to also purchase some chocolates for her friend Charlie for his birthday. She bought Charlie 10 chocolates. This means that for the month she bought 10 chocolates for Charlie, 4 chocolates for her sister, and 8 chocolates for herself, 10+4+8= <<10+4+8=22>>22 chocolates bought in total for the month.\n#### 22"
