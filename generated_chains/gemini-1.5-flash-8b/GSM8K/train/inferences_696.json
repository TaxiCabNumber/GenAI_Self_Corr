At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEvery morning, Carla puts 79 apples in her backpack to eat for lunch. Unfortunately, Buffy stole some of Carla's apples on the school bus, and 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. So at lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining. How many apples did Buffy steal from Carla?",

        "ground_truth": "Let B be the number of apples that Buffy stole. Then 79 - B - 26 = 8.\nCombining constants produces 53 - B = 8.\nAdding B to both sides produces 52 = B + 8\nThus the number of apples stolen by Buffy is B = 53 - 8 = <<53-8=45>>45.\n#### 45"
