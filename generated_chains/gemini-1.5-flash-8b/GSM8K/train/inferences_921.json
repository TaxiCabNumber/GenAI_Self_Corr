At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere were 90 people at the summer picnic.  There were 50 soda cans, 50 plastic bottles of sparkling water, and 50 glass bottles of juice.  One-half of the guests drank soda, one-third of the guests drank sparkling water, and four-fifths of the juices were consumed.  How many recyclable cans and bottles were collected?",
        "inference": "1. Soda cans consumed: 90 guests * (1/2) = 45 cans\n2. Sparkling water bottles consumed: 90 guests * (1/3) = 30 bottles\n3. Juice bottles consumed: 50 bottles * (4/5) = 40 bottles\n4. Total recyclable items: 45 cans + 30 bottles + 40 bottles = 115 items\nI hope it is correct: 115 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The soda cans were consumed by 90 / 2 = <<90/2=45>>45 guests.\nThe sparkling water was consumed by 90 / 3 = <<90/3=30>>30 guests.\nThe juice bottles were consumed by 4/5 x 50 = <<4/5*50=40>>40 guests\nIn total there are 45 + 30 + 40 = <<45+30+40=115>>115 recyclable cans and bottles.\n#### 115"
