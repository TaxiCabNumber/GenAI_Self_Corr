He wants to save up for a new video game, which costs $60. Last weekend he earned $35. He can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. He caught five fish this Sunday. If 60% were trout, and the rest were blue-gill, how much more does he need to save before he can buy the game?",

Total money earned this weekend: $15 + $8 = $23\n6. Total money saved so far: $35 + $23 = $58\n7. Money needed to buy the game: $60 - $58 = $2\n\nI hope it is correct: $2\n",
