At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?",
        "inference": "1. Hare's speed: 10 feet/second\n2. Turtle's speed: 1 foot/second\n3. Race distance: 20 feet\n4. Let 'x' be the head start time for the turtle in seconds.\n5. Time taken by the hare to cover 20 feet = 20 feet / 10 feet/second = 2 seconds\n6. Time taken by the turtle to cover 20 feet = 20 feet / 1 foot/second = 20 seconds\n7. To finish in a tie, the turtle needs to cover the 20 feet in the same time as the hare, which is 2 seconds.\n8. The turtle has to start 'x' seconds ahead to cover the 20 feet in 2 seconds.\n9. Distance covered by the turtle in 'x' seconds = 1 foot/second * x seconds = x feet\n10. Distance remaining for the turtle to cover = 20 feet - x feet\n11. Time taken by the turtle to cover the remaining distance = (20 - x) feet / 1 foot/second = (20 - x) seconds\n12. Since the turtle needs to finish in 2 seconds, (20 - x) seconds = 2 seconds\n13. 20 - x = 2\n14. x = 20 - 2\n15. x = 18 seconds\n\nI hope it is correct: 18 $seconds$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet/second = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds\nWe can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot/second = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds\nFinally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds\n#### 18"
