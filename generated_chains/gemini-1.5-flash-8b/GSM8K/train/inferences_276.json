At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSabrina went to the library and found a historical series novel called The Rangers Apprentice. There are 14 books in the series, and each book has 200 pages. She read four books in a month and half the number of books remaining in the second month.

Total books remaining: 14 - 9 = 5\n6. Total pages in remaining books: 5 * 200 = 1000\nI hope it is correct: 1000 $pages$\n",
