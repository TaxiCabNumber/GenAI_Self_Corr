At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?",

Wait another 3 days before working out again, so total waiting time = 15 days + 3 days = 18 days.\n4. Wait 3 weeks after that to lift heavy again. 3 weeks = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.\n5. Total time until he can lift heavy again = 18 days + 21 days = 39 days.\n\nI hope it is correct: 39 $days$\n",
