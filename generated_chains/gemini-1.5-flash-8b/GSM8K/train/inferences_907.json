At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA store received 20 pallets of paper products to stock. Half the pallets were paper towels, a quarter were tissues, and a fifth were paper plates. The rest were paper cups. How many pallets of paper cups did the store receive?",
