A stone statue costs $20 and a wooden statue costs $5. He also pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes. How much is his total earning every month?",

        "ground_truth": "Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nHis total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = $<<20*5=100>>100.\nSo his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $200 + $100 = $<<200+100=300>>300.\nThe amount he pays for the tax is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.\nTherefore his total monthly earnings are $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=270>>270.\n#### 270"
