At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere is a rectangle that is 4 inches wide. If the rectangle's perimeter is 30 inches, what is the area of the rectangle?",

Dividing both sides by 2: 15 = length + 4\n4. Subtracting 4 from both sides: length = 11 inches\n5. Area of a rectangle = length * width\n6. Area = 11 inches * 4 inches = 44 square inches\n\nI hope it is correct: 44 $square\\ inches$\n",
