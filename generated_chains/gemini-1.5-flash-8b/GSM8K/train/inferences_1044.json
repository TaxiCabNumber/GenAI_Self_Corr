At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDuring a race transmitted on television, five advertisements were shown, lasting 3 minutes each. One minute of advertising costs $4000. What was the cost of transmitting these advertisements during the race?",
        "inference": "1. Total advertising time = 5 advertisements * 3 minutes/advertisement = 15 minutes\n2. Total cost per minute = $4000\n3. Total cost = 15 minutes * $4000/minute = $60000\n\nI hope it is correct: $60000\n",
