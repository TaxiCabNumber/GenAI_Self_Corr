        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIttymangnark and Kingnook are an Eskimo couple living in the most northern region of the Alaskan wilderness.  Together, they live with their child, Oomyapeck.  Every day Ittymangnark catches enough fish for the three of them to eat for the day and they split the fish equally between the three of them.  But after they have split the fish, they give Oomyapeck all of the eyes, who gives two of the eyes to his dog and eats the rest himself.  How many fish will each of them be given to eat if Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes in a day?",
        "inference": "Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes.\nOomyapeck gave 2 eyes to his dog.\nSo, Oomyapeck ate 22 - 2 = 20 eyes.\nOomyapeck got 20 eyes.\nIf Oomyapeck ate 20 eyes, then the total number of fish divided equally is 20 fish (1 fish = 1 eye).\nThe fish are divided equally between Ittymangnark, Kingnook, and Oomyapeck, so each person got 20 / 3 fish.\nSince each person gets $\\frac{20}{3} $ fish, we need to calculate this value.\n$\\frac{20}{3} = 6 \\frac{2}{3}$\nEach person will get 6 fish and $\\frac{2}{3}$ of a fish.\nIt is not possible to have $\\frac{2}{3}$ of a fish. \n20 fish divided among 3 people means there were 6 fish each. And one fish was left.\nSo Oomyapeck got 6 + 1/3 of a fish.\nEach person will get 6 fish.\nOomyapeck ate 20 eyes.\nThis means 20 fish.\nEach person gets 20 / 3 = 6 and 2/3 fish. \nSince we can't have parts of fish, we round down.\nSo each person gets 6 fish.\nI hope it is correct: 6 $fish$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the dog eats two eyes and Oomyapeck eats 22 eyes, then there are a total of 2+22=<<2+22=24>>24 eyes.\nWith 2 eyes per fish, 24 eyes represent 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 fish.\nIf they split that number of fish equally amongst the three of them, then each of them will be given 12/3=<<12/3=4>>4 fish to eat.\n#### 4"
