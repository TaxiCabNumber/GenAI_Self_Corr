At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAt Snowflake Plastics, each employee gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.  If Mark uses half his allotment of both types of days in a year, how many hours' worth of days does he have left if each day covers an 8-hour long workday?",

        "ground_truth": "First, we add the two types of days together to find 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 days in total between the two types.\nWe then divide this number in half to find Mark's remaining number of days, getting 20/2= <<10=10>>10 days remaining.\nSince each day counts as 8 hours, we multiply 10*8= <<10*8=80>>80 hours' worth of days remaining for Mark.\n#### 80"
