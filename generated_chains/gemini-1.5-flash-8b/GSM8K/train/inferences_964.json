At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKevin holds the world record for eating the biggest quantity of hot wings in 8 minutes. He can eat 64 wings without stopping. Alan, a boy who loves hot wings, wants to beat Kevin's record.  He is currently able to eat 5 hot wings per minute. How many more wings must he eat per minute to beat Kevin's record?",

This means his rate is 64 wings / 8 minutes = 8 wings per minute.\n\nAlan eats 5 wings per minute.\n\nTo beat Kevin's record, Alan needs to eat more than 8 wings per minute.\n\nAlan needs to eat 8 wings per minute - 5 wings per minute = 3 more wings per minute.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $wings/minute$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Knowing Kevin's record of eating 70 wings in 8 minutes or 64 / 8 = 8 wings in a minute\nAlan must increase his ability to eat 5 wings per minute to 8 - 5 = 3 wings per minute to equal Kevin's world record.\nTo beat Kevin, Alan must eat 3+1 = <<3+1=4>>4 hot wings per minute.\n#### 4"
