At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEugene built a model house out of toothpicks and a deck of playing cards.  For every card, he used 75 toothpicks.  The deck of playing cards had 52 cards, and Eugene used all but 16 of the cards to build his house.  If a box of toothpicks contains 450 toothpicks, how many boxes of toothpicks did Eugene use to create his model house?",
