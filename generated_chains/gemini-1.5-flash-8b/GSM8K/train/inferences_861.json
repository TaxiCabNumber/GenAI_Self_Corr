At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA dental office gives away 2 toothbrushes to every patient who visits.  His 8 hour days are packed and each visit takes .5 hours.  How many toothbrushes does he give in a 5 day work week?",
