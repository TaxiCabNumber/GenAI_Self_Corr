At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?",
