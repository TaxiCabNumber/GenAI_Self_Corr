At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake splits 8 shots of vodka with his friend.  Each shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces.  If the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, how much pure alcohol did Jake drink?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total volume of vodka: 8 shots * 1.5 ounces/shot = 12 ounces\n\n2. Calculate the volume of pure alcohol: 12 ounces * 0.50 = 6 ounces\n\nI hope it is correct: 6 $ounces$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Jake drank 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 shots\nSo he drank 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 ounces of vodka\nThat means he drank 6*.5=<<6*.5=3>>3 ounces of pure alcohol\n#### 3"
