At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMiriam spent 30 minutes doing laundry, 15 minutes cleaning the bathroom, a certain amount of time cleaning her room, and 40 minutes doing homework. If she spent a total of two hours on these tasks, how long, in minutes, did she spend cleaning her room?",

Calculate the total time spent on laundry, bathroom cleaning, and homework: 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 40 minutes = 85 minutes\n\n3. Calculate the time spent cleaning her room: 120 minutes (total time) - 85 minutes (other tasks) = 35 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 35 $minutes$\n",
