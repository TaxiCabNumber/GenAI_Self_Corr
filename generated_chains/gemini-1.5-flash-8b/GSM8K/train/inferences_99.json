        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?",
        "inference": "1. **Size of the second tank:** The first tank is twice the size of the second, and the first tank has 48 gallons.  So the second tank is 48 gallons / 2 = 24 gallons.\n\n2. **Fish in the second tank:**  With 24 gallons and 2-inch fish, the second tank can hold 24 gallons / 2 inches/fish = 12 fish.\n\n3. **Fish in the first tank:** The first tank has 48 gallons, and 3-inch fish. So the first tank can hold 48 gallons / 3 inches/fish = 16 fish.\n\n4. **Difference in fish:** Initially, there are 16 fish in the first tank and 12 fish in the second tank. The difference is 16 fish - 12 fish = 4 fish.\n\n5. **One fish eats another:** If one fish from the first tank eats another, the number of fish in the first tank decreases by 1. This changes the difference to 3 fish.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $fish$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The second tank is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 gallons.\nFollowing her rule, Gail keeps 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 two-inch fish in the second tank.\nShe keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 fish in the first tank.\nIf one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 16 - 1 = <<16-1=15>>15 fish in the first tank.\nThus, Gail would have 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 more fish in the first tank.\n#### 3"
