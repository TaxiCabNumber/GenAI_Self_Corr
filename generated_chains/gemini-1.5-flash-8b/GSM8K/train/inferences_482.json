At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIan is looking to lose some weight.  He decides to start jogging around his apartment complex every night to burn some calories.  He does 5 laps around the complex every night.  Each lap is 100 feet.  If it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, how many calories does Ian burn after 5 days of jogging like this?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total distance jogged per night: 5 laps * 100 feet/lap = 500 feet\n\n2. Calculate the total calories burned per night: 500 feet / 25 feet/calorie = 20 calories\n\n3. Calculate the total calories burned in 5 days: 20 calories/night * 5 nights = 100 calories\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 $calories$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5*100= <<5*100=500>>500 feet per day.\nSince there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 500*5= <<2500=2500>>2500 feet jogged.\nSince it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 2500/25=<<2500/25=100>>100 calories burned jogging throughout the week.\n#### 100"
