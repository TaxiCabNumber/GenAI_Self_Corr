        "inference": "The problem states that 223 dust particles were left after walking.  Then, sweeping and walking added 331 more.  The key is that the 331 particles are *added* to the existing 223 particles *after* sweeping.  This means the total after sweeping and walking is 223 + 331 = 554.  There is no reason to multiply this by 10 to get the total.  The problem statement is already telling you that 554 particles are remaining after sweeping.\n\nThe problem states that 554 represents 1/10 of the total dust. Therefore, the total dust particles are 554 * 10 = 5540\n\n#### $5540$\n",
