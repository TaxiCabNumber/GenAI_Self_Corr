At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDerek is watching the construction cranes downtown and is trying to figure out how much taller they have to be than the building they are building. He sees one crane that is 228 feet tall finishing a building that was 200 feet tall. He sees another that is 120 feet tall finishing a building that is 100 feet tall. The final crane he sees is 147 feet tall, finishing a building that is 140 feet tall. On average, what percentage taller are the cranes than the building?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the difference in height between each crane and the building it's finishing:\n   Crane 1: 228 - 200 = 28 feet\n   Crane 2: 120 - 100 = 20 feet\n   Crane 3: 147 - 140 = 7 feet\n\n2. Calculate the average difference:\n   Average difference = (28 + 20 + 7) / 3 = 55 / 3 = 18.33 feet\n\n3. Calculate the average height of the buildings:\n   Average building height = (200 + 100 + 140) / 3 = 440 / 3 = 146.67 feet\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of the average difference compared to the average building height:\n   Percentage = (18.33 / 146.67) * 100% = 0.125 * 100% = 12.5%\n\nI hope it is correct: 12.5%\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first crane is 14 percent taller because if 200 + 200x = 228 then x=.14\nThe second crane is 20 percent taller because if 100 + 100x = 120 then x = .2\nThe third crane is 5 percent taller because if 140 + 140x = 147 then x = .5\nThe total percent is 39 because 14 + 20 + 5 = <<14+20+5=39>>39\nThe average percent greater the height of the crane is than the building is 13 because 39 / 3 = <<39/3=13>>13\n#### 13"
