He trains 5 days a week for them and starts with wall push-ups.  He adds 1 rep a day and once he gets to 15 reps he will start training high elevation push-ups. and then low elevation push-ups, and finally floor push-ups.

        "inference": "The problem is that the progression assumes he immediately moves to the next level as soon as he completes a goal for the current level. The progression is not properly defined.\n\nLet's assume the progression is as follows:\n1. Wall Push-ups: 1 rep/day, 5 days/week.\n2. High Elevation Push-ups: 2 reps/day, 5 days/week.\n3. Low Elevation Push-ups: 3 reps/day, 5 days/week.\n4. Floor Push-ups: 4 reps/day, 5 days/week.\n\n* **Wall Push-ups:** He needs to get to 15 reps.  At 1 rep/day for 5 days/week, this will take 15 reps / (1 rep/day * 5 days/week) = 3 weeks.\n* **High Elevation Push-ups:**  To reach 15 reps, he needs to do 15 reps / (2 reps/day * 5 days/week) = 1.5 weeks per level which is not valid since he cannot do half of a week. We need to round it up. Therefore 2 reps/day for 5 days/week will require 8 weeks to reach 15 reps (15 / (2 * 5) = 1.5 which is rounded up to 2 weeks. So, 2 weeks * 5 = 10 days for 10 reps. 3 weeks = 15 reps. 3 weeks per level)\n* **Low Elevation Push-ups:** He needs to do 15 reps at 3 reps/day, 5 days/week. This takes 15 reps / (3 reps/day * 5 days/week) = 1 week.\n* **Floor Push-ups:** He needs to do 15 reps at 4 reps/day, 5 days/week. This takes 15 reps / (4 reps/day * 5 days/week) = 0.75 weeks which rounds up to 1 week.\n\n\nThe total time to complete each level is 3 weeks for wall pushups, 2 weeks (rounding up from 1.5) for high elevation, 1 week for low elevation, and 1 week for floor pushups.  This is a total of 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 weeks.\n\n#### $7$\n",
