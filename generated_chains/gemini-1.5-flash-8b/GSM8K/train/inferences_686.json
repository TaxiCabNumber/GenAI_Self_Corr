At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJack and Jill shared the cost of renting a cottage that costs $5 an hour. If they rented it for eight hours, how much did each friend pay?",
        "inference": "Cost per hour = $5\nRental duration = 8 hours\nTotal cost = 5 * 8 = $40\nSince they shared the cost equally, each friend paid $40 / 2 = $20\n\nI hope it is correct: $20\n",
