At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?",
