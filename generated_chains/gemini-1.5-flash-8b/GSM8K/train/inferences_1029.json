At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFarmer Red has three milk cows: Bess, Brownie, and Daisy. Bess, the smallest cow, gives him two pails of milk every day. Brownie, the largest cow, produces three times that amount. Then Daisy makes one pail more than Bess. How many pails of milk does Farmer Red get from them each week?",

Total pails/day = 2 + 6 + 3 = 11 pails/day.\n5. Total pails/week = 11 pails/day * 7 days/week = 77 pails/week.\n\nI hope it is correct: 77 $pails$\n",
