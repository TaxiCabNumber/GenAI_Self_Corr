At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?",
        "inference": "1. Distance traveled eastward in 20 hours: 20 hours * 30 km/hour = 600 km\n2. Halfway point: 600 km\n3. One-third of the total distance: (1/3) * total distance\n4. Distance from the starting point to the one-third point: 600 km\n5.  Let 'x' be the total distance. Then (1/2)x = 600 km, so x = 1200 km.\n6. One-third of the total distance = (1/3) * 1200 km = 400 km\n7. Distance the ship was blown westward: 600 km - 400 km = 200 km\n\nI hope it is correct: 200 $km$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers.\n#### 200"
