At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAngie is part of a household with shared expenses and contributes $42 a month for necessities. She has a salary of $80 per month. She also pays a share of the household taxes each month. At the end of this month, she had $18 left over. How much did she pay in taxes this month?",
