He does marketing posts, advertisement posts, and customer outreach posts. His client has him spend four hours on customer outreach posts and half that time on advertisement posts each day. Bryan works eight hours a day. How much time in hours each day does he spend on marketing posts?",

Total time spent on customer outreach and advertisement posts: 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours\n4. Time spent on marketing posts: 8 hours - 6 hours = 2 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 $hours$\n",
