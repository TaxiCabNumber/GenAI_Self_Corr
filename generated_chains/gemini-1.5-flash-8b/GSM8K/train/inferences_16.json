At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?",
