A strange, incurable disease hit the farm and every day the farmer lost 20 chickens, 8 turkeys and 5 guinea fowls. After a week, how many birds will be left in the poultry?",

Guinea fowls lost in a week: 5 guinea fowls/day * 7 days = 35 guinea fowls\n4. Chickens remaining: 300 chickens - 140 chickens = 160 chickens\n5. Turkeys remaining: 200 turkeys - 56 turkeys = 144 turkeys\n6. Guinea fowls remaining: 80 guinea fowls - 35 guinea fowls = 45 guinea fowls\n7. Total birds remaining: 160 chickens + 144 turkeys + 45 guinea fowls = 349 birds\n\nI hope it is correct: 349 $birds$\n",
