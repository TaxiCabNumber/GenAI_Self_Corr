At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA new movie gets released and makes $120 million in the box office for its opening weekend.  It ends up making 3.5 times that much during its entire run.  If the production company gets to keep 60%, how much profit did they make if the movie cost $60 million to produce?",
        "inference": "1. Total box office earnings: $120 million * 3.5 = $420 million\n\n2. Production company's share: $420 million * 0.60 = $252 million\n\n3. Profit: $252 million - $60 million = $192 million\n\nI hope it is correct: $192,000,000\n",
        "ground_truth": "Over the movies run it made 120*3.5=<<120*3.5=420>>420 million\nSo the production company made 420,000,000*.6=$<<420000000*.6=252000000>>252,000,000\nSo they got a profit of 252,000,000-60,000,000=$<<252000000-60000000=192000000>>192,000,000\n#### 192000000"
