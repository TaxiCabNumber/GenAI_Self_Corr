At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA clothing store sells 20 shirts and 10 pairs of jeans. A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?",
        "inference": "1. Jeans cost twice as much as shirts, so jeans cost $10 * 2 = $20 each.\n\n2. Total earnings from shirts: 20 shirts * $10/shirt = $200\n\n3. Total earnings from jeans: 10 jeans * $20/jeans = $200\n\n4. Total earnings: $200 + $200 = $400\n\nI hope it is correct: $400\n",
        "ground_truth": "Twenty shirts amount to $10 x 20 = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nThe cost of each pair of jeans is $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo 10 pairs of jeans amount to $20 x 10 = $<<20*10=200>>200.\nTherefore, the store will earn $200 + $200 = $<<200+200=400>>400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.\n#### 400"
