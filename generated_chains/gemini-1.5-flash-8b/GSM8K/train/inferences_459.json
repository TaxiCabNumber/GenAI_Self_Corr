At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA year ago, the total cost of buying a lawnmower was 2/5 times less than the cost it goes for now. If the cost was $1800 a year ago, calculate how much it would cost Mr. Lucian to buy 4 such lawnmowers.",

If the cost a year ago was $1800, then the current cost is (3/5) * $1800 = $1080.\n\n3.  The cost of 4 lawnmowers is 4 * $1080 = $4320.\n\nI hope it is correct: $4320\n",
