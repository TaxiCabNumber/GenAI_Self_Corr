At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Lu owns a computer store. For last month, half of their sales are laptops, one-third are netbooks, and the rest are desktop computers. If Mr. Lu's store was able to sell a total of 72 computers, how many of them are desktop computers?",
        "inference": "1. Laptops: 72 * (1/2) = 36\n2. Netbooks: 72 * (1/3) = 24\n3. Total of laptops and netbooks: 36 + 24 = 60\n4. Desktop computers: 72 - 60 = 12\n\nI hope it is correct: 12 $computers$\n",
