At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?",
