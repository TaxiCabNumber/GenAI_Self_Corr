At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn pays for half the cost of raising a child.  It cost $10,000 a year for the first 8 years and then twice that much per year until the child is 18.  University tuition then costs $250,000.  How much did it cost?",

Total cost before university: $80,000 + $200,000 = $280,000\n4. John's share of cost before university: $280,000 / 2 = $140,000\n5. University tuition cost: $250,000\n6. John's share of university tuition: $250,000 / 2 = $125,000\n7. Total cost for John: $140,000 + $125,000 = $265,000\nI hope it is correct: 265000 $answer$\n",
