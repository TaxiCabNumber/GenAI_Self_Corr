At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?",

Set up a proportion: (1/4 inch) / (8 miles) = (27/8 inches) / (x miles)\n\n3. Cross-multiply: (1/4) * x = (27/8) * 8\n\n4. Simplify: x = (27/8) * 4/1\n\n5. Simplify further: x = 27/2\n\n6. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number or decimal: 27/2 = 13.5 miles\n\nI hope it is correct: 54 $miles$\n",
