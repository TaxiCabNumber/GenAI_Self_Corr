At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarla needs to drive her car to do a bunch of errands. She needs to drive 8 miles to the grocery store, 6 miles to pick up her kids from school, 12 miles to drop her kids off at soccer practice, and twice the distance from the school to soccer practice to get everyone home again. If Carla's car gets 25 miles per gallon, and gas costs $2.50, how much will Carla have to spend on gas for her trip?",

Distance back from soccer practice: 2 * 12 miles = 24 miles\n5. Total distance driven: 8 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 50 miles\n6. Gallons of gas needed: 50 miles / 25 miles/gallon = 2 gallons\n7.
