She buys each grandkid 2 cards a year and puts $80 in each card.  How much does she give away to grandchildren a year?",

Total cost for all grandchildren per year: $160/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = $480\n\nI hope it is correct: $480\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each grandchild gets 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 a year\nSo that means they get a total of 3*160=$<<3*160=480>>480\n#### 480"
