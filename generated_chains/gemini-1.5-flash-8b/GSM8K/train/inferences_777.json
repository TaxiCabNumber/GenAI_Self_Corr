At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMara and Riley went to a carnival, Mara rode the bumper car two times, Riley rode the space shuttle four times, and they both rode the Ferris wheel three times. If a ticket for a bumper car cost $2, a ticket for a space shuttle cost $4, and a ticket for a Ferris wheel cost $5, how much money did they spend?",

        "ground_truth": "Mara spent $2 x 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4 for riding the bumper car two times.\nRiley spent $4 x 4 = $<<4*4=16>>16 for riding the space shuttle 4 times.\nThey spent $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 each riding the Ferris wheel 3 times.\nSo, they spent a total of $15 x 2= $<<15*2=30>>30 riding the Ferris wheel.\nTherefore the total amount they spent at the carnival is $4 + $16 + $30 = $<<4+16+30=50>>50.\n#### 50"
