At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaddie wants to see how much her mom spends on coffee each week. She makes herself 2 cups of coffee per day. Each cup has 1.5 ounces of coffee beans. A bag of coffee costs $8 and contains 10.5 ounces of beans. She uses 1/2 a gallon of milk per week. A gallon of milk costs $4. She doesn't add any sugar to the coffee. How much does she spend on her coffee per week?",

Number of bags needed per week: 21 ounces / 10.5 ounces/bag = 2 bags\n4. Cost of coffee beans per week: 2 bags * $8/bag = $16\n5. Milk per week: 0.5 gallons\n6. Cost of milk per week: 0.5 gallons * $4/gallon = $2\n7. Total cost per week: $16 + $2 = $18\n\nI hope it is correct: $18\n",
