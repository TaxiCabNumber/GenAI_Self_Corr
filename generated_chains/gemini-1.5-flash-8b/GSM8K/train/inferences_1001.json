At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA plant supplier was able to sell 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each and 15 pieces potted Chinese money plant for $25. The money he earned was then used to pay his two workers $40 each and to buy new pots worth $150. How much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings?",

Worker payment: 2 workers * $40/worker = $80\n5. Total expenses: $80 + $150 = $230\n6. Money left: $1375 - $230 = $1145\n\nI hope it is correct: $1145\n",
