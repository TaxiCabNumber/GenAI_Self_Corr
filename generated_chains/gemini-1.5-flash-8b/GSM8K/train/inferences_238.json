He's already sold 4 brownies for $3 each and 5 lemon squares for $2 each. If Jack's goal is to make $50 and he sells cookies for $4 each, how many cookies does he need to sell to reach his goal?",

Total money from brownies and lemon squares: $12 + $10 = $22\n4. Money needed to reach goal: $50 - $22 = $28\n5. Cookies needed to reach goal: $28 / $4/cookie = 7 cookies\n\nI hope it is correct: 7 cookies\n",
