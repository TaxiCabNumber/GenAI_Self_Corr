At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nManex is a tour bus driver. He has to drive 55 miles to the destination and drive going back to the starting point on a different way that is 10 miles farther. If he can drive 1 mile for 2 minutes and stayed 2 hours at the destination, how long will it take the bus driver to do the entire tour in hours?",
        "inference": "1. Driving to the destination: 55 miles * 2 minutes/mile = 110 minutes\n\n2. Staying at destination: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes\n\n3. Driving back: 65 miles * 2 minutes/mile = 130 minutes\n\n4. Total time: 110 minutes + 120 minutes + 130 minutes = 360 minutes\n\n5. Convert to hours: 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 6 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The bus traveled 55 + 10 = <<55+10=65>>65 miles going back to the starting point.\nSo, the bus traveled a total of 55 + 65 = <<55+65=120>>120 miles.\nIt took 120 x 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 minutes to travel.\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then the bus traveled for 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours.\nTherefore, the entire tour took 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.\n#### 6"
