At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. If Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet, how many square feet is Benedict's house?",
        "inference": "1. Kennedy's house is 10000 square feet.\n2. Kennedy's house is 600 square feet larger than 4 times Benedict's house. This can be written as an equation: 10000 = 4 * (Benedict's house) + 600\n3. Subtract 600 from both sides of the equation: 10000 - 600 = 4 * (Benedict's house)\n4. Simplify: 9400 = 4 * (Benedict's house)\n5. Divide both sides by 4: 9400 / 4 = Benedict's house\n6. Calculate: 2350 = Benedict's house\n\nI hope it is correct: 2350 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of square feet in Benedict's house be x. So, we can write the equation 4 * x + 600 = 10000.\nSubtracting 600 from both sides we get 4 * x = 9400\nDividing both sides by 4 we get x = 2350 square feet.\n#### 2350"
