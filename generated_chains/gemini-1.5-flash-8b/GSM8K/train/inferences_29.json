At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?",
        "inference": "Let the previous monthly income be 'x'.\nRent and utilities used to be 40% of the income, so the amount spent on rent and utilities was 0.40x.\nNow, her salary is increased by $600, so her new monthly income is x + 600.\nRent and utilities now amount to 25% of her new income, so the amount spent on rent and utilities is 0.25(x + 600).\nThe amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same, so we can set up the equation:\n0.40x = 0.25(x + 600)\n0.40x = 0.25x + 150\n0.40x - 0.25x = 150\n0.15x = 150\nx = 150 / 0.15\nx = 1000\nI hope it is correct: 1000 $answer$\n",
