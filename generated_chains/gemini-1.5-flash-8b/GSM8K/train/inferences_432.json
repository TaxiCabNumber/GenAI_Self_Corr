At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTina is getting $20 for each book she sells. If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?",
        "inference": "1. Profit = Revenue - Cost\n2. Profit = ($20/book * books sold) - ($5/book * books sold)\n3. $120 = ($15/book * books sold)\n4. Books sold = $120 / $15/book = 8 books\n5. Customers = books sold / 2 books/customer = 8 books / 2 books/customer = 4 customers\n\nI hope it is correct: 4 $customers$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine the profit per book. To do this, we perform 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 dollars in profit per book.\nNext, we divide the total sales by the profit per book, performing 120/15=<<120/15=8>>8 books sold in total.\nSince the books are sold 2 at a time, we divide the number sold by 2 to find the total number of people sold to, performing 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 people in total.\n#### 4"
