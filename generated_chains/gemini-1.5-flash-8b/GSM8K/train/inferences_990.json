At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrace started her own landscaping business. She charges $6 an hour for mowing lawns, $11 for pulling weeds and $9 for putting down mulch. In September she mowed lawns for 63 hours, pulled weeds for 9 hours and put down mulch for 10 hours. How much money did she earn in September?",
