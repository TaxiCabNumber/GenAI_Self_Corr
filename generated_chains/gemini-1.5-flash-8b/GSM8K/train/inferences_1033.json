At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames takes up dancing for fitness.  He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking.  He dances twice a day for .5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week.  He burned 300 calories an hour walking.  How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?",
