At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNaomi is doing the wash. First she makes piles of different types, with one pile for towels, one for sheets, and one for clothes that need to be washed on the gentle cycle. The clothes take 30 minutes to wash. The towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash. The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels. How many minutes total will it take for Naomi to wash everything?",
        "inference": "1. Clothes: 30 minutes\n2. Towels: 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes\n3. Sheets: 60 minutes - 15 minutes = 45 minutes\n4. Total time: 30 minutes + 60 minutes + 45 minutes = 135 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 135 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The clothes take 30 minutes to wash and the towels take twice as long, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 minutes to wash the towels.\nThe sheets take 15 minutes less than the towels, 60 - 15 = <<60-15=45>>45 minutes to wash the sheets.\nIt takes 30 minutes + 60 minutes + 45 minutes = <<30+60+45=135>>135 minutes to wash everything.\n#### 135"
