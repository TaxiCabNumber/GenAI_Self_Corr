At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to get gym memberships so he can get in shape.  The gym close to his house is close but doesn't have everything he wants so he gets two different gym memberships.  The cheap one costs $10 a month and has a sign-up fee of $50.  The second gym is 3 times more expensive and it has a sign-up fee of 4 months membership.  How much total did he pay in the first year for gym membership?",

Total for cheap gym: $120 + $50 = $170.\n\n2. **Expensive gym:** The expensive gym is 3 times more expensive, so the monthly cost is $10/month * 3 = $30/month.  The sign-up fee is 4 months of membership, which is 4 months * $30/month = $120.\n\n3. **Total for expensive gym:** $120.\n\n4. **Total for both gyms:** $170 + $120 = $290.\n\nI hope it is correct: 290 $\n",
