At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total spent on the items with known prices: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143\n\n2. Subtract the total spent from the initial budget to find the remaining amount spent on shoes: $200 - $143 = $57\n\n3. Subtract the remaining amount from the budget to find how much was spent on the shoes: $57 - $16 = $41\n\nI hope it is correct: $41\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes.\nShe spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + <<+30+46+38+11+18=143>>143.\nShe used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184.\nThus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $<<184-143=41>>41 for the shoes.\n#### 41"
