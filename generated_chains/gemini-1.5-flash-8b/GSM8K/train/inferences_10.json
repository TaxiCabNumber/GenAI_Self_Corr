At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
