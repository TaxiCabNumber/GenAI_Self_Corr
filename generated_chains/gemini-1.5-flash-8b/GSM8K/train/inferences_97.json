        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "inference": "1. Books from top section: 12 + 8 + 4 = 24 books\n2. Mystery books from bottom section:  This is only half the books. Let 'x' be the total books from the bottom section. Then x/2 = mystery books. We don't know the exact number of mystery books.\n3. Books from bottom section (other than mystery): 5 + 6 = 11 books\n4. Total books from bottom section: Let 'y' be the total number of books. Then y = mystery books + 11 books.\n5. Combining sections: Total books = top section + bottom section.  24 + y = total books.  We need more information to find the exact value of 'y'.\n6. Insufficient Information: The problem is missing information about the total books in the bottom section. Without knowing the total books in the bottom section or the number of mystery books, the exact number of books on the cart when she started cannot be calculated.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: Cannot be determined\n",
        "ground_truth": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = <<12+8+4+11+5+6=46>>46 books total\n#### 46"
