At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA box is 8 inches in height, 10 inches in width, and 12 inches in length. A wooden building block is 3 inches in height, 2 inches in width, and 4 inches in length. How many building blocks can fit into the box?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the volume of the box: 8 inches * 10 inches * 12 inches = 960 cubic inches\n\n2. Calculate the volume of a single building block: 3 inches * 2 inches * 4 inches = 24 cubic inches\n\n3. Divide the volume of the box by the volume of a single block: 960 cubic inches / 24 cubic inches/block = 40 blocks\n\nI hope it is correct: 40 $blocks$\n",
