At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWanda weighs 30 pounds more than Yola currently. Wanda also weighs 80 pounds more than Yola did 2 years ago. How much did Yola weigh 2 years ago if she currently weighs 220 pounds?",
        "inference": "1. Yola currently weighs 220 pounds.\n\n2. Wanda currently weighs 220 + 30 = 250 pounds.\n\n3. Let Yola's weight 2 years ago be x.\n\n4. Wanda's weight 2 years ago was x + 80.\n\n5. Wanda's current weight is 250 pounds, and this is 80 pounds more than her weight 2 years ago. Therefore, Wanda's weight 2 years ago is 250 - 80 = 170 pounds.\n\n6. Since Wanda's weight 2 years ago was x + 80, we have x + 80 = 170.\n\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 170 - 80 = 90.\n\nI hope it is correct: 90 $pounds$\n",
