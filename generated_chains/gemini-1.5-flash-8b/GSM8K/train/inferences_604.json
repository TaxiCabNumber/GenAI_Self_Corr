If Santana always buys each of her brothers a birthday present and a Christmas present, how many more presents does she have to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year?",

Brothers with birthdays in the first half of the year: March (3) = 3\n3. Presents for the second half: 4 brothers * 2 presents/brother = 8 presents\n4. Presents for the first half: 3 brothers * 2 presents/brother = 6 presents\n5. Difference: 8 presents - 6 presents = 2 presents\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 $presents$\n",
