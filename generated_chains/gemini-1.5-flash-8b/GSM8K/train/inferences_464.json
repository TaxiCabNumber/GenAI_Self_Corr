At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?",
        "inference": "Let F be the number of games Frankie won and C be the number of games Carla won.\nWe are given that the total number of games played is 30.  So, F + C = 30.\nFrankie won half as many games as Carla.  This means F = C/2.\nSubstitute F = C/2 into the first equation:\nC/2 + C = 30\nCombine the terms with C:\n(C/2) + (2C/2) = 30\n3C/2 = 30\nMultiply both sides by 2/3:\n3C = 60\nC = 20\nTherefore, Carla won 20 games.\nI hope it is correct: 20 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of games that Frankie won.\nThen the number of games Carla won would be 2*x.\nAnd the sum of all the games would be x+2*x=30 games.\nThus, the expression simplifies to 3*x=30.\nAnd the value of x=<<10=10>>10 games.\nTherefore, the number of Carla's wins would be 2x=20 games.\n#### 20"
