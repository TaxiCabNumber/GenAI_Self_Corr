At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA movie theater has 6 screens which show movies back-to-back all day. If the movie theater is open for 8 hours, and each movie lasts 2 hours, how many movies are shown in total throughout the day?",
        "inference": "1. Total time in hours: 8 hours\n2. Time per movie: 2 hours\n3. Movies per screen per 8 hours: 8 hours / 2 hours/movie = 4 movies\n4. Total screens: 6 screens\n5. Total movies: 4 movies/screen * 6 screens = 24 movies\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 $movies$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each screen shows movies all day, which means each screen shows 8 hours/day / 2 hours per movie = <<8/2=4>>4 movies/day.\nSo in total, the movie theater shows 6 screens * 4 movies/day = <<6*4=24>>24 movies.\n#### 24"
