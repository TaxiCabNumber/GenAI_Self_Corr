He gave 4 to Todd, then he gave twice as many as he had given Todd to Alisha, and then he gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he had given to Alisha.  If Hector had 6 gumballs remaining, what is the total number of gumballs that Hector purchased?",

He gave 5 less than four times as many to Bobby as he gave to Alisha.  Four times as many is 4*8 = 32.  5 less than that is 32 - 5 = 27 gumballs to Bobby.\n5. The total number of gumballs Hector gave away is 4 + 8 + 27 = 39 gumballs.\n6.
