At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHarry is a professional dog-walker.  He is paid to go on long walks with dogs while their families are away from home.  On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs.  On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.  And on Thursday he walks 9 dogs.  He is paid $5 for each dog that he walks.  How many dollars does Harry earn in a week?",
