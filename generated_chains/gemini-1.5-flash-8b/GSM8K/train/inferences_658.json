At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSara is checking out two different stores to buy a computer. The first store offers a device for $950 with a 6% discount. The second sells the same computer for \u20ac920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?",

Calculate the discount amount for the second store: \u20ac920 * 0.05 = \u20ac46\n4. Calculate the final price for the second store: \u20ac920 - \u20ac46 = \u20ac874\n5. Convert the final price of the second store to dollars (assuming the exchange rate is 1\u20ac = $1.10): \u20ac874 * $1.10/\u20ac1 = $961.40\n6.
