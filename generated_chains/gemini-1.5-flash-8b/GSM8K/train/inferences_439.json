He sees some t-shirts that cost $8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for $2, and bags that cost $10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?",

Number of sets of 3 key chains that can be bought: $14 / $2 = 7 sets\n7. Total number of key chains: 7 sets * 3 key chains/set = 21 key chains\n\nI hope it is correct: 21 $key chains\n",
