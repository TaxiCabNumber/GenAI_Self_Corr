At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKrystian works in the library. He borrows an average of 40 books every day. Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average. How many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday?",
        "inference": "1. Daily average borrowed books: 40\n\n2. Friday's borrowed books: 40 + (40 * 0.40) = 40 + 16 = 56\n\n3. Total books borrowed in a week (Monday to Friday): (40 * 4) + 56 = 160 + 56 = 216\n\nI hope it is correct: 216 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 40/100 = <<40*40/100=16>>16 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 200 + 16 = <<200+16=216>>216 books.\n#### 216"
