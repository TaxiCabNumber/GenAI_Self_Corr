At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Callen bought 10 paintings at $40 each and 8 wooden toys at $20 each from the crafts store to resell at a profit. However, when he sold the items, the selling price of a painting was 10% less and the selling price of a hat 15% less. Calculate the total loss Mr. Callen made from the sale of the items.",

Selling price of 10 paintings: 10 * $36 = $360\n6. Selling price of a wooden toy: $20 * (1 - 0.15) = $17\n7. Selling price of 8 wooden toys: 8 * $17 = $136\n8.
