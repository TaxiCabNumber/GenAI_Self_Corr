At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNurse Missy is attending to the needs of 12 patients in her hospital ward.  Most of her patients require standard care, but one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements, which increases the serving time by 20%.  At dinner time, she brings each patient their meal. It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.  How long does it take, in minutes, for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients?",
        "inference": "1. Patients with special dietary requirements: 12 patients * (1/3) = 4 patients\n2. Patients with standard care: 12 patients - 4 patients = 8 patients\n3. Serving time for standard care patients: 8 patients * 5 minutes/patient = 40 minutes\n4. Serving time for special care patients: 4 patients * 5 minutes/patient * 1.20 = 24 minutes\n5. Total serving time: 40 minutes + 24 minutes = 64 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 64 $minutes$\n",
