At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the distance traveled after the 3rd turn.\n2. The total distance is the sum of the distances after each turn: 5 + 8 + x + ? = 23\n3. The problem states that the total distance is 23 meters.  Therefore 5 + 8 + x + ? = 23\n4.  5 + 8 + x + ? = 23 simplifies to 13 + x + ? = 23.\n5.  This means the distance from the 4th turn back to the starting point, denoted as '?', must equal 23 - 13 = 10 meters.\n6.  The problem gives us the total traveled distance around the ring which includes the distance traveled after the 4th turn, so x +10 =  23 - (5+8) = 10 meters\n7. The distance after the 3rd turn is 10 meters.\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $meters$\n",
        "ground_truth": "From the details given, the car has traveled 5 meters at the 1st turn + 8 meters after the 2nd turn + 0 meters after the 4th turn = <<5+8+0=13>>13 meters around the ring.\nIt must therefore have driven 23 total meters \u2013 13 calculated meters = 10 meters after the 3rd turn.\n#### 10"
