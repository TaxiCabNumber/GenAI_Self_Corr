At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAisha enjoys listening to music on her mp3 player. She starts with 500 songs on her mp3 player, then adds another 500 the week after that. She realizes her mp3 player has a large capacity for storing songs so she adds twice the amount she already had on her mp3 player. After a while, though, she decides that she doesn't like 50 of the songs and removes them. How many songs are on Aisha's mp3 player now?",
        "inference": "1. Initial songs: 500\n2. Songs added week after: 500\n3. Total songs after addition: 500 + 500 = 1000\n4. Doubles the amount: 1000 * 2 = 2000\n5. Songs removed: 2000 - 50 = 1950\n\nI hope it is correct: 1950 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Aisha starts with 500 songs + 500 songs = <<500+500=1000>>1000 songs added to her mp3 player in the first two weeks.\nAfter that Aisha adds twice that amount to her mp3 player, 1000 x 2 = <<1000*2=2000>>2000 songs added.\nShe now has 1000 + 2000 = <<1000+2000=3000>>3000 songs on her mp3 player.\nHowever, she decides she wants to remove 50 of them, 3000 - 50 = <<3000-50=2950>>2950 songs on her mp3 player.\n#### 2,950"
