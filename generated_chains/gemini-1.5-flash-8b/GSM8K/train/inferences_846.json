At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKurt's old refrigerator cost $0.85 a day in electricity.  He recently bought a new energy-efficient refrigerator that only cost $0.45 a day in electricity.  How much money does Kurt save in a 30-day month with his new refrigerator?",
        "inference": "Difference in daily cost = $0.85 - $0.45 = $0.40\nSavings per month = $0.40/day * 30 days = $12.00\nI hope it is correct: $12.00\n",
        "ground_truth": "The old refrigerator costs $0.85 a day so for 30 days it costs .85*30 = $<<0.85*30=25.50>>25.50\nThe new refrigerator costs $0.45 a day so for 30 days it costs .45*30 =$<<0.45*30=13.50>>13.50\nOver 30 days, Kurt saves 25.50-13.50 = $<<25.50-13.50=12.00>>12.00 a month with his new refrigerator\n#### 12"
