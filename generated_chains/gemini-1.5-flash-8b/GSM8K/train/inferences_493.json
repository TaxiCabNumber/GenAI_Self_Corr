At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHally and her friends organized a high school reunion. To cover the cost of a late-night party that they planned for at the reunion, each attendee had to pay $100. After the party, Hally and her friends realized that the total expenses were $500 less than the total contributions. If there were 50 people at the party, how much money was used to pay for the party expenses?",
        "inference": "1. Total contributions = 50 people * $100/person = $5000\n\n2. Total expenses = $5000 - $500 = $4500\n\nI hope it is correct: $4500\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total planned cost for the party was 100*50 = $<<100*50=5000>>5000\nThe total expenses for the party are 5000-500 = $<<5000-500=4500>>4500\n#### 4500"
