At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?",

Total tea needed for all guests: 6 ounces/person * 12 people = 72 ounces\n5. Since the ratio of tea to drink is 8:1, for 72 ounces of tea, the amount of drink needed will be: 72 ounces / 8 = 9 ounces\nI hope it is correct: 72 $answer$\n",
