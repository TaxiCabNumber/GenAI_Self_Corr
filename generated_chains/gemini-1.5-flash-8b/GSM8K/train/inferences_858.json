At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt is recommended that men should consume no more than 150 calories of added sugar per day. Mark took a soft drink in the afternoon that contained 2500 calories, 5% of which was from added sugar. Then he bought some bars of candy which had 25 calories of added sugar each. If he eventually exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, how many bars of candy did he take?",

Total added sugar intake from soft drink and candy: 125 + (x * 25) where x is the number of candy bars\n3. Recommended maximum added sugar intake: 150 calories\n4. Exceeded the recommended intake by 100%: 150 * 2 = 300 calories\n5. Equation to solve for x: 125 + 25x = 300\n6. Solving for x: 25x = 300 - 125\n7. Solving for x: 25x = 175\n8.
