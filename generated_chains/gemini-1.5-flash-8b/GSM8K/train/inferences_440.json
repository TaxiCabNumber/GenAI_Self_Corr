At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCori is 3 years old today.  In 5 years, she will be one-third the age of her aunt.  How old is her aunt today?",
        "inference": "1. Cori's age in 5 years will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.\n\n2. Let 'x' be the aunt's current age. In 5 years, the aunt will be x + 5 years old.\n\n3. We are given that Cori's age in 5 years (8) will be one-third the aunt's age in 5 years (x + 5).  So, we can write the equation: 8 = (1/3) * (x + 5)\n\n4. Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate the expression (x + 5): 24 = x + 5\n\n5. Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for x: 19 = x\n\nI hope it is correct: 19 $answer$\n",
