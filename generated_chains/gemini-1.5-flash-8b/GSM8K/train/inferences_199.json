At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGary bought his first used car for $6,000.  Gary borrowed the money from his dad who said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years.  Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years.  How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?",
