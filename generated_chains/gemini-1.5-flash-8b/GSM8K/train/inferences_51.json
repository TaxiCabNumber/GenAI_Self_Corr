She cuts a 4 foot by 6 foot rectangle for the living room, and a 2 foot by 4 foot rectangle for the bedroom. If the bolt of fabric is 16 feet by 12 feet, how much fabric is left in square feet?",

Area of bolt of fabric: 16 ft * 12 ft = 192 sq ft\n5. Fabric left: 192 sq ft - 32 sq ft = 160 sq ft\n\nI hope it is correct: 160 $sq ft$\n",
