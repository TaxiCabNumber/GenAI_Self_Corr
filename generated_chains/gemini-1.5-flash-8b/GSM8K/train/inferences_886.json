Then his mother called him and asked him to buy twice as many bottles as he already bought. Each bottle cost $2. Finally, he also bought half a pound of cheese and 1 pound of cheese costs $10.

Cost of 8 bottles: 8 * $2 = $16\n6. Remaining amount after buying more bottles: $92 - $16 = $76\n7. Half a pound of cheese: $10 / 2 = $5\n8.
