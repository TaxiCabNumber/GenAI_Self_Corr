At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHawkeye is driving to his aunt. He has to charge his battery for $3.5 per charge. If he charged his battery four times, and his battery charging budget was $20, how much money was he left with when he reached his aunt's place?",
