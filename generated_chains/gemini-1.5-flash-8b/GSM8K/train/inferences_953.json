At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWendi brought home 4 chickens.  After a few days, she brought home enough additional chickens to double the number of chickens she owned.  Then, a neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens.  Finally, Wendi found an additional 4 less than ten chickens and brought them home too.  After this, how many chickens does Wendi have?",

She found 4 less than 10 chickens: 10 - 4 = 6 chickens.\n5. She added the new chickens to her total: 7 + 6 = 13 chickens.\n\nI hope it is correct: 13 $chickens$\n",
