At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMason opens the hood of his car and discovers that squirrels have been using his engine compartment to store nuts. If 2 busy squirrels have been stockpiling 30 nuts/day and one sleepy squirrel has been stockpiling 20 nuts/day, all for 40 days, how many nuts are in Mason's car?",
