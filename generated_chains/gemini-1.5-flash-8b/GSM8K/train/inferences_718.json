        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake and Penny are hunting snakes. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?",
        "inference": "1. Let Jenny's snake length be 'x' inches.\n2. Jake's snake length is 'x + 12' inches.\n3. The combined length is x + (x + 12) = 70 inches.\n4. Simplifying the equation: 2x + 12 = 70\n5. Subtracting 12 from both sides: 2x = 58\n6. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 29\n7. Jenny's snake is 29 inches long.\n8. Jake's snake is x + 12 = 29 + 12 = 41 inches long.\n\nI hope it is correct: 41 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let j be the length of Jake's snake and p be length of Penny's snake. We know that j + p = 70, and j = p + 12.\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get p + 12 + p = 70\nCombining like terms, we get 2p + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2p = 58\nDividing both sides by 2, we get p = 58 / 2 = <<58/2=29>>29 inches. Penny's snake is 29 inches.\nSubstituting that length in to the equation j = p + 12, we get j = 29 inches + 12 inches = <<29+12=41>>41 inches\n#### 41"
