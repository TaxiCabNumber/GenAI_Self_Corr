At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are six unicorns in the Enchanted Forest. Everywhere a unicorn steps, four flowers spring into bloom. The six unicorns are going to walk all the way across the forest side-by-side, a journey of 9 kilometers. If each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step, how many flowers bloom because of this trip?",

Calculate the number of steps per unicorn: 9000 meters / 3 meters/step = 3000 steps\n\n3. Calculate the total number of steps taken by all unicorns: 3000 steps/unicorn * 6 unicorns = 18000 steps\n\n4. Calculate the total number of flowers bloomed: 18000 steps * 4 flowers/step = 72000 flowers\n\nI hope it is correct: 72000 $flowers$\n",
