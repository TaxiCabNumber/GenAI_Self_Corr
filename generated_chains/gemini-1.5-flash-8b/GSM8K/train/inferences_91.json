At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn works a job that offers performance bonuses.  He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours.  He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?",
        "inference": "1. **Normal work:** $80 / 8 hours = $10/hour\n\n2. **Bonus work:**  John works for 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n\n3. **Bonus earnings:** $80 + $20 = $100\n\n4. **Earnings per hour with bonus:** $100 / 10 hours = $10/hour\n\nI hope it is correct: $10\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=100>>100 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 100/10= <<100/10=10>>10 dollars an hour.\n#### 10"
