At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoan is at the grocery store. She has a total of $60 to spend. She is going to purchase 2 containers of hummus, which are $5 each. She is going to purchase chicken for $20, bacon for $10, and vegetables for $10. She wants to purchase apples which are $2 each. With her remaining money, how many apples can she purchase?",

Remaining money: $60 (total) - $10 (hummus) - $40 (other items) = $10\n4. Apples per dollar: $10 / $2/apple = 5 apples\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 apples\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total cost of the hummus is 2 * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10\nThe total cost of the chicken, bacon, and vegetables is $20 + $10 + $10 = $<<20+10+10=40>>40\nThe remaining money she has is $60 - $10 - $40 = $<<60-10-40=10>>10\nThe amount of apples she can purchase is $10 / $2 = <<10/2=5>>5\n#### 5"
