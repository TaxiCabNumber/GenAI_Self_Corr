At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoseph and his friends watched two movies in his house. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first. Before the movies, they spent 10 minutes making popcorn and twice as long making fries. How long, in hours, did it take Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies?",
        "inference": "1 hour and 30 minutes = 1.5 hours\nSecond movie length = 1.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 2 hours\nTime spent making fries = 10 minutes * 2 = 20 minutes = 0.333 hours (approximately)\nTotal movie time = 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 3.5 hours\nTotal time spent cooking = 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours\nTotal time = 3.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 4 hours\nI hope it is correct: 4 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first movie was 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long since an hour has 60 minutes.\nThe second movie was 90 + 30 = <<90+30=120>>120 minutes long.\nIt took them a total of 90 + 120 = <<90+120=210>>210 minutes to watch the two movies.\nIt took them 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes to cook the fries.\nThus, it took them a total of 10 + 20 = <<10+20=30>>30 minutes to cook.\nSo, they spent 210 + 30 = <<210+30=240>>240 minutes watching the movies and cooking.\nIn hours, this is equal to 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours.\n#### 4"
