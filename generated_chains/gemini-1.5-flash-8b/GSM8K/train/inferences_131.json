At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStudying for her test, Mitchell had read ten chapters of a book before 4 o'clock. When it clocked 4, Mitchell had read 20 pages of the 11th chapter of the book she was studying from. After 4 o'clock, she didn't read the remaining pages of chapter eleven but proceeded and read 2 more chapters of the book. If each chapter in the book had 40 pages, calculate the total number of pages that Mitchell had read altogether?",
