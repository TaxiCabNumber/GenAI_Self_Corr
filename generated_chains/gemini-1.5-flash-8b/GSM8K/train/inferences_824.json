At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA school has 15 classrooms. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks in each classroom and the rest have 25 desks in each classroom. Only one student can sit at one desk. How many students can this school accommodate so that everyone has their own desk?",
        "inference": "1. Classrooms with 30 desks: (1/3) * 15 = 5 classrooms\n2. Number of desks in classrooms with 30 desks: 5 classrooms * 30 desks/classroom = 150 desks\n3. Classrooms with 25 desks: 15 classrooms - 5 classrooms = 10 classrooms\n4. Number of desks in classrooms with 25 desks: 10 classrooms * 25 desks/classroom = 250 desks\n5. Total number of desks: 150 desks + 250 desks = 400 desks\n6. Total students the school can accommodate: 400 students\n\nI hope it is correct: 400 $students$\n",
