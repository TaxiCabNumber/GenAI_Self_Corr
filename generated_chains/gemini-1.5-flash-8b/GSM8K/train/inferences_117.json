At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into a display tank.  An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, but then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.  If the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, how many clownfish are now in the display tank?",
