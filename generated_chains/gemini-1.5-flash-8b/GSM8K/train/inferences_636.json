        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTina is working on her homework when she realizes she's having a hard time typing out her answers on her laptop because a lot of the keys are sticky. She is trying to get her homework done before dinner, though, so she needs to decide if she has time to clean her keyboard first. Tina knows her assignment will only take 10 minutes to complete. Dinner will be ready at 5:30 p.m. Tina decides to time how long it takes to remove and clean one key and will then multiply that time by how many keys she needs to fix. She counts 15 keys that are sticky and times it to take 3 minutes to clean one. After Tina has cleaned one key, there are 14 left to clean. How many minutes total will it take for Tina to both clean the remaining keys and finish her assignment?",
        "inference": "1. Cleaning one key takes 3 minutes.\n2. There are 15 keys that are sticky.\n3. Cleaning all 15 keys takes 15 keys * 3 minutes/key = 45 minutes.\n4. After cleaning one key, 14 keys remain.\n5. Cleaning the remaining 14 keys takes 14 keys * 3 minutes/key = 42 minutes.\n6. The assignment takes 10 minutes.\n7. Total time = 42 minutes + 10 minutes = 52 minutes.\nI hope it is correct: 52 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Tina has already cleaned one key so she has 14 left which take 3 minutes each to clean, 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42 minutes to clean all the keyboard keys.\nHer assignment will take 10 minutes to complete, so she needs 42 minutes + 10 minutes = 52 minutes total before dinner.\n#### 52"

        "inference": "The problem states that cleaning one key takes 3 minutes.  The crucial missing piece is that each key is cleaned *sequentially*.  You can't clean multiple keys simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the total time is simply 15 keys * 3 minutes/key = 45 minutes.\n\n#### 45 minutes\n",
