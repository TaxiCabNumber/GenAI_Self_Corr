At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKris is blowing u balloons for her sister\u2019s party. She has 30 minutes to blow up as many balloons as possible and decides to enlist her brother\u2019s help to increase the number of balloons. Kris can blow up a total of 2 balloon per minute, and her brother works twice as fast. After 15 minutes, her brother doubles his speed and works at this new speed for the remaining 15 minutes. After the 30 minutes, how many balloons, in total, did Kris and her brother blow up?",

        "ground_truth": "Throughout the 30 minutes, Kris blows up 2 balloons per minute * 30 minutes = <<2*30=60>>60 balloons.\nHer brother works at double Kris' speed in the first 15 minutes so he works at 2 balloons per minute * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 balloons per minute.\nSo in the first 15 minutes, he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<4*15=60>>60 balloons.\nIn the second 15 minutes, he is working at double the rate he did previously, so he blows up 4 balloons per minute * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 balloons per minute.\nIn the second 15 minutes, Kris\u2019 brother therefore blows up 8 balloons per minute * 15 minutes = <<8*15=120>>120 balloons.\nThroughout the 30 minutes, he has blown up a total of 60 + 120 = <<60+120=180>>180 balloons.\nKris and her brother therefore blew up a total of 60 balloons from Kris + 180 balloons from Kris\u2019 brother = <<60+180=240>>240 balloons.\n#### 240"
