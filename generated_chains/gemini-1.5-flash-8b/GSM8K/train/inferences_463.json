At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt takes 30 minutes to make pizza dough and another 30 minutes in the oven for the pizza to cook. If one batch of pizza dough can make 3 pizzas but the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, how many hours would it take for Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas?",

Oven time for 12 pizzas: 12 pizzas / 2 pizzas/batch * 30 minutes/pizza = 180 minutes\n\n3. Total time: 120 minutes + 180 minutes = 300 minutes\n\n4.
