At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcos has to get across a 5 mile lake in his speedboat in 10 minutes so he can make it to work on time. How fast does he need to go in miles per hour to make it?",

We know the distance (5 miles) and the time (1/6 hours).\n\n3. Solve for speed: speed = distance / time = 5 miles / (1/6 hours) = 5 \u00d7 6 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour.\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 $miles/hour$\n",
