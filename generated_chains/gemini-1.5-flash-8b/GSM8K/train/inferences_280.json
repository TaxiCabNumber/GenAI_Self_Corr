At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe card shop has two boxes of cards. The first box contains cards that cost $1.25 each. The second box contains cards that cost $1.75 each. A boy then comes in and buys 6 cards from each box. What was the total cost, in dollars, of the cards he bought?",

        "ground_truth": "The cost of one card from each box in total is 1.25+1.75=<<1.25+1.75=3>>3 dollars.\nThe total cost of cards the boy bought is 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 dollars.\n#### 18"
