At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?",
        "inference": "1. Vampire-themed bags needed: 11\n   Pumpkin-themed bags needed: 14\n2. Vampire-themed packs needed: 11 / 5 = 2 with a remainder of 1.  So, 3 packs are needed.\n   Pumpkin-themed packs needed: 14 / 5 = 2 with a remainder of 4. So, 3 packs are needed.\n3. Cost of vampire packs: 3 packs * $3/pack = $9\n   Cost of pumpkin packs: 3 packs * $3/pack = $9\n4. Cost of additional vampire bags: 1 bag * $1/bag = $1\n   Cost of additional pumpkin bags: 4 bags * $1/bag = $4\n5. Total cost: $9 + $9 + $1 + $4 = $23\n\nI hope it is correct: $23\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7.\nSimilarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10.\nTherefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17.\n#### 17"
