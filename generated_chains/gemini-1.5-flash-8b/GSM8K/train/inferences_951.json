At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMichonne is inviting her friends to her birthday party. She invites 6 of her friends from school and 12 of her friends from her neighborhood. Each of her friends asks if they can bring two friends along as well.
