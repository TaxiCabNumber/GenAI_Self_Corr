At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJill and her brother Jack are going apple picking.  Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full.  Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples, but currently space for 4 more.  How many times could Jack's current number of apples fit into Jill's basket?",
        "inference": "Jack's basket holds 12 apples, but currently has space for 4 more, meaning it currently holds 12 apples.  Jill's basket holds twice as much, so it holds 2 * 12 = 24 apples.  Jack's current number of apples (12) can fit into Jill's basket 12/24 = 1/2 times.\n\nI hope it is correct: 0.5 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's, and Jack's is capable of holding 12 apples in total, this means Jill's basket can hold 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 apples in total.\nSince Jack has 4 less than the maximum amount of apples he can fit in his basket, this means Jack has 12-4= <<12-4=8>>8 apples in his basket.\nTherefore, Jill's basket can hold 24/8= <<24/8=3>>3 times the amount of apples Jack is currently carrying.\n#### 3"
