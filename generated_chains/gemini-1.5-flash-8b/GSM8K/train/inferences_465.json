At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?",
        "inference": "1. First route time with all green lights: 10 minutes.\n2. Time added per red light: 3 minutes.\n3. Number of stoplights: 3.\n4. Total time added if all lights are red: 3 red lights * 3 minutes/red light = 9 minutes.\n5. Total time for first route with all red lights: 10 minutes (green lights) + 9 minutes (red lights) = 19 minutes.\n6. Second route time: 14 minutes.\n7. Difference in time: 19 minutes (first route with all red lights) - 14 minutes (second route) = 5 minutes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.\nThus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.\n#### 5"
