At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTommy is making 12 loaves of bread. He needs 4 pounds of flour per loaf. A 10-pound bag of flour costs $10 and a 12-pound bag costs $13. When he is done making his bread, he has no use for flour and so he will throw away whatever is left. How much does he spend on flour if he buys the cheapest flour to get enough?",

Determine if a single 10-pound bag is enough: 10 pounds < 48 pounds, so one bag is not enough.\n\n3. Determine if two 10-pound bags are enough: 10 pounds/bag * 2 bags = 20 pounds.  This is not enough.\n\n4. Determine if a single 12-pound bag is enough: 12 pounds >= 48 pounds, so one 12-pound bag is enough.\n\n5.
