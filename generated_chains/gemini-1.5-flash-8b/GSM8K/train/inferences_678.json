If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?",

Calculate the time it takes the border collie to cover the distance: Time = Distance / Speed = 160 ft / 5 ft/s = 32 seconds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 32 $seconds$\n",
