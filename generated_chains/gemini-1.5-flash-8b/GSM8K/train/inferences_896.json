At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe math questions in a contest are divided into three rounds: easy, average, and hard. There are corresponding points given for each round. That is 2, 3, and 5 points for every correct answer in the easy, average, and hard rounds, respectively.
