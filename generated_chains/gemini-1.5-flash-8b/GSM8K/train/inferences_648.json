The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets?",

Songs per set in the third and fourth sets: 18 / 2 = 9 songs\n6. Encore songs were subtracted in step 2.\nI hope it is correct: 9 $songs$\n",
