At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTonya is buying Christmas gifts for her sisters. She has 2 sisters and wants to spend the exact same amount on each. She buys her younger sister 4 dolls that cost $15 each. She plans to buy lego sets for her older sister. They cost $20 each. How many lego sets does she buy?",
        "inference": "1. Younger sister's gifts cost: 4 dolls * $15/doll = $60\n2. Total budget: $60 (younger sister) / 2 sisters = $30/sister\n3. Lego sets cost: $30/set = $20/set\n4. Number of Lego sets: $30/$20/set = 1.5 sets\n\nI hope it is correct: 1 $sets$\n",
        "ground_truth": "She spent $60 on her younger sister because 4 x 15 = <<4*15=60>>60\nShe buys 3 lego sets for her older sister because 60 / 20 = <<60/20=3>>3\n#### 3"
