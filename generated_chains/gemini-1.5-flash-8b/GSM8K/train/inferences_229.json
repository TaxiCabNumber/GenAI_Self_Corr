At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJan buys 1000 feet of cable.  She splits it up into 25-foot sections.  She gives 1/4 of that to a friend.  She then puts half of the rest in storage. How much does she keep on hand?",
