        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA roadwork company is paving a newly constructed 16-mile road. They use a mixture of pitch and gravel to make the asphalt to pave the road. Each truckloads of asphalt uses two bags of gravel and five times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch to make. It takes three truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. The company paved 4 miles of road on one day, then one mile less than double that on the second day. How many barrels of pitch will the company need to finish the remaining road on the third day?",
        "inference": "1. Asphalt per mile: 3 truckloads/mile\n2. Gravel per truckload: 2 bags\n3. Pitch per truckload: 2 bags / 5 = 0.4 barrels\n4. Asphalt used on day 1: 4 miles * 3 truckloads/mile = 12 truckloads\n5. Gravel used on day 1: 12 truckloads * 2 bags/truckload = 24 bags\n6. Pitch used on day 1: 12 truckloads * 0.4 barrels/truckload = 4.8 barrels\n7. Asphalt used on day 2: (4 miles * 2 - 1) miles * 3 truckloads/mile = 21 truckloads\n8. Gravel used on day 2: 21 truckloads * 2 bags/truckload = 42 bags\n9. Pitch used on day 2: 21 truckloads * 0.4 barrels/truckload = 8.4 barrels\n10. Total asphalt used in two days: 12 truckloads + 21 truckloads = 33 truckloads\n11. Remaining road: 16 miles - 4 miles - (4*2-1) miles = 16 - 4 - 7 = 5 miles\n12. Asphalt needed for the remaining road: 5 miles * 3 truckloads/mile = 15 truckloads\n13. Gravel needed for the remaining road: 15 truckloads * 2 bags/truckload = 30 bags\n14. Pitch needed for the remaining road: 15 truckloads * 0.4 barrels/truckload = 6 barrels\nI hope it is correct: 6 $barrels$\n",
        "ground_truth": "On the second day, the company paved 4 * 2 - 1 = <<4*2-1=7>>7 miles.\nThe company has 16 - 7 - 4 = <<16-7-4=5>>5 miles of road remaining to pave.\nThey will need 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 truckloads of asphalt to pave 5 miles of road.\nFor 15 truckloads, they will need 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 bags of gravel.\nThus, the company will need 30 / 5 = <<30/5=6>>6 barrels of pitch to finish the road on the third day.\n#### 6"
