If my total bill was $140, the sales tax in my city is 10%, I ordered a NY Striploin for $80, and I ordered a glass of wine for $10, how much did they charge me for gratuities?",

Calculate the total cost of the meal before gratuity: $88 + $11 = $99\n\n4. Calculate the gratuity: $140 - $99 = $41\n\nI hope it is correct: $41\n",
