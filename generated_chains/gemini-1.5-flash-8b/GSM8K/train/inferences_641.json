        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlex makes luxury dresses out of silk. Each dress needs 5 meters of silk and Alex has 600 meters of silk in storage. His friends also want to learn how to make these dresses so Alex gives all 5 of them 20 meters of silk each. He uses the rest to make dresses himself. How many dresses can Alex make?",
        "inference": "1. Silk needed per dress: 5 meters\n2. Total silk Alex has: 600 meters\n3. Silk given to friends: 5 friends * 20 meters/friend = 100 meters\n4. Remaining silk for Alex: 600 meters - 100 meters = 500 meters\n5. Number of dresses Alex can make: 500 meters / 5 meters/dress = 100 dresses\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 dresses\n",
        "ground_truth": "Alex gives his friends a total of 5 friends * 20 meters of silk = <<5*20=100>>100 meters of silk.\nThis means he has 600 \u2013 100 = <<600-100=500>>500 meters of silk left in storage.\nHe can therefore make 500 meters of silk / 5 meters of silk per dress = <<500/5=100>>100 dresses.\n#### 100"
