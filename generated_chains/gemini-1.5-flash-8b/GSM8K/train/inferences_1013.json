He bought four long-sleeved ones that cost $15 each, and some striped ones that cost $10 each. How many striped jerseys did Justin buy if he spent a total of $80?",

        "ground_truth": "Four long-sleeved jerseys cost $15 x 4 = $<<15*4=60>>60.\nSo the striped jerseys amount to $80 - $60 = $<<80-60=20>>20.\nHence, Justin bought $20/$10= <<20/10=2>>2 striped jerseys.\n#### 2"
