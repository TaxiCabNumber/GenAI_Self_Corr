At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA club opens up and charges $20 to enter.  James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends.  He also buys 6 drinks for himself. Drinks cost $6 each.  He decides to eat some food so he orders some fried chicken which costs $14.  He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders.  How much did he spend for the night?",

        "ground_truth": "He buys 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 drinks for his friends\nSo he orders 10+6=<<10+6=16>>16 total drinks.\nThe cost of the drinks was 16*6=$<<16*6=96>>96\nSo his order came out to 96+14=$<<96+14=110>>110\nThe tip came out to 110*.3=$<<110*.3=33>>33\nSo his order cost 110+33=$<<110+33=143>>143\nAdding in the cover charge means it cost 143+20=$<<143+20=163>>163\n#### 163"
