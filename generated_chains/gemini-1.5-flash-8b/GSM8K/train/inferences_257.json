At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHannah sold 40 pieces of cookies for $0.8 each and 30 cupcakes for $2 each. She used the money to buy 2 sets of measuring spoons for $6.5 each. How much money does she have left?",
