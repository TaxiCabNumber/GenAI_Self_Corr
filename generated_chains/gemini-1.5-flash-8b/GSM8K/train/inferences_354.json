At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSeth bought some boxes of oranges. He gave a box to his mother. He then gave away half of the remaining boxes. If Seth has 4 boxes of oranges left, how many boxes did he buy in the first place?",
