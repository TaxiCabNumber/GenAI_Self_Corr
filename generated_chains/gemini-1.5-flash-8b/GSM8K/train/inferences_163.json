At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames joins a football team and becomes the star.  He scores 4 touchdowns per game and each touchdown is worth 6 points.  There are 15 games in the season.  He also manages to score 2 point conversions 6 times during the season.
