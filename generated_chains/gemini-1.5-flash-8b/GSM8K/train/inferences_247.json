At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony has a terrible toothache and decides to buy some painkillers from the store.  He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home.  He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days.  On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better.  How many pills are left in the bottle?",
        "inference": "1. Days 1 and 2: 2 pills/day * 3 times/day * 2 days = 12 pills\n2. Days 3, 4, 5: (2 pills/day * 3 times/day) / 2 = 3 pills/day * 3 times/day * 3 days = 27 pills\n3. Day 6: 2 pills\n4. Total pills taken: 12 + 27 + 2 = 41 pills\n5. Pills left: 50 - 41 = 9 pills\n\nI hope it is correct: 9 $pills$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2*3=6 pills in total.\nTony repeats this process for two days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2*6= <<2*6=12>>12 pills\nTony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6/2= <<6/2=3>>3 pills a day.\nSince he repeats this process for three days, that means he takes 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 pills for that period.\nAdding in the two pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12+9+2=<<12+9+2=23>>23 pills.\nSince there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50-23=<<50-23=27>>27 pills remaining.\n#### 27"
