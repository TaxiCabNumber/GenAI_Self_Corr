At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTanya went to the grocery store to buy some fruit.  She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which were all placed in a single paper bag.  Unfortunately, the bag that the fruit had been placed in had developed a hole.  Therefore, as Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out of the bag.  When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 8 $plums$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If half of the fruit equals 9 pieces, then Tanya bought 2*9=<<2*9=18>>18 pieces of fruit.\nThus, Tanya bought 18-6-4-2=<<18-6-4-2=6>>6 plums.\n#### 6"
