At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhile cultivating a small farm, a farmer spent $50 on corn seeds, $35 on fertilizers and pesticides, and $15 on labor. After a successful harvest, he was able to gather 10 bags of corn. How much should he sell each bag, if he wants to make a profit of 10%?",

Calculate the total amount needed to cover costs and profit: $100 + $10 = $110\n\n4. Calculate the selling price per bag: $110 / 10 bags = $11\n\nI hope it is correct: $11\n",
