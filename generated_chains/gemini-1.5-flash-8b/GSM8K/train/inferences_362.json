At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaren\u2019s work tote bag is twice the weight of her husband Kevin\u2019s briefcase when the briefcase is empty. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen\u2019s tote. Kevin\u2019s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. If Karen\u2019s tote weighs 8 pounds, how many more pounds does Kevin\u2019s laptop weigh than Karen\u2019s tote?",
        "inference": "1. Karen's tote weighs 8 pounds.  Kevin's empty briefcase weighs half that, or 4 pounds.\n\n2. When full, Kevin's briefcase weighs twice Karen's tote, which is 16 pounds.\n\n3. Kevin's work papers weigh 1/6 of the full briefcase's weight, so they weigh 16 pounds * (1/6) = 8/3 pounds.\n\n4. Kevin's laptop weighs the difference between the full briefcase weight and the work papers weight: 16 pounds - 8/3 pounds = 40/3 pounds.\n\n5. The difference between the laptop weight and Karen's tote weight is (40/3) pounds - 8 pounds = (40/3 - 24/3) pounds = 16/3 pounds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $16/3$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Kevin\u2019s full briefcase is 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 pounds.\nHis empty briefcase is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 pounds.\nThe contents of his briefcase weigh 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 pounds.\nHis work papers weigh 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 pounds.\nThus, his laptop weighs 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 pounds.\nTherefore, Kevin\u2019s laptop weighs 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 pounds more than Karen\u2019s tote.\n#### 2"
