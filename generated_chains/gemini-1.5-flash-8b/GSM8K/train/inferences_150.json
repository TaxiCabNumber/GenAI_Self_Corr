At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAngela is a bike messenger in New York. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the number of meals delivered.\nThe number of packages delivered is 8 times the number of meals, so it's 8x.\nThe total number of meals and packages is 27.\nTherefore, x + 8x = 27\n9x = 27\nx = 27 / 9\nx = 3\n\nI hope it is correct: 3 $meals$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let p be the number of packages Angela delivers and m be the number of meals. We know that p + m = 27 and p = 8m.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 8m + m = 27\nCombining like terms, we get 9m = 27\nDividing both sides by 9, we get m = 3\n#### 3"
