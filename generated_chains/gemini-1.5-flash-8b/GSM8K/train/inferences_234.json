He gives the cashier $7.00. If the cashier only has 1 quarter and 1 dime in his till, plus a bunch of nickels, how many nickels does Mark get in his change?",

Calculate the value of the quarter and dime in the cashier's till: $0.25 + $0.10 = $0.35\n\n4. Calculate the remaining change to be given in nickels: $0.75 - $0.35 = $0.40\n\n5.
