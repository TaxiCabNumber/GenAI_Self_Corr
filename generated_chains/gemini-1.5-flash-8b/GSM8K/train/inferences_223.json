At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAndy and Bob went to the canteen to buy snacks. They spent the same amount. Andy bought a can of soda at $1 and two hamburgers at $2 each.  Bob ordered two sandwiches for $3 and a can of fruit drink.  How much did Bob's fruit drink cost?",
        "inference": "Andy spent $1 + (2 * $2) = $5.\nBob spent the same amount, so Bob spent $5.\nBob spent $3 + (cost of fruit drink) = $5\nCost of fruit drink = $5 - $3 = $2\nI hope it is correct: $2$\n",
