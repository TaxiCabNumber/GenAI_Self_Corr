At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident.
