At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrian is a real estate agent. He makes a 2% commission on each sale. During June, he sold three houses. The houses sold for $157,000, $499,000, and $125,000. What was Brian\u2019s total commission on these three sales?",

Calculate the commission for the third house: $125,000 * 0.02 = $2,500\n4. Add the commissions together: $3,140 + $9,980 + $2,500 = $15,620\n\nI hope it is correct: $15,620\n",
