The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?",

Caffeine in the second drink (2 ounces): 62.5 grams/ounce * 2 ounces = 125 grams\n\n4. Total caffeine from drinks: 250 grams + 125 grams = 375 grams\n\n5. Caffeine from pill: 375 grams\n\n6.

        "ground_truth": "The second drink was 2/12=1/6 the size of the first drink\nSo it had 1/6*3=1/2 the caffeine\nThat means it had 1/2*250=<<250/2=125>>125 grams of caffeine\nSo the total amount of caffeine he drank was 125+250=<<125+250=375>>375 grams\nSo he consumed 375*2=<<375*2=750>>750 grams of caffeine for the day\n#### 750"
