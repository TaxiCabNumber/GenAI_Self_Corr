At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUrsula is working at a marketing firm. She created a 30-second long commercial. Her boss told her that this commercial is too long to air and told her to shorten the commercial by 30%. How long will this commercial be after Ursula makes the desired changes?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate 30% of 30 seconds: 0.30 * 30 seconds = 9 seconds\n\n2. Subtract the calculated time from the original time: 30 seconds - 9 seconds = 21 seconds\n\nI hope it is correct: 21 $seconds$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Ursula's boss want's the commercial to be 30/100 * 30 = <<30/100*30=9>>9 seconds shorter.\nAfter Ursula makes the desired changes, the ad is going to be 30 - 9 = <<30-9=21>>21 seconds long.\n#### 21"
