At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames collects all the fruits from his 2 trees.  Each tree has 20 plants.  Each plant has 1 seed and he plants 60% of those.  How many trees did he plant?",

Seeds planted: (40 seeds) * (60% or 0.60) = 24 seeds\n5. Trees planted: 24 seeds / 1 seed/plant = 24 plants.  Since each plant is a tree, this is the number of trees planted.\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 $trees$\n",
