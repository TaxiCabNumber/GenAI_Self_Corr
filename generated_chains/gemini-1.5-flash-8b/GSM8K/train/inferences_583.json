        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhen it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?",
        "inference": "1. Largest hole leak rate: 3 ounces/minute\n2. Medium hole leak rate: (1/2) * 3 ounces/minute = 1.5 ounces/minute\n3. Smallest hole leak rate: (1/3) * 1.5 ounces/minute = 0.5 ounces/minute\n4. Total leak rate: 3 ounces/minute + 1.5 ounces/minute + 0.5 ounces/minute = 5 ounces/minute\n5. Total leak amount over 2 hours: 5 ounces/minute * (2 hours * 60 minutes/hour) = 5 ounces/minute * 120 minutes = 600 ounces\n\nI hope it is correct: 600 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of one-half that of the largest hole, or 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 ounces per minute.\nThe small-sized hole leaks at a rate of one-third that of the medium-sized hole, or 1.5/3=<<1.5/3=0.5>>0.5 ounces per minute.\nCombined, the three holes leak at a rate of 3+1.5+0.5=<<3+1.5+0.5=5>>5 ounces per minute.\nSince one hour is 60 minutes, two hours is 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nIn total, over the two hours, the three holes will leak a combined 120*5=<<120*5=600>>600 ounces of water.\n#### 600"
