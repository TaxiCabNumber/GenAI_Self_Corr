At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?",

Total used by the first three neighborhoods: 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels.\n5. Barrels left for the fourth neighborhood: 1200 - 850 = 350 barrels.\n\nI hope it is correct: 350 $barrels$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The second neighborhood uses 150 * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 barrels of water.\nThe third neighborhood uses 300 + 100 = <<300+100=400>>400 barrels of water.\nThe first, second, and third neighborhoods together use 150 + 300 + 400 = <<150+300+400=850>>850 barrels of water.\nThus, the fourth neighborhood has 1200 - 850 = <<1200-850=350>>350 barrels of water left for it to use.\n#### 350"
