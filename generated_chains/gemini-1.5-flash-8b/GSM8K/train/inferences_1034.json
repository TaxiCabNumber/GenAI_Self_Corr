At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhen Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese, and she flavors it with one teaspoon of vanilla for every two cups of cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar in her latest cheesecake. How many eggs did she use?",

Vanilla used: 8 cups / 2 cups/teaspoon = 4 teaspoons\n6. Eggs per teaspoon vanilla: 2 eggs\n7. Total eggs: 4 teaspoons * 2 eggs/teaspoon = 8 eggs\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 $eggs$\n",
