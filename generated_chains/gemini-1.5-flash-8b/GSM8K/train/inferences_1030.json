The water cooler initially contains 3 gallons of water, and each Dixie cup holds 6 ounces of water.  If Bill fills one cup of water per each meeting chair, and there are 5 rows of meeting chairs with 10 chairs in each row, then how many ounces of water will be left in the cooler after all cups have been are filled? (There are 128 ounces in a gallon.)",

Convert the initial amount of water in the cooler to ounces: 3 gallons * 128 ounces/gallon = 384 ounces.\n4. Calculate the remaining water: 384 ounces - 300 ounces = 84 ounces.\n\nI hope it is correct: 84 $ounces$\n",
