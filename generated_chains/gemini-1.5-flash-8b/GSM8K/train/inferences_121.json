They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?",

After 4 hours, there are 2 + 6 = 8 people.\n4. The rate of filling is now 250 blocks/hour * 8 people = 2000 blocks/hour.\n5. The time to fill the remaining 4000 blocks is 4000 blocks / 2000 blocks/hour = 2 hours.\n6. The total time is 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: 6 $hours$\n",
