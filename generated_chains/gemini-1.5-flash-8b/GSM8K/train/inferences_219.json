At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLisa is looking to attempt a World Record. She has decided to try and match Joey Chestnut's record of eating 75 full hotdogs, buns included, in 10 minutes. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. How many hotdogs will she have to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record?",

        "ground_truth": "Joey Chestnut ate 75 hotdogs to claim the record and Lisa has eaten 20 hot dogs so far, so she still needs to eat 75-20=<<75-20=55>>55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut.\nLisa has a 10 minute time period to eat the hotdogs and half the time has already passed, which means Lisa has 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 minutes left until the competition is over.\nIf she needs to eat 55 hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnut and there are 5 minutes left in the competition period then she needs to eat 55/5=<<55/5=11>>11 hot dogs per minute to have a chance of tying for a win.\n#### 11"

        "inference": "Lisa ate 20 hotdogs in 5 minutes, which means she ate an average of 20/5 = 4 hotdogs per minute.  She has 5 minutes left and needs to eat 75 - 20 = 55 more hotdogs.  At 4 hotdogs per minute, she can't eat 55 more hotdogs in 5 minutes.\n\nThis means the problem is likely asking for the *minimum* rate she needs to maintain to finish in the remaining time.  She needs 55 hotdogs in 5 minutes, meaning she needs to eat 55/5 = 11 hotdogs per minute.\n\n#### $11$\n",
