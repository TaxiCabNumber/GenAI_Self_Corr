At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAntonio is preparing a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for his family.  His recipe for meatballs calls for 1/8 of a pound of hamburger per meatball.  Antonio has 8 family members, including himself.  If he uses 4 pounds of hamburger to make meatballs, and each member of the family eats an equal number of meatballs, how many meatballs will Antonio eat?",

        "ground_truth": "If one meatball is made from 1/8 pound of hamburger meat, then 4 pounds of hamburger meat will make 4/(1/8)=4*8=<<4/(1/8)=32>>32 meatballs.\n32 meatballs divided amongst 8 family members is 32/8=<<32/8=4>>4 meatballs per family member.\n#### 4"
