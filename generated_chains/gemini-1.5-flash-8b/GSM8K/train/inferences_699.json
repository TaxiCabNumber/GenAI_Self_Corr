At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarla is planning the lunch menu for an elementary school. There are 5 third grade classes with 30 students each, 4 fourth grade classes with 28 students each, and 4 fifth grade classes with 27 students each. Each student gets a hamburger, which costs $2.10, some carrots, which cost $0.50, and a cookie, which cost $0.20. How much does one lunch for all the students cost?",
