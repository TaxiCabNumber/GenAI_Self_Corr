        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLydia has a small pool she uses to bathe her dogs.  When full, the pool holds 60 gallons of water.  She fills her pool using the garden hose, which provides water at the rate of 1.6 gallons per minute.  Unfortunately, her pool has a small hole that leaks water at a rate of 0.1 gallons per minute.  How long will it take for her to fill the pool, in minutes?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the net water gain per minute: 1.6 gallons/minute - 0.1 gallons/minute = 1.5 gallons/minute.\n\n2. Divide the total pool capacity by the net water gain per minute: 60 gallons / 1.5 gallons/minute = 40 minutes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 40 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "With a garden hose that fills at a rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, and a hole that leaks at 0.1 gallons per minute, the net fill rate becomes 1.6-0.1=<<1.6-0.1=1.5>>1.5 gallons per minute.\nTherefore, to fill a 60-gallon pool, it will take 60/1.5=<<60/1.5=40>>40 minutes.\n#### 40"
