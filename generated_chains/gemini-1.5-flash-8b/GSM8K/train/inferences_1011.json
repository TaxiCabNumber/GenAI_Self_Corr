At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA carpenter is building a house. He needs 80 woodblocks to build it. If he has 8 logs that can make five woodblocks each, how many logs does the carpenter still need?",
        "inference": "8 logs * 5 woodblocks/log = 40 woodblocks\n80 woodblocks - 40 woodblocks = 40 woodblocks\n40 woodblocks / 5 woodblocks/log = 8 logs\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 $logs$\n",
