At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn writes 3 stories every week.  Each short story is 50 pages.  He also writes a novel that is 1200 pages each year.  Each sheet of paper can hold 2 pages.  Over 12 weeks, how many reams of paper does he need to buy if a ream contains 500 sheets?",
