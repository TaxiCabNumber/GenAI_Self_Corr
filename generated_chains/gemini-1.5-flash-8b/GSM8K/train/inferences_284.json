At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMatt buys a massager.  At the lowest setting, it vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second.  At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster.  Matt uses it for 5 minutes at the highest setting.  How many vibrations does he experience?",

Add the higher vibration rate to the lowest vibration rate: 1600 vibrations/second + 960 vibrations/second = 2560 vibrations/second.\n3. Convert 5 minutes to seconds: 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds.\n4. Calculate the total vibrations: 2560 vibrations/second * 300 seconds = 768000 vibrations.\n\nI hope it is correct: 768000 $vibrations$\n",
