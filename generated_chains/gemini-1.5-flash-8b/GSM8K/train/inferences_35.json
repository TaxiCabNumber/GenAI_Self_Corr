At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?",

        "ground_truth": "Since 40% of his students got below B, 100% - 40% = 60% of Mr. Sanchez's students got B and above.\nThus, 60 x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 students got B and above in their final grade.\n#### 36"
