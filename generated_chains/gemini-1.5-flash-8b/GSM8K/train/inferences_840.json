At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 4 puppies and 3 dogs at a camp. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, what would be the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day?",
        "inference": "1. A dog eats 4 pounds of food * 3 times a day = 12 pounds of food per day.\n\n2. Since each dog eats twice as much as a puppy, a puppy eats 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds of food per day.\n\n3. A puppy eats 6 pounds of food and eats 3 times a day.  So each puppy eats 6 pounds * 3 times = 18 pounds of food per day.\n\n4. There are 3 dogs, so the total food eaten by dogs is 12 pounds/dog * 3 dogs = 36 pounds.\n\n5. There are 4 puppies, so the total food eaten by puppies is 18 pounds/puppy * 4 puppies = 72 pounds.\n\n6. The total food eaten by dogs and puppies is 36 pounds + 72 pounds = 108 pounds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 108 $pounds$\n",
