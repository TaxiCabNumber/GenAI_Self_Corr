        "ground_truth": "The additional yard Brendan can cut after buying the lawnmower is 8 x 0.50 = <<8*0.50=4>>4 yards.\nSo, the total yards he can cut with the lawnmower is 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nTherefore, the total number of yards he can cut in a week is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 yards.\n#### 84"
