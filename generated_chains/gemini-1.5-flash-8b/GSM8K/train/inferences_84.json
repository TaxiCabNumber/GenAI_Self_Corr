At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHans booked a room in a hotel. The hotel has 10 floors with 10 identical rooms on each floor. Because of an accident, the last floor is unavailable for the guests. Considering there are no other guests, in how many different rooms could Hans be checked in?",
        "inference": "There are 10 floors and 10 rooms on each floor, except for the last floor which is unavailable.  So there are 9 floors with 10 rooms each.  Multiply 9 floors by 10 rooms/floor to get the total number of rooms.\n9 * 10 = 90\n\nI hope it is correct: 90 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The hotel has in total 10 floors * 10 rooms/floor = <<10*10=100>>100 rooms.\nOne floor is unavailable, so Hans could be checked into 100 rooms - 10 rooms = <<100-10=90>>90 available rooms.\n#### 90"
