At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBy the time Anne is two times as old as Emile, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. If Maude will be 8 years old, how old will Anne be?",
        "inference": "1. Let Anne's current age be A, Emile's current age be E, and Maude's current age be M.\n\n2. When Anne is twice as old as Emile, Anne's age will be A + x and Emile's age will be E + x.  We know A + x = 2(E + x).  This simplifies to A + x = 2E + 2x, which means A = 2E + x.\n\n3. At the same time, Emile will be six times as old as Maude. So E + x = 6M. Since we know M = 8,  E + x = 6 * 8 = 48.\n\n4. We now have a system of two equations:\n   * A = 2E + x\n   * E + x = 48\n\n5. Solve for x in the second equation: x = 48 - E\n\n6. Substitute this expression for x into the first equation: A = 2E + (48 - E)\n\n7. Simplify: A = E + 48\n\n8. We know that Maude is 8 years old (M = 8).  From the problem E + x = 6M, we have E + x = 6 * 8 = 48.\n\n9. We don't know the current age of Emile or Anne, but we know that when Anne is twice Emile's age, Emile will be six times Maude's age. This means that when Emile is 48, Maude will be 8 and Anne will be E + 48. We already know that Emile will be 48 years old in that time, so Anne's age will be 48 + 48 = 96.\n\nI hope it is correct: 96 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Maude's age is 8 by the time Anne's age is four times Emile's age, Emile will be six times as old as Maude, which totals 6*8 = 48 years.\nIf Emile's age is 48 years old by the time Anne's age is twice her number, Anne will be 2*48 = <<48*2=96>>96 years.\n#### 96"
