At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA publishing house decides to create a contest for new writers and will award a total of $800 in prizes to the 18 novels with the most votes. First place will get $200, second place will get $150, third place $120 and the rest of the awards will be paid with the same amount of money. How much money will each writer earn from fourth place onwards?",
        "inference": "1. Total prize money: $800\n2. Top 3 prize money: $200 + $150 + $120 = $470\n3. Remaining prize money: $800 - $470 = $330\n4. Number of writers from 4th place onwards: 18 - 3 = 15\n5. Prize money per writer (4th place and onwards): $330 / 15 = $22\n\nI hope it is correct: $22\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first three cash prizes sum to $200 + $150 + $120= $<<200+150+120=470>>470\nThe remaining amount of cash prizes to be distributed is $800 - $470= $<<800-470=330>>330\nThe number of novels left to be awarded is 18 \u2013 3= <<18-3=15>>15 novels\nSo each writer from 4th to 18th will earn $330 / 15= $<<330/15=22>>22\n#### 22"
