At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaisie and Donna dropped off flyers for a neighborhood clean-up day at houses around their neighborhood. Maisie walked down the shorter left street and dropped off 33 flyers. Donna took the long right street on her bicycle and dropped off five more than twice as many flyers as Maisie. How many flyers did Donna drop off?",

        "ground_truth": "Twice as many flyers as Maisie is 33 * 2 = <<33*2=66>>66 flyers.\nDonna dropped off five more than that, so she dropped off 66 + 5 = <<66+5=71>>71 flyers.\n#### 71"
