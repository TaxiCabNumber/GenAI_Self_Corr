At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nConnie is trying to remember when her grandmother was born. She knows her grandmother's older brother was born in 1932, her older sister was born in 1936, and the gap between her grandmother and her sister is twice the gap between the older brother and the older sister.

Gap between grandmother and sister is twice the gap between brother and sister, so it's 2 * 4 = 8 years.\n\n3. Grandma's birth year is 1936 - 8 = 1928.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1928 $answer$\n",
