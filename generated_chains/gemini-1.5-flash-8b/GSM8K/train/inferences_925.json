At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAnn, Becky, and Julia are working at a pharmacy, every day for 8 hours. Each of them is providing service to 7 customers per hour. One day Julia had to finish her work earlier, so she was working only for 6 hours. How many customers did all three of these women serve that day in total?",

Total customers served by Ann and Becky in a day = (8 hours) * (7 customers/hour) * 2 people = 112 customers.\n4. Julia worked for 6 hours.\n5. Julia served (6 hours) * (7 customers/hour) = 42 customers.\n6. Total customers served by all three = 112 customers + 42 customers = 154 customers.\nI hope it is correct: 154 $customers$\n",
