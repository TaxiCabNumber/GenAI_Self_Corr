However, from September to February, Sam was only able to work for 8 hours. If Sam is saving up to buy a video game console that costs $600 and has already spent $340 to fix his car, how many more hours does he need to work before he can buy the video game console?",

Calculate Sam's total savings: $460 + $160 = $620\n\n4. Calculate the amount Sam needs to buy the console: $600\n\n5. Calculate the remaining amount he can use: $620 - $340 = $280\n\n6.
