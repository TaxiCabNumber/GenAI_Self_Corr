At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",

Total commute time per week: 1.6 hours/day * 5 days = 8 hours\n4. Weekend ride time: 200 miles / 25 mph = 8 hours\n5. Total biking time per week: 8 hours + 8 hours = 16 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 16 $hours$\n",
