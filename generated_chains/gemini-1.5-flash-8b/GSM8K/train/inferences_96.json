At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames has a rainwater collection barrel.  For each inch of rain he collects 15 gallons.  On Monday it rained 4 inches and on Tuesday it rained 3 inches.  He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon.  How much money did he make from selling all the water?",
        "inference": "1. Rain on Monday: 4 inches * 15 gallons/inch = 60 gallons\n2. Rain on Tuesday: 3 inches * 15 gallons/inch = 45 gallons\n3. Total gallons collected: 60 gallons + 45 gallons = 105 gallons\n4. Total money made: 105 gallons * $1.2/gallon = $126\n\nI hope it is correct: $126\n",
        "ground_truth": "It rained 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\nSo he collected 7*15=<<7*15=105>>105 gallons\nSo he makes 105*1.2=$<<105*1.2=126>>126 from selling the water\n#### 126"
