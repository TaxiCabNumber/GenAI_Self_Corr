At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFive friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?",

Spaghetti cost: 1 platter * $2.70 = $2.70\n5. Total cost: $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25\n6. Number of friends: 5\n7. Cost per person: $25 / 5 = $5\n\nI hope it is correct: $5\n",
