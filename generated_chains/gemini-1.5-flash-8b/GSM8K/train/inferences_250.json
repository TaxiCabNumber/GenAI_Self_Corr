At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom uses 10 weight plates each weighing 30 pounds on an exercise machine.  This exercise machine uses special technology to make the weights 20% heavier on the lowering portion.  How heavy did the weights feel when being lowered?",

Calculate the increase in weight due to the 20% increase: 300 pounds * 0.20 = 60 pounds\n\n3. Calculate the total weight felt during the lowering portion: 300 pounds + 60 pounds = 360 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 360 $pounds$\n",
