She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?",

Remaining butter: 5 kg - 2 kg = 3 kg\n5. Sugar cookies: (1/3) * 3 kg = 1 kg\n6. Butter left: 3 kg - 1 kg = 2 kg\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 $kg$\n",
