At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLudwig works 7 days a week and he usually works half of the day during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If his daily salary is $10, how much does he earn every week?",

Total days worked per week = 7 (full days) + 3/2 (half days) = 7 + 1.5 = 8.5 days\n3. Earnings per day = $10\n4. Total weekly earnings = 8.5 days * $10/day = $85\n\nI hope it is correct: $85\n",
        "ground_truth": "Ludwig earns a total of $10 x 4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from Monday to Thursday.\nHe earns $10/2= $<<10/2=5>>5 per day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.\nSo, his total salary for Friday, Saturday, Sunday is $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nTherefore, his total weekly salary is $40 + $15 = $<<40+15=55>>55.\n#### 55"
