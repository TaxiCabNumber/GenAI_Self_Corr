He can sell the sweet ones for $.5 an apple. The sour ones sell for $.1 an apple. 75% of the apples he gets are sweet and the rest are sour. If he earns $40, how many apples did his trees give him?",

Revenue from sour apples: 0.25 * total apples * $0.1/apple = $0.025 * total apples\n5. Total revenue: $0.375 * total apples + $0.025 * total apples = $40\n6.
