At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA charcoal grill burns fifteen coals to ash every twenty minutes of grilling. The grill ran for long enough to burn three bags of coals. Each bag of coal contains 60 coals. How long did the grill run?",
        "inference": "1. Coals per bag: 60 coals/bag * 3 bags = 180 coals\n2. Burning time per coal: 20 minutes / 15 coals = 4/3 minutes/coal\n3. Total burning time: 180 coals * (4/3 minutes/coal) = 240 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 240 $minutes$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The grill burned 3 * 60 = <<3*60=180>>180 coals.\nIt takes 20 minutes to burn 15 coals, so the grill ran for 180 / 15 * 20 = <<180/15*20=240>>240 minutes.\n#### 240"
