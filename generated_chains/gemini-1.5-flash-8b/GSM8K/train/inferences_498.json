At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 6 people going on an airplane trip.  They each have 5 bags of luggage.  Each of their bags weighs the maximum weight allowed, 50 pounds.  The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.  How many more bags at maximum weight can the plane hold?",

Remaining weight capacity: 6000 pounds - 1500 pounds = 4500 pounds\n4. Maximum additional bags: 4500 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 90 bags\n\nI hope it is correct: 90 $bags$\n",
