At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA school principal is booking hotel rooms for a class of 30 students to stay at during an overnight field trip.  Each of the hotel's rooms has two queen size beds, which can fit two students each, and a pull-out couch, which can fit one student.  How many rooms does the principal need to book to fit all of the students in the class?",
        "inference": "Rooms with 2 beds = 2 students per room\nRooms with pull-out = 1 student per room\nTotal students = 30\nRooms needed for 2 beds = 30 students / 2 students/room = 15 rooms\nRemaining students = 30 students - (15 rooms * 2 students/room) = 0\nTotal rooms = 15 + 0 = 15 rooms\n\nI hope it is correct: 15 $rooms$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each room can fit 2*2 + 1 = <<2*2+1=5>>5 students.\nThus, the principal needs to book 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6 rooms to fit everyone.\n#### 6"
