At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJay & Gloria were hosting a 4th of July party at their house.  Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36.  They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone.  The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00.  If they wanted all of their guests to have a flag and they also wanted 1 flag each, how much would they spend at the craft store?",
        "inference": "Total guests: 22 + 36 = 58\nFlags needed: 58 + 2 = 60\nNumber of sets of 5 flags: 60 / 5 = 12\nTotal cost: 12 * $1.00 = $12.00\nI hope it is correct: $12\n",
        "ground_truth": "Jay invited 22 guests and Gloria invited 36 so they invited 22+36 = <<22+36=58>>58 guests\nThey also each wanted a flag so in total they would need 1+1+58 = <<1+1+58=60>>60 flags\nThe craft store has them on sale at 5 for $1.00 and they need 60 flags so the flags will cost them 60/5 = $12.00\n#### 12"
