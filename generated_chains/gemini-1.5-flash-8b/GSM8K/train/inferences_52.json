At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArnel had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  He kept ten pencils and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. If his friends got eight pencils each, how many pencils are in each box?",
        "inference": "1. His friends received 8 pencils each, and there are 5 friends, so they received a total of 8 * 5 = 40 pencils.\n2. Arnel kept 10 pencils.\n3. The total number of pencils is 40 + 10 = 50 pencils.\n4.  Arnel had 10 boxes.\n5. Since the number of pencils in each box is the same, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes: 50 pencils / 10 boxes = 5 pencils per box.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5\n",
