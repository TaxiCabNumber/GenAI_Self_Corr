At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPaige bought some new stickers and wanted to share them with 3 of her friends. She decided to share a sheet of 100 space stickers and a sheet of 50 cat stickers equally among her 3 friends. How many stickers will she have left?",
        "inference": "1. Space stickers: 100 stickers / 4 people = 25 stickers per person\n2. Cat stickers: 50 stickers / 4 people = 12 stickers per person with 2 stickers left over.\n3. Total stickers per person: 25 + 12 = 37 stickers\n4. Stickers left over for Paige: 2 stickers\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 $stickers$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Paige has 100 space stickers that she is dividing among 3 friends, so 100 stickers / 3 friends = 33 stickers for each friend, with 1 remaining.\nShe also has 50 cat stickers that she is diving among 3 friends, so 50 stickers / 3 friends = 16 stickers for each friend, with 2 remaining.\nSo Paige will have 1 remaining space sticker + 2 remaining cat stickers = <<1+2=3>>3 stickers left.\n#### 3"
