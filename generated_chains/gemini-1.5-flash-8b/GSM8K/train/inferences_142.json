One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?",

Spray 1 kills 50% and spray 2 kills (25% - 5%) = 20% (of the remaining germs after spray 1)\n5. Total germs killed by both sprays = 50% + (20% of 50%) = 50% + 10% = 60%\n6.
