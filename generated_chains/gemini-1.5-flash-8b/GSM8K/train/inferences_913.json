At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales. To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. If she received a total donation of $310 and adds it to one-half of her profit, how much money did she make above her goal?",

        "ground_truth": "She splits her $960 profit in half to get $960 / 2 = $<<960/2=480>>480.\nShe receives a total donation of $310, so she now has $310 + $480 = $<<310+480=790>>790.\nShe needed only $610 so she has $790 - $610 = $180 more than she needs.\n#### 180"
