At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a northwestern town, it rained 4 inches per day during the first 15 days of November.  For the remainder of the month, the average daily rainfall was twice the amount observed during the first 15 days.  What is the total amount of rainfall for this town in November, in inches?",
        "inference": "1. Rainfall during the first 15 days: 4 inches/day * 15 days = 60 inches\n2. Remaining days in November: 30 days - 15 days = 15 days\n3. Average daily rainfall for the remaining days: 4 inches/day * 2 = 8 inches/day\n4. Rainfall during the remaining days: 8 inches/day * 15 days = 120 inches\n5. Total rainfall in November: 60 inches + 120 inches = 180 inches\n\nI hope it is correct: 180 $answer$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since November has 30 days, the town received 4 inches of rain for the first half of the month for 30/2 = 15 days.\nThe total inches of rain that the town received for the 15 days is 15*4 = <<15*4=60>>60 inches.\nThe rain falling in the town increased by 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 inches per day for the remaining half of the month.\nTherefore, for the rest of the month, the town received 8*15 = <<8*15=120>>120 inches of rain.\nThe total amount of rain the town received in November is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 inches\n#### 180"
