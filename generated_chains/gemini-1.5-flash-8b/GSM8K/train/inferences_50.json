At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies. His season is 4 months long. He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?",

Calculate the monthly savings needed: $400 / (4 months - 4 months playing baseball) = $400/0.  This is undefined.  The problem has an error in the statement. We cannot divide by zero.\n\nI hope it is correct: Undefined\n",
