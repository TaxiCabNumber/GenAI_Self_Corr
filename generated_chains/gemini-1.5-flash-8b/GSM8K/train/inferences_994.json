His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie.  Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza.  Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza.  How many total slices were left over?",

Remaining slices: 6 - 3 = 3 slices.\n3. Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza.  Since each pizza has 12 slices, Sammy ate 12 slices / 3 = 4 slices.\n4. Remaining slices of cheese pizza: 12 - 4 = 8 slices.\n5. Total remaining slices: 3 slices (Hawaiian) + 8 slices (cheese) = 11 slices.\n\nI hope it is correct: 11 $slices$\n",
