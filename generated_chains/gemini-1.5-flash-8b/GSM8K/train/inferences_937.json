At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStella wanted to buy a new dress for the upcoming dance.  At the store she found out that the dress she wanted was $50.  The store was offering 30% off of everything in the store.  What was the final cost of the dress?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the discount amount: 30% of $50 = 0.30 * $50 = $15\n2. Subtract the discount from the original price: $50 - $15 = $35\n\nI hope it is correct: $35\n",
        "ground_truth": "The dress was $50 and 30% off so 50*.30 = $<<50*.30=15>>15 discount price\nThe dress cost $50 minus $15 (30% off discount) so 50-15 = $<<50-15=35>>35\n#### 35"
