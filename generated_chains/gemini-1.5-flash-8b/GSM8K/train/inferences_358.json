At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarl has a jar full of marbles. He takes out 12 marbles to play a game with, but he accidentally drops them and 1/2 the marbles get lost. So Carl takes out 10 more marbles. While he is playing his game his mother comes home with another bag of marbles for him, which has 25 marbles in it. If Carl can't find his lost marbles, then how many marbles is he going to put in the jar after he plays his game, from both his original marbles and the new ones?",
        "inference": "1. Carl starts with an unknown number of marbles (let's call it 'x').\n2. He takes out 12 marbles, leaving x - 12 marbles.\n3. Half of those marbles are lost, meaning (x - 12) / 2 marbles are gone.\n4.  The remaining marbles are (x - 12) - ((x - 12) / 2) = (x - 12) / 2.\n5. He takes out 10 more marbles, leaving (x - 12) / 2 - 10 marbles.\n6. His mother gives him 25 marbles.\n7. Total marbles now are: ((x - 12) / 2) - 10 + 25 = ((x - 12) / 2) + 15\n8.  The problem states that Carl can't find the lost marbles, meaning they are gone. So, the number of marbles to be put back in the jar is the marbles he has after losing some and taking out more, then the additional 25, which are calculated as above.  Since we don't know the original number of marbles, we can't find a definite value.\n\nI hope it is correct: Cannot be determined $\n",
