At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nYou can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?",
        "inference": "1. Oranges cost $0.50 each.\n2. Total fruits = 36, split evenly among oranges, apples, and watermelons.  So, oranges = apples = watermelons = 36/3 = 12.\n3. Total orange cost = 12 oranges * $0.50/orange = $6.\n4. Total cost of apples and watermelons = $66 - $6 = $60.\n5. Apples and watermelons cost the same.\n6. 4 apples = 1 watermelon\n7. So, 12 apples = 3 watermelons.\n8.  Total value of 12 apples and 12 watermelons = $60\n9.  Replacing 3 watermelons with 12 apples: $12 apples + 12 apples = $60. This means 24 apples cost $60.\n10. Cost of 1 apple = $60 / 24 apples = $2.50\nI hope it is correct: $2.50\n",
