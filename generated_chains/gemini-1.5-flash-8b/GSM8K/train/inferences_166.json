        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrandpa Lou enjoys watching movies on the Hallmark channel, where every movie lasts 90 minutes.  If, on Tuesday, he watched several full-length movies on the Hallmark channel for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes, and then on Wednesday he watched on the same channel twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday.  What is the maximum number of full-length movies Grandpa could have watched during these two days?",
        "inference": "4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to 4 * 60 + 30 = 270 minutes.\nThe number of movies watched on Tuesday is 270 / 90 = 3 movies.\nThe number of movies watched on Wednesday is 3 * 2 = 6 movies.\nThe total number of movies watched is 3 + 6 = 9 movies.\nI hope it is correct: 9 $movies$\n",
        "ground_truth": "4 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 4*60+30=<<4*60+30=270>>270 minutes.\nAt 90 minutes per movie, Grandpa could watch a total of 270/90=<<270/90=3>>3 entire movies in 4 hours and 30 minutes.\nOn Wednesday, he watched 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 movies.\nThus, during these two days, he could have watched as many as 3+6=<<3+6=9>>9 movies.\n#### 9"
