        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLuna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget while her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. If the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, how much is Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses?",
        "inference": "1. Food budget = 60% of house rental budget.\n2. Let 'x' be the house rental budget. Then food budget = 0.6x.\n3. Total budget (house rental + food) = x + 0.6x = 1.6x = $240\n4. Solving for x (house rental budget): x = 240 / 1.6 = $150\n5. Food budget = 0.6 * 150 = $90\n6. Phone bill budget = 10% of food budget = 0.1 * 90 = $9\n7. Total monthly budget = house rental + food + phone bill = 150 + 90 + 9 = $249\n\nI hope it is correct: 249 $\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be Luna's house rental budget.\nThe total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.\nThe equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.\nThus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.\nSo, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.\nHer phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.\nTherefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $<<240+9=249>>249.\n#### 249"
