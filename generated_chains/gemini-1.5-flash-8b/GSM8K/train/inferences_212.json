At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRandy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday \u2013 Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?",

Number of weeks practicing per year = 52 - 16 = 36 weeks\n5. Number of days practicing per year = 36 weeks * 5 days/week = 180 days\n6. Total hours needed to become expert = 10,000 hours\n7. Total practicing days = 10,000 hours / 8 hours/day = 1250 days\n8. Total practicing days needed in 8 years = 1250 days\n9. Daily hours of practice = 1250 days / (8 years * 180 days/year) = 1250 / 1440\n10. Daily hours of practice = 0.8681 hours\n11.
