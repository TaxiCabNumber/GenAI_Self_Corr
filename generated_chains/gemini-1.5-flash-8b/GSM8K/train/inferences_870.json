        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMatthew, the baker, arrives at work early every morning to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes for the day.  It usually takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and another 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles.  One day, Matthew's oven failed to reach the correct temperature and it took twice as long for the cakes to bake as they usually take.  On that day, how long did it take, in hours, for Matthew to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes?",
        "inference": "1. Usual baking time: 1.5 hours\n2. Baking time on the faulty oven: 1.5 hours * 2 = 3 hours\n3. Total time: 1 hour (ingredients) + 3 hours (baking) + 1 hour (decorating) = 5 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 $hours$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Twice 1.5 hours is 2*1.5=<<2*1.5=3>>3 hours.\nThus, on that day, it took Matthew 1+3+1=<<1+3+1=5>>5 hours to make the cakes.\n#### 5"
