Their specialty is fresh vegetables.  If they get 500 customers per month, and each customer purchases 2 heads of lettuce for $1 each and 4 tomatoes for $0.5 apiece, then how much money, in dollars, will the store receive in sales of lettuce and tomatoes per month?",

        "ground_truth": "2 heads of lettuce at $1 apiece is 2*$1=$<<2*1=2>>2.\n4 tomatoes at $0.50 apiece is 4*$0.5=$<<4*0.5=2>>2.\nThus, each customer purchases $2+$2=$<<2+2=4>>4 in lettuce and tomatoes per month.\nTherefore, if 500 customers per month spend $4 on lettuce and tomatoes, then the store will receive $4*500=$<<4*500=2000>>2000 per month on sales of lettuce and tomatoes.\n#### 2000"
