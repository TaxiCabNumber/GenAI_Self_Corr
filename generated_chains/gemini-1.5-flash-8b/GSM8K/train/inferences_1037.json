At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn buys a gaming PC for $1200.  He decides to replace the video card in it. He sells the old card for $300 and buys a new one for $500.  How much money did he spend on his computer, counting the savings from selling the old card?",

Total cost of new video card: $500\n6. Total cost of video cards: $500 - $300 = $200\n7. Total cost including savings: $1200 + $200 = $1400\n\nI hope it is correct: $1400\n",
