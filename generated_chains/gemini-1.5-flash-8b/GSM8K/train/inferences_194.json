At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Grey is purchasing gifts for his family. So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for $26 each; 2 necklaces for $83 each; and 1 computer game for $90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a $12 rebate.
