At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSue works in a factory and every 30 minutes, a machine she oversees produces 30 cans of soda. How many cans of soda can one machine produce in 8 hours?",
        "inference": "1.  8 hours is equal to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.\n\n2.  The machine produces 30 cans every 30 minutes.\n\n3.  To find the total cans produced in 480 minutes, divide 480 by 30: 480 / 30 = 16\n\n4.  Therefore, the machine produces 16 * 30 = 480 cans in 8 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: 480 $cans$\n",
