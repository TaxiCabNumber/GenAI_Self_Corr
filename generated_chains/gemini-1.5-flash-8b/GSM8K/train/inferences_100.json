At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?",
