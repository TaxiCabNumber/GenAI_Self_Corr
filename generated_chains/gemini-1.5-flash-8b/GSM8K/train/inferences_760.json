At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSusan wants to throw a party for her mom. She is planning on having 30 guests. For dinner she is making a recipe that makes 2 servings each. Each batch of the recipe calls for 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt. A potato costs $.10 and a container of salt costs $2 at the supermarket. If each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, how much money will Susan spend on food?",
        "inference": "1. Servings needed: 30 guests * 2 servings/guest = 60 servings\n2. Batches needed: 60 servings / 2 servings/batch = 30 batches\n3. Potatoes needed: 30 batches * 4 potatoes/batch = 120 potatoes\n4. Cost of potatoes: 120 potatoes * $0.10/potato = $12.00\n5. Salt needed: 30 batches * 1 teaspoon/batch = 30 teaspoons\n6. Containers of salt needed: 30 teaspoons / 5 teaspoons/container = 6 containers\n7. Cost of salt: 6 containers * $2/container = $12.00\n8. Total cost: $12.00 (potatoes) + $12.00 (salt) = $24.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $24.00\n",
