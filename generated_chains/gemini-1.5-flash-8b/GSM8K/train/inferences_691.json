He arrived in New York 18 hours later. If he took another plane flying to Cape town the day he arrived in New York and arrived in Cape town at 10:00 a.m ET on Tuesday, calculate the number of hours his flight took from New York to cape town.",

Therefore, the flight time from New York to Cape Town is 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m. = 10 hours.\nI hope it is correct: 10 $hours$\n",
