At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4?",
        "inference": "To find the greatest multiple of 3 that is less than 500 and is also a multiple of 4, we need to find the greatest common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4.  The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.  Now we need to find the largest multiple of 12 that is less than 500.  We divide 500 by 12 to find the largest integer multiple:  500 / 12 \u2248 41.67. The largest integer multiple of 12 that is less than 500 is 41 * 12 = 492.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{492}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, the problem amounts to finding the greatest multiple of $3\\cdot4=12$ less than 500. Since $500\\div12=41R8$, our answer is $12\\cdot41=\\boxed{492}$."
