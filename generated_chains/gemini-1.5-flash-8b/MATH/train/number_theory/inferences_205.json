        "inference": "1. We need a four-digit number divisible by 9.\n2. The number must have two even and two odd digits.\n3. The smallest four-digit number is 1000.\n4. Dividing 1000 by 9 gives a quotient of 111 with a remainder of 1.\n5. To get a multiple of 9, we need to add 8 to 1000, which gives 1008. The sum of digits is 1+0+0+8=9.\n6. 1008 has digits 0, 0, 1, 8. This has two zeros, which are even.  It doesn't have two odd digits.\n7. The next number after 1008 is 1017. The digits are 1,0,1,7.  This has one even and three odd.\n8. The next possible number is 1026. The digits are 1,0,2,6.  This has two even (0, 2, 6) and two odd (1).\n9. The next number is 1035. The digits are 1,0,3,5.  This has one even (0) and three odd (1, 3, 5).\n10. The next number is 1044.  This has two evens (0, 4) and two evens (1, 4).\n11. 1053. This has one even (0) and three odd (1, 5, 3).\n12. The next one is 1062. Two even (0, 6) and two odd (1, 2). The sum of the digits is 9. This is divisible by 9.\n13. We look for the smallest such number. We need two even and two odd digits, and the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9.\n14.  1062 is divisible by 9 (sum of digits = 9).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1062}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$."

        "inference": "To find the smallest four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, we need to systematically check numbers.  1000 is the smallest four-digit number.  The next multiple of 9 after 1000 is 1008.  The digits are 1, 0, 0, 8. This has two even (0, 8) and two odd digits. The sum of the digits is 9, so 1008 is divisible by 9.\n\nContinuing, we need to find the smallest such number, so we systematically look for numbers of the form abcd where a, b, c, and d are digits.  We need two even and two odd digits. The smallest four-digit number with two even and two odd digits and divisible by 9 is 1062.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1062}$",
