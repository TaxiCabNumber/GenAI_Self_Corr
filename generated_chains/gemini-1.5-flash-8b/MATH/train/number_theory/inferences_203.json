At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, positive factors does $1100$ have?",
        "inference": "1. Find the prime factorization of 1100.\n$1100 = 11 \\times 100 = 11 \\times 10^2 = 11 \\times (2 \\times 5)^2 = 11 \\times 2^2 \\times 5^2$\n\n2. To find the number of factors, add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and multiply the results.\nThe exponents are 2, 2, and 2.  Adding 1 to each gives 3, 3, and 3.\nNumber of factors = (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$."
