At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6. What is the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12?",

        "ground_truth": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$."
