At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive two-digit number is even and is a multiple of 11. The product of its digits is a perfect cube. What is this two-digit number?",
        "inference": "1. The number is even and a multiple of 11.  Even multiples of 11 are numbers like 22, 44, 66, 88, etc.\n2. The product of its digits must be a perfect cube.  Let the number be represented as AB, where A and B are digits.\n3. Possible even multiples of 11:  22, 44, 66, 88.\n4. Calculate the product of digits for each:\n   - 22: 2 * 2 = 4 (not a perfect cube)\n   - 44: 4 * 4 = 16 (not a perfect cube)\n   - 66: 6 * 6 = 36 (not a perfect cube)\n   - 88: 8 * 8 = 64 = 4^3 (a perfect cube)\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$."
