At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a class of math students lined up for a class picture on Picture Day, they found that when they stood in rows of four there was one person left over. When they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and when they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over. What is the fewest number of students possible in this class?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of students.\nFrom the given information, we have the following congruences:\n$n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n$n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n$n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n\nFrom the first congruence, $n = 4a + 1$ for some integer $a$.\nSubstituting this into the second congruence, we get\n$4a + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$\n$4a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\nMultiplying by 4, we get $16a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, so $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nThis means $a = 5b + 4$ for some integer $b$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $n$, we get\n$n = 4(5b + 4) + 1 = 20b + 16 + 1 = 20b + 17$.\nNow, substituting this into the third congruence, we get\n$20b + 17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$\n$20b \\equiv -14 \\pmod{7}$\n$6b \\equiv -14 \\pmod{7}$\n$6b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. Since gcd(6, 7) = 1, we can divide by 6, to get\n$b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\nThus, $b = 7c$ for some integer $c$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $n$, we get\n$n = 20(7c) + 17 = 140c + 17$.\nThe smallest positive integer value for $n$ occurs when $c = 0$, which gives $n = 17$.\n\nChecking the conditions:\n$17 \\div 4 = 4$ with a remainder of 1.\n$17 \\div 5 = 3$ with a remainder of 2.\n$17 \\div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of 3.\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first two pieces of information imply that the number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 4 and 2 more than a multiple of 5. Checking numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5, we find that 2, 7, and 12 are not 1 more than a multiple of 4, but 17 does satisfy this condition. Moreover, 17 is also three more than a multiple of 7. Thus $\\boxed{17}$ is the least positive integer satisfying all three conditions.\n\nRemark: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers satisfying the given conditions are of the form $17 + \\text{lcm}(4,5,7)k = 17+140k$, where $k$ is an integer."
