        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction $\\frac{1}{129}$?",
        "inference": "To find the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$, we need to perform the division.\n$1 \\div 129 = 0.0077519379...$\nThe first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point is 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we multiply this fraction by 10, we do not change any of the digits; we simply shift all the digits one place to the left. Therefore, if we multiply the fraction by a sufficiently large power of 10, then the first digit obtained when dividing by 129 will be the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$. Observing that $100 < 129 < 1000$, we compute $\\frac{1000}{129}=7 \\frac{97}{129}$. So the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
