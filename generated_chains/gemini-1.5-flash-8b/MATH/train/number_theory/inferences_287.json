At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
        "inference": "We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 840 and 1008.\nFirst, find the prime factorization of 840:\n840 = 84 * 10 = (2^2 * 3 * 7) * (2 * 5) = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\nNext, find the prime factorization of 1008:\n1008 = 1008 / 2 = 504 = 504 / 2 = 252 = 252 / 2 = 126 = 126 / 2 = 63 = 63 / 3 = 21 = 21 / 3 = 7 = 7 / 7 = 1\n1008 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 7\nThe common prime factors are 2 and 7.\nThe smallest powers of these common factors are 2^3 and 7^1.\nSo, the GCD(840, 1008) = 2^3 * 7^1 = 8 * 7 = 56\nThe largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page is 56.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$."
