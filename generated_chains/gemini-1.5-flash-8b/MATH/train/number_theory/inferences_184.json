Their sum is $n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n+3 = 3(n+1)$.\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n+1$ is a positive integer.\nThus, any number in $A$ can be written in the form $3(n+1)$ for some positive integer $n$.\nThe numbers in $A$ are $3(2), 3(3), 3(4), \\dots$. This means the numbers in $A$ are $6, 9, 12, 15, 18, \\dots$.\nThe numbers in the set $A$ are all multiples of 3.\nThe greatest common divisor of the numbers in $A$ is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$\n",
