At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
        "inference": "Since $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, we can write $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nWe want to find the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6.\n$n+2010 = (6k+1) + 2010 = 6k + 2011$.\nWe need to find the remainder when 2011 is divided by 6.\n$2011 \\div 6 = 335$ with a remainder of 1.\nThus, $2011 = 6(335) + 1$.\nSo, $n + 2010 = 6k + 6(335) + 1 = 6(k+335) + 1$.\nThis means that $n+2010$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6."
