To find the day of the week 40 days from Tuesday, we need to find the remainder when 40 is divided by 7.\n3. 40 divided by 7 is 5 with a remainder of 5.\n4. Counting 5 days forward from Tuesday: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.\n5. The 40th day from Tuesday will be a Saturday.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Saturday}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
