        "inference": "1. Integers between 500 and 1000 are 3-digit numbers.\n2. We are looking for integers that contain both the digits 3 and 4.\n3. The integers must have the form $abc$ where $a \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, $b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, and $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.\n4. We need to find the number of integers that contain both 3 and 4.\n5. Total number of 3-digit integers between 500 and 1000 is $9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900$.\n6. Integers that do not contain 3 or 4:\n   * The first digit (a) can be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are 5 choices.\n   * The second and third digits (b and c) can be any digit except 3 and 4. So there are 8 choices for each.\n   * The total number of integers that do not contain 3 or 4 is $5 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 320$.\n7. The number of integers containing both 3 and 4 is the total number of integers minus the number of integers that do not contain 3 or 4.\n8. The number of integers containing both 3 and 4 is $900 - 320 = 580$.\n9. Incorrect.\nTotal integers from 500 to 999 are 900.\nIntegers without 3 or 4 are those formed by digits in {0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9}. There are 8 possibilities for each of the last two digits, and 5 possibilities for the first digit. Thus there are $5 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 320$ such integers.\nNumber of integers that contain both 3 and 4 is $900 - 320 = 580$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{580}$",
        "ground_truth": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number."
