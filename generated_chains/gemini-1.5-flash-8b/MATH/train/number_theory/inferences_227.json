        "inference": "Let's systematically find the smallest palindrome in base 2 that is also a palindrome in base 4, and greater than 5.\n\n1. **Base-2 Palindromes:**  The smallest base-2 palindromes are: 1, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 10101, ...\n   Their base-10 equivalents are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 21, ...\n\n2. **Base-4 Palindromes:** We need to check if the base-10 numbers from step 1 are also palindromes in base 4.\n   * 1 (base 10) is 1 (base 4), a palindrome.\n   * 3 (base 10) is 3 (base 4), a palindrome.\n   * 5 (base 10) is 11 (base 4), a palindrome.\n   * 7 (base 10) is 13 (base 4), not a palindrome.\n   * 9 (base 10) is 21 (base 4), not a palindrome.\n   * 21 (base 10) is 101 (base 4), a palindrome.\n\n\n3. **Checking the Condition:** We need a number greater than 5. The base-10 numbers we've checked are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 21,...  The first one greater than 5 is 7. \n\n   * **7 (base 10):** 13 (base 4) - not a palindrome.\n   * **9 (base 10):** 21 (base 4) - not a palindrome.\n   * **21 (base 10):** 101 (base 4) - a palindrome.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest number that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, and greater than 5,  we must continue checking the base-2 palindromes.  The next palindrome after 21 is 33 (100001 in binary) which converts to 10101 in base 4.\n\n\n21 is a palindrome in both bases 2 and 4, and is greater than 5. The next candidate, 21, works:\n\n4. **Checking 21 (base 10):**  In binary: 10101 (a palindrome). In base 4: 101 (a palindrome).\n\nTherefore, 21 is the smallest such number.\n\n\n$\\boxed{21}$\n",
