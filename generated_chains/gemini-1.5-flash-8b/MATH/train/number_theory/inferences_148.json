At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
        "inference": "To find the possible rectangular arrays of chairs with 36 chairs, we need to find the pairs of factors of 36 that are greater than or equal to 2.  \nFactors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.\nSince the number of chairs in each row and each column must be at least 2, the possible pairs of factors are:\n(2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), (6, 6)\nThe corresponding arrays are:\n2 rows of 18 chairs, 18 rows of 2 chairs\n3 rows of 12 chairs, 12 rows of 3 chairs\n4 rows of 9 chairs, 9 rows of 4 chairs\n6 rows of 6 chairs, 6 rows of 6 chairs\nThere are 4 possible rectangular arrays.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays."
