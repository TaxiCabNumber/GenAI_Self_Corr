At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{12}{37}$ is expressed as a decimal?",

        "ground_truth": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
