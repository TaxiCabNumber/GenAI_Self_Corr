At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the base four equivalent of $123_{10}$?",
        "inference": "1. Divide 123 by 4: $123 \\div 4 = 30$ with a remainder of 3.\n2. Divide 30 by 4: $30 \\div 4 = 7$ with a remainder of 2.\n3. Divide 7 by 4: $7 \\div 4 = 1$ with a remainder of 3.\n4. Divide 1 by 4: $1 \\div 4 = 0$ with a remainder of 1.\n5.

        "ground_truth": "We know that $4^{4}>123_{10}>4^{3}$. So, we can tell that $123_{10}$ in base four will have four digits. $4^{3}=64$, which can go into 123 only one time at most, leaving $123-1\\cdot64 = 59$ for the next three digits. $4^{2}=16$ goes into 59 three times at most, leaving us with $59-3\\cdot16 = 11$. Then, $4^{1}=4$ goes into 11 two times at most, leaving $11-2\\cdot4 = 3$ for the ones digit. All together, the base four equivalent of $123_{10}$ is $\\boxed{1323_{4}}$."
