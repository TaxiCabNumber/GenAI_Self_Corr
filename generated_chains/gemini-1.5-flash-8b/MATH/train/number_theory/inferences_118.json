I hope it is correct.'\nA proposal will make years that end in double zeroes a leap year only if the year leaves a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. Under this proposal, how many leap years will there be that end in double zeroes between 1996 and 4096?",

        "ground_truth": "We start with 1800, a multiple of 900, and add 200 to get 2000. So 2000 has a remainder of 200 when divided by 900.
