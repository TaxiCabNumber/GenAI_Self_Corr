        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday. School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
        "inference": "September has 30 days.  Since September 4 is a Monday, the Mondays in September are:\n9/4, 9/11, 9/18, 9/25.\nOctober has 31 days.  The first Monday in October is October 2.  The following Mondays are October 9, October 16, October 23, October 30.\nSo, October has 5 Mondays.\nThus, the first Marvelous Monday is October 30.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{October 30}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$."
