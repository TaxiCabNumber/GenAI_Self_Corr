At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou are given that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$. What are the last three digits of $3^{12000}$?",

        "ground_truth": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$."
