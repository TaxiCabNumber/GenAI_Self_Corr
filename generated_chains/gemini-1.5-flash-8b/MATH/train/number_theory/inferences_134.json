I hope it is correct.'\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of members in the band.\nIf the members are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied. This means the number of members is of the form $8x+2$ for some integer $x$.\nIf the members are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. This means the number of members is of the form $9y+3$ for some integer $y$.\nSo $8x+2 = 9y+3$.\n$8x = 9y+1$.\nWe are looking for a number $n$ between 100 and 200.\nWe have $8x+2=9y+3$, which means $8x=9y+1$.\nWe need to find integer values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation and $100 < n < 200$.\nLet's try some values of $x$:\nIf $x=1$, $8(1)=9y+1$, $7=9y$. This doesn't have an integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=2$, $8(2)=9y+1$, $15=9y$. This doesn't have an integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=3$, $8(3)=9y+1$, $23=9y$.

This doesn't have an integer solution for $y$.\nIf $x=8$, $8(8)=9y+1$, $63=9y$. $y=7$. So $n=8(8)+2=64+2=66$. This is less than 100, so not a solution.\nIf $x=9$, $8(9)=9y+1$, $71=9y$.

        "ground_truth": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.
