At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaniel has exactly $20$ pieces of candy. He has to divide them equally among his $3$ sisters. What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
        "inference": "1. Divide the total number of candies by the number of sisters: $20 \\div 3 = 6$ with a remainder of 2.\n2. This means each sister gets 6 candies, and there are 2 candies left over.\n3. To distribute the candy equally, Daniel needs to take away the remainder: $2$ candies.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces."
