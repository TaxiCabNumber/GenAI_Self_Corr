At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe least common multiple of two integers is 36 and 6 is their greatest common divisor. What is the product of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be a and b.\nWe are given that the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b is 36, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is 6.\nWe know that the product of two integers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD.\nThus, a * b = LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b).\nIn this case, a * b = 36 * 6.\na * b = 216\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{216}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$."
