At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "1/13 = 0.076923076923...\nThe repeating block is 076923.\nThe length of the repeating block is 6.\nWe want the 43rd digit after the decimal point.\n43 divided by 6 is 7 with a remainder of 1.\nThe 1st digit in the repeating block is 0.\nThe 7th block will have the same digits as the 1st block.\nThus, the 42nd digit is 3.\nThe 43rd digit is the same as the 1st digit.\nThe 1st digit in the repeating block is 0+7+6+9+2+3=27.\nThe 1st digit after the decimal is 0.\nThe 43rd digit is 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer."
