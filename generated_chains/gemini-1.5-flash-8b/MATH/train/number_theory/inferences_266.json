At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPalindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665. What is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3?",
        "inference": "1. We are looking for a four-digit palindrome divisible by 3.\n2. The smallest four-digit palindrome is 1001.\n3. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\n4. For 1001, the sum of the digits is 1+0+0+1 = 2, which is not divisible by 3.\n5. The next four-digit palindrome is 1111, with a digit sum of 4, not divisible by 3.\n6. The next four-digit palindrome is 1221, with a digit sum of 6, divisible by 3.\n7.
