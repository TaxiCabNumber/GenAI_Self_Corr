Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$."
