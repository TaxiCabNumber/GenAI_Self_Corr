At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation?",

The largest 5-digit binary number is 11111, which is $2^4+2^3+2^2+2^1+2^0 = 16+8+4+2+1 = 31$.  The next binary number is 100000, which is $2^5 = 32$.\n\nThus, the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation is 32.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
