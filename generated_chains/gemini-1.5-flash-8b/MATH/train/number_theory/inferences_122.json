Find the multiples of 24 less than 200. Multiples of 24 are: 24, 48, 72, ..., 192. The number of multiples is $\\frac{192}{24} = 8$.\n3. Find the common multiples of 18 and 24.  The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 24 is found by prime factorizing: $18 = 2 \\times 3^2$ and $24 = 2^3 \\times 3$.  So, LCM(18, 24) = $2^3 \\times 3^2 = 8 \\times 9 = 72$.\n4. Find the common multiples of 18 and 24 less than 200.  Multiples of 72 are: 72, 144.  There are 2 common multiples.\n5. The total number of possible pairs of integers chosen is $11 \\times 8 = 88$.\n6. The probability of selecting the same number is the number of common multiples divided by the total number of possible pairs, which is $\\frac{2}{88} = \\frac{1}{44}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$\n",

Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers).
