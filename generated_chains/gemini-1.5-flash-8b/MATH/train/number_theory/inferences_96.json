        "inference": "The problem states that $d > 1$ is a common factor of $9n-2$ and $7n+3$.  Thus, we are looking for the values of $n$ that make $9n-2$ and $7n+3$ divisible by the same common factor greater than 1.  From the Euclidean Algorithm, the common divisor is 41, and this is the only common divisor greater than 1.\n\nWe need to find $n$ such that $9n-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$ and $7n+3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{41}$.  The first congruence becomes $9n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{41}$, which is equivalent to $9n \\equiv 43 \\pmod{41}$, or $9n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{41}$. Multiplying by 5, we get $45n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{41}$, or $4n \\equiv 10 \\pmod{41}$.  Multiplying by 10, we get $40n \\equiv 100 \\pmod{41}$, so $-n \\equiv 18 \\pmod{41}$, or $n \\equiv -18 \\equiv 23 \\pmod{41}$.\nThus, $n = 41k + 23$ for some non-negative integer $k$.  The smallest such value is $n = 23$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{23}$",
