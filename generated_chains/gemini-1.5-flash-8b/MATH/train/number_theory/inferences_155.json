        "inference": "To determine for how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates, we need to find the values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{475}$ has a finite decimal representation. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction, in lowest terms, has only powers of 2 and 5 as prime factors. We have $475 = 5^2 \\times 19$. Thus, for the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ to terminate, $n$ must be a multiple of 19.  We need $n$ to be an integer between 1 and 474. The multiples of 19 between 1 and 474 are $19, 38, 57, \\dots, 474$.\nWe want to find the largest integer multiple of 19 less than or equal to 474.

        "ground_truth": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5.

There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal."
