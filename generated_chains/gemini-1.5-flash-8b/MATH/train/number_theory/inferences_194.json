Also, one of the numbers is 180, say a = 180. We need to find the value of b.\n\n2. We know that for any two numbers a and b, the product of the LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers:\n   LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b\n\n3. Substituting the given values, we have:\n   3780 * 18 = 180 * b\n\n4. Calculating the product:\n   68040 = 180 * b\n\n5. Solving for b:\n   b = 68040 / 180\n\n6. Dividing 68040 by 180:\n   b = 378\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{378}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
