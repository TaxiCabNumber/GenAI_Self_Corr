        "inference": "A number is divisible by 33 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 11.\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\nThe sum of the digits of $\\underline{7n933}$ is $7+n+9+3+3 = 22+n$.\nFor $22+n$ to be divisible by 3, $n$ must be either 2, 5, or 8.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11.\nThe alternating sum of the digits of $\\underline{7n933}$ is $7-n+9-3+3 = 16-n$.\nFor $16-n$ to be divisible by 11, $16-n$ can be 0 or 11.\nIf $16-n=0$, then $n=16$, but $n$ is a single digit, so this is not possible.\nIf $16-n=11$, then $n=5$.\n\nSince $n=5$ satisfies both conditions, the number is divisible by 33.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$."
