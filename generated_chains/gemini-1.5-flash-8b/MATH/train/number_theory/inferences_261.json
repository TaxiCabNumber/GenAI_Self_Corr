At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "We are looking for the greatest whole number less than 100 that has an odd number of positive factors.\nA number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square.\nThe perfect squares less than 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\nThe greatest perfect square less than 100 is 81.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$."
