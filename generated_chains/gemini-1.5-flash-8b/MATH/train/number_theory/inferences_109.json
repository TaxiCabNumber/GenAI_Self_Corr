Consider $b=3$: we look for integers $n=a^3$. $1^3=1, 2^3=8, 3^3=27, \\ldots, 12^3=1728$. These are all oddly powerful. $13^3=2197>2010$. So there are 12 such integers.\n4.

So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010.
