I hope it is correct.'\nAn ellipse has foci $(2, 2)$ and $(2, 6)$, and it passes through the point $(14, -3).$ Given this, we can write the equation of the ellipse in standard form as \\[\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\\]where $a, b, h, k$ are constants, and $a$ and $b$ are positive. Find the ordered quadruple $(a, b, h, k)$.\n\n(Enter your answer as an ordered list, for example, \"1, 3, -9, 2\".)",

The center is the midpoint of the foci, which is $(2, 4)$.\nSo $h = 2$, $k = 4$.\nThe distance between the foci is $6 - 2 = 4$, so $2c = 4$ and $c = 2$.\nThe point $(14, -3)$ lies on the ellipse. The distance from the foci to the point $(14, -3)$ is $d_1$ and $d_2$.\n$d_1 = \\sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-5)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13$.\n$d_2 = \\sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + (-9)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 81} = \\sqrt{225} = 15$.\nThe sum of the distances from the foci to any point on the ellipse is $2a = 13 + 15 = 28$. Thus $a = 14$.\nSince $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we have $2^2 = 14^2 - b^2$.\n$4 = 196 - b^2$.\n$b^2 = 192$.\n$b = \\sqrt{192} = 8\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, the equation is\n$$\\frac{(x-2)^2}{14^2} + \\frac{(y-4)^2}{192} = 1.$$\nThe ordered quadruple is $(14, 8 \\sqrt{3}, 2, 4)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(14, 8 \\sqrt{3}, 2, 4)}$",

Putting all this together, we get the equation of the ellipse: \\[\\frac{(x-2)^2}{(8\\sqrt3)^2} + \\frac{(y-4)^2}{14^2} = 1. \\]Thus, $(a, b, h, k) = \\boxed{ (8\\sqrt3, 14, 2, 4)}.$"
