At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the domain of the function $g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ ?  Enter your answer using interval notation.",
        "inference": "To find the domain of the function $g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$, we need to identify the values of $x$ for which the function is defined.  A rational function is undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Thus, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n$x+8 = 0$\n$x = -8$\nThe value $x = -8$ makes the denominator zero, so the function is undefined at $x = -8$.  Therefore, the domain of the function consists of all real numbers except $x = -8$.  In interval notation, this is written as $(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, \\infty)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, \\infty)}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The formula for $g(x)$ has a defined value unless its denominator is $0$; thus we must exclude $-8$ from the domain.  The domain of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, \\infty)}$."
