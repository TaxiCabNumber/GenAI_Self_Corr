At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the graph of $\\frac{x^2+3x+2}{x^3+x^2-2x}$, let $a$ be the number of holes in the graph, $b$ be the number of vertical asympotes, $c$ be the number of horizontal asymptotes, and $d$ be the number of oblique asymptotes. Find $a+2b+3c+4d$.",

Simplify the expression:\n$$ \\frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{x(x+2)(x-1)} = \\frac{x+1}{x(x-1)}, \\quad \\text{for } x \\neq -2 $$\n\n3. Identify holes:\nA hole occurs when a factor cancels out. In this case, the factor $(x+2)$ cancels out. Thus, there is a hole at $x=-2$.\nTo find the y-value of the hole, plug $x=-2$ into the simplified expression:\n$$ \\frac{-2+1}{(-2)(-2-1)} = \\frac{-1}{(-2)(-3)} = \\frac{-1}{6} $$\nSo, the hole is at $(-2, -1/6)$.\nThe number of holes is $a = 1$.\n\n4. Identify vertical asymptotes:\nVertical asymptotes occur when the denominator is zero and the numerator is not zero. The denominator is zero when $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nThe numerator is nonzero at these values. Thus, there are vertical asymptotes at $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nThe number of vertical asymptotes is $b = 2$.\n\n5. Identify horizontal asymptotes:\nThe degree of the numerator is 2, and the degree of the denominator is 3. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$.\nThe number of horizontal asymptotes is $c = 1$.\n\n6. Identify oblique asymptotes:\nSince the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator by exactly 1, there are no oblique asymptotes.\nThe number of oblique asymptotes is $d = 0$.\n\n7. Calculate $a+2b+3c+4d$:\n$a+2b+3c+4d = 1 + 2(2) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 1 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$",

There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=2$. If we cancel out the common factors we have\n$$\\frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{x(x-1)(x+2)} =\\frac{x+1}{x^2-x}.$$We can now see that as $x$ becomes very large, the $x^2$ term in the denominator dominates and the graph tends towards $0$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.\nSince the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$.
