        "inference": "The parabola has vertex at $(0,0)$ and focus at $(0,1)$.  The equation of the parabola is $x^2 = 4py$, where $p=1$. So $x^2 = 4y$.  Since $P$ is in the first quadrant, $x, y > 0$.\nThe distance from $P(x,y)$ to the focus $F(0,1)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (y-1)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2}$.\nWe are given that $PF = 101$.\nThus $\\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2} = 101$.
