At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind $q(x)$ if the graph of $\\frac{x^3-2x^2-5x+3}{q(x)}$ has vertical asymptotes at $2$ and $-2$, no horizontal asymptote, and $q(3) = 15$.",
        "inference": "The vertical asymptotes occur when the denominator $q(x)$ is zero and the numerator is nonzero.  The vertical asymptotes are at $x=2$ and $x=-2$. This means $q(x)$ must have $(x-2)$ and $(x+2)$ as factors. So, $q(x) = k(x-2)(x+2) = k(x^2-4)$ for some constant $k$.\nWe are given that $q(3) = 15$.  Substituting $x=3$ into $q(x) = k(x^2-4)$, we get\n$$q(3) = k(3^2-4) = k(9-4) = 5k = 15.$$\nSolving for $k$, we find $k=3$.  Therefore, $q(x) = 3(x^2-4) = 3x^2-12$.\n\nFor a rational function to have no horizontal asymptote, the degree of the numerator must be at least one greater than the degree of the denominator.\nThe numerator is $x^3-2x^2-5x+3$.\nThe degree of the numerator is 3.\nThe degree of the denominator is 2.\nThis means the degree of the denominator is one less than the degree of the numerator.  Thus, the requirement that there is no horizontal asymptote is satisfied.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3x^2-12}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since the given function has vertical asymptotes at $2$ and $-2$, we know that $q(2) = q(-2) = 0$ (i.e. $2$ and $-2$ are roots of $q(x)$). Moreover, since the given function has no horizontal asymptote, we know that the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than the degree of the numerator, which is $3$.\n\nHence, $q(x)$ is a quadratic with roots $2$ and $-2$. In other words, we can write it as $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-2)$ for some constant $a$.  Since $q(3) = 15$, we have $a(3+2)(3-2) = 15$.\n\nSolving for $a$ gives $a = 15/5 = 3$. Hence $q(x) = 3(x-2)(x+2) = \\boxed{3x^2 - 12}$."
