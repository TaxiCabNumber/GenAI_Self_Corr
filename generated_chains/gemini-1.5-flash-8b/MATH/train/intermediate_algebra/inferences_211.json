In this case, $|r_i| = |\\bar{r_i}|$.\nThus, for each pair of non-real roots, the absolute values of the roots are the same.\nSo, for the distinct values to be 1006, there must be 1006 distinct positive real numbers.\nThus, for each pair of non-real roots $r_i$ and $\\bar{r_i}$, we have $|r_i| = |\\bar{r_i}|$, and this counts as one distinct value.\nSince there are 1006 distinct values, this means there are 1006 distinct values of the absolute values of the roots.\nConsider the case where there are 1006 distinct positive real values and no non-real roots. This means there are 1006 distinct values of $|r_i|$, so the number of distinct real values is 1006.\nThus, 1006 roots have distinct absolute values. The total number of roots is 2006. If there are no non-real roots, there are 2006 real roots. But each root has an absolute value, so each real root has a distinct value of $|r_i|$.\nSince the distinct values are 1006, there must be 1006 distinct values among the absolute values.\nThe minimum number of real roots is when there are 1006 distinct positive values of $|r_i|$.\nSuppose that 1006 values are distinct, so there are $2 \\cdot 1006 = 2012$ possible values.\nSince there are 1006 distinct values of $|r_i|$, and 2006 roots, this means that for every root $r_i$ where $|r_i|$ is one of the distinct values, we have one real root or two non-real roots. So, there must be pairs of non-real roots, with the same magnitude.\nFor each pair of non-real roots, the absolute value is the same.

If $n$ is the number of magnitudes $|r_i|$ that correspond to nonreal roots, then $f(x)$ has at least $2n$ nonreal roots, which means it has at most $2006 - 2n$ real roots.\n\nAlso, this leaves $1006 - n$ magnitudes that correspond to real roots, which means that the number of real roots is at least $1006 - n.$  Hence,\n\\[1006 - n \\le 2006 - 2n,\\]so $n \\le 1000.$  Then the number of real roots is at least $1006 - n \\ge 6.$\n\nThe monic polynomial with roots $\\pm i,$ $\\pm 2i,$ $\\dots,$ $\\pm 1000i,$ 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006 satisfies the conditions, and has 6 real roots, so the minimum number of real roots is $\\boxed{6}.$"
