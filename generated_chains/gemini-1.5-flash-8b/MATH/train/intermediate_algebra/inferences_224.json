At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ellipse has its foci at $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3).$ Given that it passes through the point $(4, -2),$ its equation can be written in the form \\[\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1\\]where $a, b, h, k$ are constants, and $a$ and $b$ are positive. Find $a+k.$",
        "inference": "The distance between the foci is $|-1 - (-1)| = 2$ and $|-3 - (-1)| = 2$. Thus, the foci are at $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3).$ The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the foci, which is $(-1, -2).$\nThus, $h = -1$ and $k = -2.$\nThe distance from $(-1, -2)$ to $(-1, -3)$ is $|-3 - (-2)| = |-1| = 1,$ which is the value of $c.$\nThe distance from $(-1, -2)$ to $(4, -2)$ is $|4 - (-1)| = 5,$ which is the value of $a.$\n$a^2 = 25.$\nSince $a^2 = b^2 - c^2,$ we have $25 = b^2 - 1,$ so $b^2 = 26.$\nThe equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{(x+1)^2}{25} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{26} = 1.$\n$a+k = 5 + (-2) = 3.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the distances from $(4, -2)$ to the foci of the ellipse is \\[\\sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-1+2)^2} + \\sqrt{(4+1)^2 + (-3+2)^2} = 2\\sqrt{26}.\\]This is also equal to the length of the major axis of the ellipse. Since the distance between the foci is $2,$ it follows that the length of the minor axis of the ellipse is $\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{26})^2 - 2^2} = 10.$\n\nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment containing points $(-1, -1)$ and $(-1, -3),$ which is $(-1, -2).$ Since the two foci have the same $x$-coordinate, the vertical axis is the major axis. Putting all this together, we get that the equation of the ellipse is \\[\\frac{(x+1)^2}{5^2} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{(\\sqrt{26})^2} = 1.\\]Thus, $a+k = 5 + (-2) = \\boxed{3}.$"
