Now, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n$3 \\times \\frac{11}{6} = \\frac{3 \\times 11}{6} = \\frac{33}{6}$.\nNow we simplify the fraction $\\frac{33}{6}$. We find the greatest common divisor of 33 and 6, which is 3.\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 3 gives $\\frac{33 \\div 3}{6 \\div 3} = \\frac{11}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$\n",
