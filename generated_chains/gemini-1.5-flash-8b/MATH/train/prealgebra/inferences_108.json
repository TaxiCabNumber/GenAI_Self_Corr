At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of irises to roses in Nikki's garden is 2:5. She currently has 25 roses. She is planning to add 20 more roses and enough irises to keep the same ratio. How many irises will she have in total after this addition?",
        "inference": "1. The ratio of irises to roses is 2:5.\n2. Currently, she has 25 roses.\n3. This means 25 roses correspond to 5 parts of the ratio.\n4. 1 part of the ratio corresponds to 25 roses / 5 = 5 roses.\n5. The number of irises corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio.\n6. Currently, she has 2 parts * 5 roses/part = 10 irises.\n7. She is adding 20 more roses.\n8. The total roses will be 25 + 20 = 45 roses.\n9. The new ratio of irises to roses will still be 2:5.\n10. 45 roses correspond to 5 parts of the ratio.\n11. 1 part of the ratio corresponds to 45 roses / 5 = 9 roses.\n12. The number of irises corresponds to 2 parts of the ratio.\n13. The number of irises will be 2 parts * 9 roses/part = 18 irises.\n14. Total irises after the addition will be 18.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "After adding 20 roses, Nikki will have $25+20=45$ roses.  If she will have 2 irises for every 5 roses, then she will have $2(9)=\\boxed{18}$ irises."
