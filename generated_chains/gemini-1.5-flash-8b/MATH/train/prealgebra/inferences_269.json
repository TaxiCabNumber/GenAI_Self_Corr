At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle with the measure of angle $A$ equal to 90 degrees. The length of segment $AC$ is 6 cm. What is the area of triangle $ABC$, in square centimeters?",
        "inference": "Since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle with angle A = 90 degrees, AC = 6 cm, we know that AC = AB = 6 cm.\nThe area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height.\nIn this case, the base and height are the legs of the right triangle, which are AC and AB.\nArea = (1/2) * AC * AB = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18 square cm.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
