At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree positive integers have an arithmetic mean of 26 and median of 27. If the median is 5 less than the largest number, what is the smallest number?",
        "inference": "Let the three positive integers be $a, b, c$ in increasing order.\nThe arithmetic mean of the three integers is 26, so $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 26$.\nThus, $a+b+c = 78$.\nThe median is 27, so $b = 27$.\nThe median is 5 less than the largest number, so $c = b+5 = 27+5 = 32$.\nSubstituting $b=27$ and $c=32$ into the equation $a+b+c=78$, we get\n$a+27+32=78$,\n$a+59=78$,\n$a=78-59=19$.\nThe smallest number is $a=19$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The median of three integers is the middle integer. So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$. We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\\times3=78$. We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\\boxed{19}$."
