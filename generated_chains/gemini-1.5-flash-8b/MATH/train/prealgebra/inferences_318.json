        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has an area of 400 $\\text{cm}^2$. If the rectangle is a square, what is its perimeter?",
        "inference": "1. If the rectangle is a square, then its length and width are equal.\n2. Let the side length of the square be 's'.\n3. The area of a square is given by the formula: Area = side \u00d7 side = s\u00b2\n4. We are given that the area is 400 $\\text{cm}^2$.\n5. Therefore, s\u00b2 = 400.\n6. Taking the square root of both sides, we get s = \u221a400 = 20 cm.\n7. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: Perimeter = 4 \u00d7 side = 4s\n8. Substituting the value of s, we get Perimeter = 4 \u00d7 20 = 80 cm.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $s$ is the side of the square, then $s^2=400$.  Therefore, $s=20$.  The perimeter is $4(20)=\\boxed{80}$ cm."
