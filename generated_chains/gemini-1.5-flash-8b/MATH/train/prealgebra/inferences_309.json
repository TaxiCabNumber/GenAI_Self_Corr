At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of degrees in the measures of the interior angles of a convex pentagon are five consecutive integers. What is the number of degrees in the largest angle?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a convex pentagon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180, where n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, n = 5, so the sum is (5-2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.\n\nLet the five consecutive integers be x, x+1, x+2, x+3, and x+4. Their sum is 5x + 10.\n\nSince the sum of the interior angles is 540 degrees, we have:\n5x + 10 = 540\n5x = 530\nx = 106\n\nThe largest angle is x + 4 = 106 + 4 = 110 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{110}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose we list the angle measures in increasing order.  Let $x$ be the measure of the middle angle in degrees. Then, the five angles have measures $x -2^\\circ$, $x-1^\\circ$, $x$, $x + 1^\\circ$, and $x+2^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so \\[(x -2^\\circ)+(x-1^\\circ)+(x)+(x + 1^\\circ) +(x+2^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x = 540^\\circ$, and dividing both sides by 5 gives $x = 108^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $x + 2^\\circ = \\boxed{110^\\circ}$."
