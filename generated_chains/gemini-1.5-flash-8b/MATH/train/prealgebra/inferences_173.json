At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of 12, 21 and $x$ is 18.

        "inference": "The average of 12, 21, and $x$ is 18.  The average is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.  Thus, we have $\\frac{12 + 21 + x}{3} = 18$.\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get $12 + 21 + x = 18 \\times 3 = 54$.\nCombining the constants, we have $33 + x = 54$.\nSubtracting 33 from both sides, we get $x = 54 - 33$.\n$x = 21$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$\n",
