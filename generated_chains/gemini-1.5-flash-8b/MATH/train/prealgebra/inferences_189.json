        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a particular right triangle, the two legs have lengths of 40 inches and 42 inches. What is the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "1. Recall the formula for the area of a right triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n\n2. In a right triangle, the legs are the base and height.\n\n3. Area = (1/2) * 40 inches * 42 inches\n\n4. Area = 20 inches * 42 inches\n\n5. Area = 840 square inches\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{840}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a right triangle is half the product of the lengths of its legs. Thus, the area of the triangle is $$(1/2)(40)(42) = \\boxed{840\\text{ square inches}}.$$"
