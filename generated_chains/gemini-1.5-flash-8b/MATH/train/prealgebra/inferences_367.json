At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAuston is 60 inches tall. Using the conversion 1 inch = 2.54 cm, how tall is Auston in centimeters? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

Nonetheless, we don't want to change the quantity, only the units -- we must look for a ratio of units which is equal to one.\n\nSince $1 \\mbox{ inch} = 2.54 \\mbox{ cm}$, we can divide by sides by 1 inch to find  $$\\frac{2.54\\mbox{ cm}}{1\\mbox{ in}} = 1.$$\n\nSo, Auston is $$60\\mbox{ in} \\cdot \\frac{2.54 \\mbox{ cm}}{1 \\mbox{ in}} = \\boxed{152.4}\\mbox{ cm}$$ tall."
