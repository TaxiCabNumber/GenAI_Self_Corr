At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sorcerer is concocting a healing potion. In order to do so, he must have one of three roots, and one of five minerals. However, one of the minerals is incompatible with two of the roots. Otherwise, he does not foresee any complications with other combinations of roots and minerals. In how many ways can he brew his potion?",
        "inference": "There are 3 roots and 5 minerals.\nIf the minerals are compatible with all the roots, there are $3 \\times 5 = 15$ possible combinations.\nHowever, one mineral is incompatible with two of the roots.\nSo, we subtract the number of incompatible combinations from the total number of combinations.\nIf one mineral is incompatible with two roots, that means there are 2 roots that cannot be used with that mineral.\nThus, there are $3-2=1$ root that can be used with that mineral.\nThere are $1 \\times 1 = 1$ incompatible combination for each of the 2 incompatible roots.\nSo, there are 2 combinations to subtract.\nThe total number of ways to brew the potion is the total number of combinations minus the incompatible combinations.\nThe total number of combinations without the incompatible mineral is $3 \\times 5 - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
