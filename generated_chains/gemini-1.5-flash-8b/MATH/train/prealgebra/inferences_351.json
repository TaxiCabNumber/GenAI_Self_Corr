At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
        "inference": "There are 3 choices for president.\nOnce the president is chosen, there are 2 choices left for secretary.\nOnce the president and secretary are chosen, there are 1 choice left for treasurer.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose the three officers is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings."
