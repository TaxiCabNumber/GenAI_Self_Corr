At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA state requires that all boat licenses consist of the letter A or M followed by any five digits. What is the number of groups of letters and numbers available for boat licenses?",
        "inference": "There are 2 choices for the first letter (A or M).\nThere are 10 choices for each of the five digits (0-9).\nThe number of choices for the five digits is 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10^5 = 100,000.\nThe total number of groups of letters and numbers available for boat licenses is 2 * 100,000 = 200,000.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200000}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two choices for the letter, followed by ten choices of a digit for each of the next five slots. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 10^5 = \\boxed{200000}$ combinations."
