At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow much greater, in square inches, is the area of a circle of radius 20 inches than a circle of diameter 20 inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. Area of a circle with radius 20 inches:  $A_1 = \\pi r^2 = \\pi(20^2) = 400\\pi$ square inches.\n\n2. Diameter of the second circle is 20 inches, so its radius is $r_2 = 20/2 = 10$ inches.\n\n3. Area of the circle with diameter 20 inches: $A_2 = \\pi r_2^2 = \\pi(10^2) = 100\\pi$ square inches.\n\n4. Difference in areas: $A_1 - A_2 = 400\\pi - 100\\pi = 300\\pi$ square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{300\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "A circle of diameter 20 inches has radius 10 inches.  Thus the difference in the areas of these two circles is $20^2\\pi - 10^2\\pi = \\boxed{300\\pi}$ square inches."
