At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA trapezoid has one base equal to twice its height, $x$, and the other base is three times as long as the height. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of the height $x$.",
        "inference": "The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height.\nThe first base is 2x.\nThe second base is 3x.\nThe height is x.\nArea = (1/2) * (2x + 3x) * x\nArea = (1/2) * (5x) * x\nArea = (5/2) * x^2\nArea = (5x^2)/2\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5x^2}{2}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{2x+3x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{5x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$."
