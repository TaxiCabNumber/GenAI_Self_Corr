At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA suitcase lock has 3 dials with the digits $0, 1, 2,..., 9$ on each. How many different settings are possible if all three digits have to be different?",
        "inference": "There are 10 digits to choose from for the first dial.\nSince the digits must be different, there are 9 digits to choose from for the second dial.\nAnd there are 8 digits to choose from for the third dial.\nTherefore, the total number of different settings is $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

After the first digit has been chosen, there are 9 possibilities for the second digit, and after the first two digits have been chosen there are 8 possibilities for the last digit.
