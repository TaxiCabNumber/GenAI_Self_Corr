        "inference": "To find the largest positive multiple of 12 that is less than 350, we need to find the largest integer $n$ such that $12n < 350$.  Dividing 350 by 12, we get $350 \\div 12 \\approx 29.1667$.  Since $n$ must be an integer, the largest integer value for $n$ is 29.  Then $12 \\times 29 = 348$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{348}$",
