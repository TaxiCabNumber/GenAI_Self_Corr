At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sign painter paints individual numerals for a row of 50 houses. The houses are numbered with consecutive integers from 1 to 50. How many 9s are painted?",
        "inference": "Houses numbered 1 to 50.\nWe need to count the number of 9s painted.\nThe numbers with 9 in the units place are 9, 19, 29, 39, 49. There are 5 such numbers.\nThe numbers with 9 in the tens place are 90, 91, ..., 99. But the house numbers are from 1 to 50, so there are no numbers with 9 in the tens place.\nThus, the only numbers with 9 in them are 9, 19, 29, 39, and 49.\nThere are 5 houses with 9 in the units place.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For every ten consecutive integers 1-10, 11-20, and so on until 50, there is one 9 painted. Since there are 5 sets of ten consecutive integers, there are $\\boxed{5}$ nines painted."
