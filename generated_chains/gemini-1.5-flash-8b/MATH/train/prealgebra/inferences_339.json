At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square inches, of a right triangle with a 24-inch leg and a 25-inch hypotenuse?",
        "inference": "1. We know the area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n2. In this case, the legs are the base and height.\n3. We have one leg (base) = 24 inches and the hypotenuse = 25 inches.\n4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the other leg (height).\n   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n   24\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 25\u00b2\n   576 + b\u00b2 = 625\n   b\u00b2 = 625 - 576\n   b\u00b2 = 49\n   b = 7 inches\n5. Now we have both legs: base = 24 inches and height = 7 inches.\n6. Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 24 * 7 = 12 * 7 = 84 square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The other leg is $\\sqrt{25^2-24^2}=\\sqrt{625-576}=\\sqrt{49}=7$. The area is $\\frac12\\cdot24\\cdot7=12\\cdot7=\\boxed{84}$ square inches."
