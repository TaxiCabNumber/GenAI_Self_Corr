At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn recently bought a used car for $\\$5000$ for his pizza delivery job. He gets $\\$10$ for each pizza he delivers, but he has to spend $\\$3$ on gas for each pizza he delivers. What is the minimum whole number of pizzas John must deliver in order to earn back the money he spent on the car he bought?",
        "inference": "Cost of car = $5000\nEarnings per pizza = $10\nCost per pizza (gas) = $3\nProfit per pizza = $10 - $3 = $7\nLet 'x' be the number of pizzas needed to earn back the cost of the car.\n7x = 5000\nx = 5000 / 7\nx \u2248 714.2857\nSince the number of pizzas must be a whole number, round up to the next whole number.\nx = 715\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{715}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ be the number of pizzas he bought. He makes $10p$ dollars selling $p$ pizzas, but he spends $3p$ dollars on gas. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n10p-3p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge \\frac{5000}{7} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge 714\\frac{2}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, John must sell at least $\\boxed{715}$ pizzas to earn back the $\\$5000$ he spent on the car."

        "inference": "To earn back the cost of the car, the total earnings must equal the cost of the car.  The profit per pizza is $7.  So, 7x = 5000, and x = 5000/7 \u2248 714.29.  Since you can't sell a fraction of a pizza, you need to round *up* to the next whole number to ensure you have enough earnings to cover the cost of the car.  Therefore, you need to sell 715 pizzas.\n\n$\\boxed{715}$\n",
