At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam and Simon start on bicycle trips from the same point at the same time. Adam travels east at 8mph and Simon travels south at 6mph. After how many hours are they 60 miles apart?",
        "inference": "Let $d_A$ be the distance Adam travels and $d_S$ be the distance Simon travels.\nAdam travels east at 8 mph for $t$ hours, so $d_A = 8t$.\nSimon travels south at 6 mph for $t$ hours, so $d_S = 6t$.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the distance between Adam and Simon is $\\sqrt{d_A^2 + d_S^2} = \\sqrt{(8t)^2 + (6t)^2}$.\nWe are given that the distance between them is 60 miles, so we have the equation\n$\\sqrt{(8t)^2 + (6t)^2} = 60$\n$\\sqrt{64t^2 + 36t^2} = 60$\n$\\sqrt{100t^2} = 60$\n$10t = 60$\n$t = 6$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ hours.

        "ground_truth": "If Adam travels east and Simon travels south, then their paths are perpendicular and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be $60$ miles apart. Then Adam has traveled $8x$ miles and Simon has traveled $6x$ miles. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(8x)^2+(6x)^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\sqrt{100x^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10x&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6.\n\\end{align*}They are $60$ miles apart after $\\boxed{6}$ hours."
