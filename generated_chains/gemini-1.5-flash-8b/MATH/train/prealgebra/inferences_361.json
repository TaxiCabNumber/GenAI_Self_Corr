At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAcme Corporation has released an alphabet soup in which each of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U) of the English alphabet appears five times (and the consonants do not appear at all). How many five-letter words can be formed from a bowl of Acme Vowel Soup? (Note: The words do not have to be actual words in English!)",
        "inference": "There are 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U), each appearing 5 times.\nWe want to form 5-letter words.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 letters from 5 vowels, each appearing 5 times, is the number of ways to arrange 5 letters from the 5 available vowels.\nThis is a permutation problem with repetition.\nThe formula for permutations with repetitions is $\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\\cdots n_k!}$, where $n$ is the total number of objects and $n_i$ is the number of times the $i$-th object is repeated.\nIn this case, $n = 5$, and each vowel appears 5 times, so $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = n_5 = 5$.\nThis is not applicable because the number of each vowel is 5.\nInstead, we consider the case where each vowel appears once.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 letters from 5 vowels, where each vowel appears once, is $5^5 = 3125$.\nThe possible choices are:\nAAAAB\nAAAAE\n...\nUUUUU\n\nIn this case, we have 5 distinct vowels, each appearing 5 times.\nWe want to form a 5-letter word.\nWe need to choose 5 letters from the 5 available vowels.\nThe number of ways to choose 5 vowels is $\\binom{5 \\times 5}{5}$.\nHowever, the number of letters of each vowel is not important.\nWe have 5 vowels, each appearing 5 times.\nSo there are 5 choices for each position.\nWe have 5 positions to fill.\nThe first position can be filled by any of the 5 vowels.\nThe second position can be filled by any of the 5 vowels.\nAnd so on.\nThe total number of possible words is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^5 = 3125$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3125}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Clearly there are 5 choices for the first letter. Although it is tempting to think that there are 4 choices for the second letter, reading the problem carefully, we see that in the process of picking our five letters, we will never run out of any of our vowels, since there are five sets of each vowel. Therefore, we just multiply 5 by itself five times to get $5^5 = \\boxed{3125}.$"
