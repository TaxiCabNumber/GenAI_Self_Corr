Area of a 12-inch pizza: A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(6\u00b2) = 36\u03c0 square inches.\n3. Difference in area: 36\u03c0 - 25\u03c0 = 11\u03c0 square inches.\n4. Percent increase: (11\u03c0 / 25\u03c0) * 100% = (11/25) * 100% = 44%.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{44%}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the 10-inch pizza is $5^2\\pi = 25\\pi$ square inches, while the area of the 12-inch pizza is $6^2\\pi = 36\\pi$ square inches.  The increase is $36\\pi-25\\pi=11\\pi$. As a factor, this is an increase of $\\frac{11\\pi}{25\\pi} = \\frac{44}{100} = \\boxed{44\\%}$."
