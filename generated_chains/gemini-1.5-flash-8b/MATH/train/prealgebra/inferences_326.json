        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the mean value of the measures of the three interior angles of any triangle?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees.\nThere are three interior angles.\nThe mean value is the sum of the angles divided by the number of angles.\nMean = (180 degrees) / 3 = 60 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by the total number of numbers.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, and there are 3 angles.  Hence their mean is $\\frac{180^\\circ}{3} = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$."
