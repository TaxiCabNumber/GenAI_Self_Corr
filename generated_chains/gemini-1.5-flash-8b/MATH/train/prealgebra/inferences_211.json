At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmma had just been given some coins by her parents.  On the way to school she lost exactly half of them, and then by retracing her steps she found exactly four-fifths of the coins she had lost.  What fraction of the coins that she received from her parents were still missing after Emma retraced her steps? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
