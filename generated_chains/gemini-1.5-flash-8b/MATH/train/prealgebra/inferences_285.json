At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of the 40 members of a computer science camp is 17 years. There are 20 girls, 15 boys, and 5 adults. If the average age of the girls is 15 and the average age of the boys is 16, what is the average age of the adults?",
        "inference": "1. Total age of all members: 40 members * 17 years/member = 680 years\n\n2. Total age of girls: 20 girls * 15 years/girl = 300 years\n\n3. Total age of boys: 15 boys * 16 years/boy = 240 years\n\n4. Total age of adults: 680 years (total) - 300 years (girls) - 240 years (boys) = 140 years\n\n5. Average age of adults: 140 years / 5 adults = 28 years\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$ years. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of all ages is $40\\times 17=680$. The sum of the girls' ages is $20\\times 15=300$ and the sum of the boys' ages is $15\\times 16=240$. The sum of the five adults' ages is $680-300-240=140$. Therefore, their average is $\\frac{140}{5}=\\boxed{28}$."
