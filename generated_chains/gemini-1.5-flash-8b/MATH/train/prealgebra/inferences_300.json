At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe figure shown consists of a right triangle and two squares. If the figure's total area equals 850 square inches, what is the value of $x$ in inches?

        "inference": "1. The area of the right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  The base is $2x$ and the height is $5x$.  So the area of the triangle is (1/2) * (2x) * (5x) = 5x\u00b2.\n\n2. The area of the square with side length $2x$ is $(2x)^2 = 4x^2$.\n\n3. The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the triangle and the two squares.  We are given that the total area is 850 square inches.  Therefore, $5x^2 + 4x^2 = 850$.\n\n4. Combining like terms, we get $9x^2 = 850$.\n\n5. Dividing both sides by 9 gives $x^2 = \\frac{850}{9} = \\frac{850}{9}$.\n\n6. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{850}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{850}}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{25 \\times 34}}{3} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{34}}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5\\sqrt{34}}{3}}$ inches.
