In particular, $a$ can be written as $2\\cdot(2m)$ and therefore is even (recall that being a multiple of 2 is the same as being even).

We are told that $a$ is a multiple of 4. Also, $b$ is eight times $n$ for some integer $n$, which means that $b=4\\cdot(2n)$ is also a multiple of 4. Since the sum of two multiples of 4 is again a multiple of 4, we see that $a+b$ is a multiple of 4. So statement B is true.\n\nC. If we take $a=12$ and $b=8$, we see that $a+b=20$ is not a multiple of 8. Thus statement C is false.\n\nD. If we take $a=16$ and $b=16$, then $a+b=32$ is a multiple of 8.
