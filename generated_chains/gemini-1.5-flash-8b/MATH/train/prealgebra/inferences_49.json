At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of butter:flour:sugar in a recipe is 1:6:4. When using 8 cups of sugar in this recipe, how many total cups of these three ingredients will be used?",
        "inference": "1. The ratio of butter:flour:sugar is 1:6:4.\n2. If 8 cups of sugar are used, then the sugar part of the ratio is multiplied by 2 (8/4 = 2).\n3. To find the butter and flour amounts, multiply the corresponding parts of the ratio by 2:\n   - Butter: 1 * 2 = 2 cups\n   - Flour: 6 * 2 = 12 cups\n4. The total cups of ingredients is the sum of butter, flour, and sugar:\n   - Total: 2 + 12 + 8 = 22 cups\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have that in every recipe, there is 1 part butter to 6 parts flour to 4 parts sugar. That is identical to saying that there are $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ parts butter to $2 \\cdot 6 = 12$ parts flour to $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ parts sugar. If each part is a cup, then there must be 12 cups flour and 2 cups butter used. In total, there are $12+2+8=\\boxed{22}$ total cups of ingredients used."
