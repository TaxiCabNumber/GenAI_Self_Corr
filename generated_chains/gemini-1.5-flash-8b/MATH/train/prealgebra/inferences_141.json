        "inference": "1. Distribute the 3 on the left side: $3r - 21$\n2. Distribute the 4 on the right side: $8 - 8r + 4$\n3. Combine like terms on the right side: $12 - 8r$\n4. Set the expressions equal to each other: $3r - 21 = 12 - 8r$\n5. Add $8r$ to both sides: $11r - 21 = 12$\n6. Add 21 to both sides: $11r = 33$\n7.

        "ground_truth": "Expanding both products gives \\[3r - 3\\cdot 7 = 4\\cdot 2 - 4\\cdot 2r + 4,\\] so $3r - 21 = 8 - 8r + 4$.  Simplifying the right-hand side gives $3r -21 = 12-8r$.  Adding $8r$ and 21 to both sides gives $11r = 33$, so $r=\\boxed{3}$."
