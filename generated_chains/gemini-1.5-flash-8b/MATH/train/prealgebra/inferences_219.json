        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKenton watched 2000 adult men and women board a cruise ship. Half of the adults were women. If 20$\\%$ of the women and 9$\\%$ of the men were wearing sunglasses, what was the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses?",
        "inference": "1. Number of women: 2000 adults / 2 = 1000 women\n2. Number of men: 2000 adults - 1000 women = 1000 men\n3. Women wearing sunglasses: 1000 women * 0.20 = 200 women\n4. Men wearing sunglasses: 1000 men * 0.09 = 90 men\n5. Total wearing sunglasses: 200 women + 90 men = 290 people\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{290}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men.  Thus, $20\\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses."
