        "inference": "Let $L$ be the number of lemons required to make $G$ gallons of lemonade.\nWe are given that $24$ lemons are required to make $32$ gallons of lemonade.\nThis can be written as the ratio $\\frac{24 \\text{ lemons}}{32 \\text{ gallons}}$.\nWe want to find the number of lemons needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade.\nLet $x$ be the number of lemons needed for $4$ gallons of lemonade.\nWe can set up a proportion:\n$\\frac{24 \\text{ lemons}}{32 \\text{ gallons}} = \\frac{x \\text{ lemons}}{4 \\text{ gallons}}$\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n$32x = 24 \\times 4$\n$32x = 96$\nDividing both sides by $32$, we get:\n$x = \\frac{96}{32}$\n$x = 3$\nSo, $3$ lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The proportion of lemons to gallons of lemonade must always remain constant.
