At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a circle is $49\\pi$ square units. What is the radius of the circle, in units?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius.\nWe are given that the area of the circle is $49\\pi$.\nSo, we have $49\\pi = \\pi r^2$.\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get $49 = r^2$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $r = \\sqrt{49}$ or $r = - \\sqrt{49}$.\nSince the radius must be positive, we have $r = 7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of a circle is $\\pi \\cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot r^2 = 49\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\\boxed{7}$ units."
