I hope it is correct.'\nA dealer sold 200 cars, and the data for some of those sales are recorded in this table. If the rest of the cars she sold were Hondas, how many Hondas did she sell?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ |c | c|}\n\\hline \\textbf{Type of Car} & \\textbf{$\\%$ of Total Cars Sold} \\\\ \\hline\nAudi & $15\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\nToyota & $22\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\nAcura & $28\\%$ \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total percentage of cars sold that were Audi, Toyota, and Acura: 15% + 22% + 28% = 65%\n2. Calculate the percentage of cars sold that were Hondas: 100% - 65% = 35%\n3. Calculate the number of Hondas sold: 35% of 200 cars = (35/100) * 200 = 70\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{70}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The percentage of cars sold that were Hondas is $100-15-22-28=35$ percent. Since there are 200 total cars, $200\\cdot 0.35=\\boxed{70}$ cars are Hondas."
