At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJar A has exactly four red buttons and eight blue buttons.  Carla then removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from Jar A and places them in an empty Jar B.  Jar A now has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of its original number of buttons.  If Carla were now to randomly choose a button from Jar A and a button from Jar B, what is the probability that the two chosen buttons will both be red?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
