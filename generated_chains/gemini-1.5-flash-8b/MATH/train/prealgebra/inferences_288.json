At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJavier is going to Disneyland during spring break. He plans on visiting four particular attractions all before lunch. In how many orders could he visit all four attractions once?",
        "inference": "1. We have 4 attractions to visit.\n2. For the first attraction, Javier has 4 choices.\n3. For the second attraction, Javier has 3 choices left.\n4. For the third attraction, Javier has 2 choices left.\n5. For the fourth attraction, Javier has 1 choice left.\n6. The total number of orders is the product of the number of choices at each step: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 ways to choose which to visit first, then 3 ways to choose which to visit next, then 2 ways to choose where to go after that, and then 1 way to choose where to go last.  This gives a total of $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ possible orders."
