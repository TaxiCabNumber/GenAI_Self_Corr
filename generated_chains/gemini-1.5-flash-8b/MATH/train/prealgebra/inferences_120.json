At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diagonal lengths of a rhombus are 24 units and 10 units. What is the area of the rhombus, in square units?",

        "ground_truth": "The area of a rhombus can be expressed as: $\\frac{d_1 d_2}{2}$, where $d_1 , d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals.  (Think of each quadrant as a triangle, and sum those areas - you'll see it comes out to this formula)  Plugging in $d_1 = 24$ and $d_2 = 10$, we get $\\frac{24\\cdot 10}{2} = \\boxed{120}$ square units."
