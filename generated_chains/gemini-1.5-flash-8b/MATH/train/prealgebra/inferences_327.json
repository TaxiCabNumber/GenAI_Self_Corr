        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJimmy notices $7$ oranges weigh the same as $5$ apples.  If Jimmy has $28$ oranges, how many apples would Jimmy need to equal the weight of his $28$ oranges?",
        "inference": "1.  7 oranges weigh the same as 5 apples.  This means the ratio of oranges to apples is 7:5.\n\n2.  We can find the equivalent ratio for 28 oranges.  Divide 28 by 7 to find the scale factor: 28 / 7 = 4.\n\n3.  Multiply the number of apples by the scale factor: 5 apples * 4 = 20 apples.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the weight of $7$ oranges is equal to the weight of $5$ apples, Jimmy needs only $5$ apples for every $7$ oranges in order for their weight to be equal.  So Jimmy needs $\\frac{5}{7} \\times 28=\\boxed{20}$ apples.\n\nNote: Read the problem carefully! It does not say that the ratio of the number of oranges to apples is 7:5. It says the ratio of the weight of oranges to apples is 7:5. This is a huge difference!"
