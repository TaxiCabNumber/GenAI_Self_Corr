        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCarolyn and Paul are playing a game starting with a list of the integers $1$ to $n.$ The rules of the game are:\n\n$\\bullet$  Carolyn always has the first turn.\n\n$\\bullet$  Carolyn and Paul alternate turns.\n\n$\\bullet$  On each of her turns, Carolyn must remove one number from the list such that this number has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list.\n\n$\\bullet$  On each of his turns, Paul must remove from the list all of the positive divisors of the number that Carolyn has just removed.\n\n$\\bullet$  If Carolyn cannot remove any more numbers, then Paul removes the rest of the numbers.\n\nFor example, if $n=6,$ a possible sequence of moves is shown in this chart:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nPlayer & Removed \\# & \\# remaining \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & 4 & 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 1, 2 & 3, 5, 6 \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & 6 & 3, 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 3 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & None & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 5 & None \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNote that Carolyn can't remove $3$ or $5$ on her second turn, and can't remove any number on her third turn.\n\nIn this example, the sum of the numbers removed by Carolyn is $4+6=10$ and the sum of the numbers removed by Paul is $1+2+3+5=11.$\n\nSuppose that $n=6$ and Carolyn removes the integer $2$ on her first turn. Determine the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes.",

The only such number is $6,$ so Carolyn removes $6$ and so Paul removes the remaining positive divisor of $6$ (that is, $3$), to leave the list $4,$ $5.$ Carolyn cannot remove either of the remaining numbers as neither has a positive divisor other than itself remaining.\n\nThus, Paul removes $4$ and $5.$\n\nIn summary, Carolyn removes $2$ and $6$ for a sum of $2+6=\\boxed{8}$ and Paul removes $1,$ $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ for a sum of $1+3+4+5=13.$"
