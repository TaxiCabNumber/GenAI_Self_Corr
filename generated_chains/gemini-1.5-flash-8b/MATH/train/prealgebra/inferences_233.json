        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward, for example 313 or 1001. Ignoring the colon, how many different palindromes are possible on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes? (Notice a zero may not be inserted before a time with a single-digit hour value. Therefore, 01:10 may not be used.)",
        "inference": "1. The hours can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\n2. The minutes can be 00, 01, 02, ..., 59.\n3. A palindrome has the form HH: MM, where HH reads the same backward as forward.  Since we are ignoring the colon, the palindrome has the form HHMM.\n4. For the hours, we can have 1, 2, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12. For single digits, we have 1, 2, ..., 9. For double digits, we have 10, 11, 12.\n5. For the minutes, we must form a palindrome of the form AB BA.  Thus, we can have the digits from 0 to 5 (for minutes).  00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55 are the only possible minutes.  The minutes can also be 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. \n6.

For hours 1-9 we have 9 possible palindromes (01-09) + (10, 21, 32, 43, 54) = 9 + 5 = 14\n   For hours 10, 11, 12 we have 3 * 6  (10, 21, 32, 43, 54, 55)  \n10. 9(6) + 3(6) = 54\n11. 9(6) + 3(6) = 54\n12. 9 + 5 * 3 = 9 + 15 = 24\n13. 9 * 6 + 3 * 6 + 6 = 54 + 18 + 6 = 78\n14. Total possible palindromes = 9 * 6 + 3 * 6 = 54 + 18 = 72\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}$",
        "ground_truth": "First, consider the three-digit palindromes.  There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$.  There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$.  The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit.  So there are $9 \\cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes.\n\nSecond, consider the four-digit palindromes.  The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$.  There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$.  The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit.

        "inference": "The correct approach is to consider single-digit and double-digit hours separately for minutes.\n\nSingle-digit hours (1-9):  For each hour HH, the possible palindromes are MM = 01, 10, 22, 33, 44, 55.
