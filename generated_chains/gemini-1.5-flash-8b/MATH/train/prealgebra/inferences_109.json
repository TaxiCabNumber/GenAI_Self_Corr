At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure of an angle, in degrees, if its supplement is six times its complement?",
        "inference": "Let the angle be x.\nThe supplement of the angle is 180 - x.\nThe complement of the angle is 90 - x.\nWe are given that the supplement is six times the complement.\nSo, 180 - x = 6(90 - x)\n180 - x = 540 - 6x\n180 - 540 = -6x + x\n-360 = -5x\nx = 72\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the angle measure $x$. We are given that $180^{\\circ}-x=6(90^{\\circ}-x)$. This expands to $180^{\\circ}-x=540^{\\circ}-6x$ or $5x=360^{\\circ}$ and $x=\\boxed{72^{\\circ}}$."
