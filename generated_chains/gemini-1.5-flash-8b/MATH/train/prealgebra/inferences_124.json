Calculate the sum of the scores for the last two tests: 405 - 231 = 174.\n4. Possible pairs of scores that sum to 174: (89, 85), (88, 86), (87, 87), ... (80,94).\n5. Since each score is an integer less than 90 and all scores are different, the pairs must contain scores that are not already included in the first 3 scores (88, 73, 70).\n6. The pairs that satisfy the above conditions and sum to 174 are (89, 85), (88, 86), (87, 87), ...\n7. Check the pairs:\n    * (89, 85): Both are less than 90 and different from the first three.\n    * (88, 86): Both are less than 90 and different from the first three.\n    * (87, 87): Score repeats, which is not allowed.\n8.

Keeping in mind that each test score was less than 90, this means that Trisha got scores of 87 and 87, 88 and 86, or 89 and 85 on her last two tests.\n\nSince all of Trisha's scores are different integer values, she can't have gotten scores of 87 and 87 on her last two tests. Also, since she already got an 88 on a test, she can't have gotten scores of 88 and 86 either. This means that she must have gotten scores of 89 and 85 on her last two tests.\n\nThus, Trisha's scores are 88, 73, 70, 89, and 85.
