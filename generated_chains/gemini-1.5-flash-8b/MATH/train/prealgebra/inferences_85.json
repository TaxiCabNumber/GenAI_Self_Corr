        "inference": "The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.  Let the diagonals be d1 = 6 and d2 = 8.  The rhombus is divided into four congruent right triangles. The legs of these right triangles are half the lengths of the diagonals, which are 6/2 = 3 and 8/2 = 4.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the side length of the rhombus (s) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.  Since a rhombus has four equal sides, the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The rhombus is split into four congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has a leg of $\\frac{6}{2}=3$ inches and another leg of $\\frac82=4$ inches. We use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that $3$ and $4$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$, so the length of the hypotenuse is $5$ inches. Each side of the rhombus is $5$ inches long, so the perimeter is $4(5)=\\boxed{20}$ inches."
