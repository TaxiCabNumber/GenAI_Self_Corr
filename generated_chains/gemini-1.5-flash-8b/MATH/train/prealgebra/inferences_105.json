At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a state contest, 21 Mathletes stay in the same hotel. Each Mathlete gets his/her own room and the room numbers are 1 through 21. When all the Mathletes have arrived, except the ones staying in rooms 12 and 13, what is the median room number of the other 19 Mathletes?",

The median of a set of numbers is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.\nWith 19 Mathletes, the median is the $\\frac{19+1}{2} = 10^{th}$ room number.\nThe room numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 11, 14, 15, ..., 21.\nThe 10th room number in the ordered list is 10.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.",
