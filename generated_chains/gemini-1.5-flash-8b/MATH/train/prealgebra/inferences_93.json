At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRoslyn has ten boxes. Six of the boxes contain pencils, three of the boxes contain pens, and two of the boxes contain both pens and pencils. How many boxes contain neither pens nor pencils?",

However, this counts twice the 2 boxes with both pens and pencils, so we subtract 2 from our total to only count these boxes once.  That gives us $6+3-2=7$ boxes with pens or pencils, which leaves $10-7=\\boxed{3\\text{ boxes}}$ with neither."
