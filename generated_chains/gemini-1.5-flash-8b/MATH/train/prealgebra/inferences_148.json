        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMing and Catherine walked to the store together to buy some pencils.  Ming bought $40$ pencils and Catherine bought $24$.  If each package of pencils sold at the store contain the same number of pencils, what is the largest possible number of pencils in a package?",
        "inference": "To find the largest possible number of pencils in a package, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 40 and 24.\n\nThe factors of 40 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.\nThe factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nThe common factors of 40 and 24 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.\nThe greatest common factor is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the number of pencils in a package must be a divisor of both $24$ and $40$, the largest possible number of pencils in a package is the GCD of $40$ and $24$.  Factoring, $24 = 2^3\\cdot 3$ and $40 = 2^3\\cdot 5$.  The only prime common to both factorizations is $2$, raised the $3$rd power, so the GCD is $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$."
