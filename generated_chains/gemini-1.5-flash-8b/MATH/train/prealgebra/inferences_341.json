        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrea notices that the 40-foot tree next to her is casting a 10-foot shadow. How tall, in inches, is Andrea if she is casting a 15-inch shadow at the same time?",
        "inference": "1. Set up a proportion relating the height of the tree to its shadow and the height of Andrea to her shadow.\n   Tree height / Tree shadow = Andrea height / Andrea shadow\n\n2. Convert all units to feet.\n   40 feet / 10 feet = Andrea height / 1.25 feet\n\n3. Solve for Andrea's height in feet.\n   Andrea height = (40 feet * 1.25 feet) / 10 feet = 5 feet\n\n4. Convert Andrea's height from feet to inches.\n   Andrea height = 5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 60 inches\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\\text{ feet})/(10\\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\\times 15\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{60}$ inches tall."
