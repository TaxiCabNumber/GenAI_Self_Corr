        "inference": "The sum of the angles around each vertex is 360 degrees.  There are three vertices.  Thus, the sum of the angles around the three vertices is 3 * 360 = 1080 degrees.  However, the angles are duplicated.  The sum of the angles in the three triangles is 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.  The sum of the three exterior angles at each vertex is 360 degrees.  Each interior angle is counted twice in the sum of the angles in the three triangles. Therefore, the sum of the six angles is 540 degrees.\n\nThe sum of the angles around each vertex is 360 degrees.  There are three vertices.   This means that the total of all angles around all the vertices is 3 * 360 = 1080 degrees. However, this counts each angle twice, once for each triangle that the angle is in.  The sum of angles of the three triangles is 540 degrees.
