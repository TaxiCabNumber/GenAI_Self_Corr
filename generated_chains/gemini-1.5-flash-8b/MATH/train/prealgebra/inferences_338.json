        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nExpress this sum as a common fraction: $.\\overline{8} + .\\overline{2}$",
        "inference": "Let $x = .\\overline{8} = 0.888...$. Then $10x = 8.888...$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $10x - x = 8.888... - 0.888...$, which simplifies to $9x = 8$. Thus, $x = \\frac{8}{9}$.\n\nLet $y = .\\overline{2} = 0.222...$. Then $10y = 2.222...$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $10y - y = 2.222... - 0.222...$, which simplifies to $9y = 2$. Thus, $y = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\nNow we need to find $x + y = \\frac{8}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{8+2}{9} = \\frac{10}{9}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{9}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
