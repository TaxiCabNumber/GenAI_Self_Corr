        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe distance between two cities on a map is 15 inches. If the scale is 0.25 inches = 3 miles, how many miles apart are the actual cities?",
        "inference": "1.  We know that 0.25 inches on the map represent 3 miles in reality.\n\n2.  We have 15 inches on the map.\n\n3.  To find the equivalent distance in miles, we set up a proportion:\n    (0.25 inches) / (3 miles) = (15 inches) / (x miles)\n\n4.  Cross-multiply to solve for x:\n    0.25 * x = 15 * 3\n    0.25x = 45\n\n5.  Divide both sides by 0.25:\n    x = 45 / 0.25\n    x = 180\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$ miles. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If 0.25 inches represents 3 miles, we have that 1 inch represents 12 miles. Therefore, 15 inches represents $\\boxed{180\\text{ miles}}$."
