If the perimeter of each of these five rectangles is 36 inches, what is the perimeter of the square, in inches?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,5));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,5));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,5));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "Let the width of each rectangle be $w$ and the length be $l$.\nSince the square is divided into 5 congruent rectangles, the length of the square is $5w$ and the width of the square is $l$.\nThe perimeter of each rectangle is $2(w+l) = 36$.\nThus $w+l = 18$.\nThe width of the square is $l$ and the length of the square is $5w$. Since the figure is a square, we have $l=5w$.\nSubstitute $l = 5w$ into the equation $w+l = 18$:\n$w+5w = 18$\n$6w = 18$\n$w = 3$\nNow, $l = 5w = 5(3) = 15$.\nThe side length of the square is $5w = 15$ inches.\nThe perimeter of the square is $4 \\times \\text{side length} = 4 \\times 15 = 60$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square.  Then the dimensions of each rectangle are $s\\times\\frac{s}{5}$.  The perimeter of one of the rectangles is $s+\\frac{s}{5}+s+\\frac{s}{5}=\\frac{12}{5}s$.  Setting $\\frac{12}{5}s=36$ inches, we find $s=15$ inches.
