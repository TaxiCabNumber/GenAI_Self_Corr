        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA school is arranging chairs in rows for an assembly. $11$ chairs make a complete row, and right now there are $110$ chairs total. The school wants to have as few empty seats as possible, but all rows of chairs must be complete. If $70$ students will attend the assembly, how many chairs should be removed?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of rows: 110 chairs / 11 chairs/row = 10 rows.\n\n2. Calculate the number of chairs needed for 70 students: 70 students * 1 chair/student = 70 chairs.\n\n3. Calculate the number of chairs to remove: 10 rows * 11 chairs/row - 70 chairs = 110 chairs - 70 chairs = 40 chairs.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The original number of chairs is divisible by $11$, and the final number of remaining chairs must also be divisible by $11$ to have complete rows. This means that the number of chairs removed must be divisible by $11$ because the difference between two multiples of $b$ is also a multiple of $b$. In other words, $$b \\cdot m - b \\cdot n = b \\cdot k.$$ The smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $70$ is $77$, so we want $77$ chairs to remain. This means we must take away \\begin{align*}\n110 - 77 &= 11 \\cdot 10 - 11 \\cdot 7 \\\\\n&= 11(10-7) \\\\\n&= 11 \\cdot 3 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{33}\n\\end{align*} chairs. We check that $33$ is divisible by $11$, and it is, so we took away $3$ complete rows of chairs."
