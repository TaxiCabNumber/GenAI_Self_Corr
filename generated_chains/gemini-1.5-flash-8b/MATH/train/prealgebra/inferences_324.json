At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
        "inference": "There are 5 couples, so there are 10 people.\nEach person shakes hands with everyone else except their spouse.\nThe total number of possible handshakes between 10 people is $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$.\nEach couple does not shake hands with each other, so there are 5 couples * 2 people/couple = 10 handshakes that are not made.\nThe number of handshakes exchanged is the total possible handshakes minus the handshakes that were not made.\n$45 - 5 = 40$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
