At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn athlete's heart beats an average of 150 times per minute while running. How many times does the athlete's heart beat during a 26-mile race if the athlete runs at a pace of 5 minutes per mile?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total time of the race: 26 miles * 5 minutes/mile = 130 minutes.\n2. Calculate the total heartbeats: 130 minutes * 150 beats/minute = 19500 beats.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19500}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
