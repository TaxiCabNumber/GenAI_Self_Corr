At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDuring the first year, ABC's stock price starts at $ \\$100 $ and increases $ 100\\% $. During the second year, its stock price goes down $ 25\\% $ from its price at the end of the first year. What is the price of the stock, in dollars, at the end of the second year?",

This means the price increases by $ 100\\% $ of $ \\$100 $, which is $ 100\\% \\times \\$100 = \\$100 $.\n3. The price at the end of the first year is $ \\$100 + \\$100 = \\$200 $.\n4. During the second year, the stock price goes down by $ 25\\% $ from the price at the end of the first year, which is $ \\$200 $.\n5. The decrease in price is $ 25\\% \\times \\$200 = \\$50 $.\n6.
