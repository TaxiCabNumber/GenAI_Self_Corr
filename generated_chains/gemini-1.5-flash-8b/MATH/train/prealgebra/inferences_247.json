        "inference": "The figure is composed of squares with side length 1.  The figure has a total of 12 squares.  Each square has a perimeter of 4.  The total perimeter of the figure is 4 x 12 = 48.\nHowever, the sides of the squares that are inside the figure are not part of the outer perimeter.  Looking at the figure, we see that the vertical and horizontal edges of the squares are shared. The outer perimeter is formed by the total length of the outside edges.  On the left side, there are 4 edges, on the right side, there are 4 edges, on the top there are 4 edges.\nOn the bottom there are 4 edges.  However, the middle edges are counted twice.  So, the horizontal edges form 4 + 3 * 2 = 10.  The vertical edges form 4 + 3 * 2 = 10.  Thus, there are 20 edges forming the outside perimeter.  Each side is of length 1, so the perimeter is 20.  A better way to see it is that we have 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16. However, we have parts counted more than once.\nFrom the top there are 4 edges, from the bottom, 4, from the left, 4, from the right, 4.  We need to subtract 2 for each of the overlaps on the sides.\nThe perimeter consists of 4 units along the top, 4 along the bottom, 4 along the left, 4 along the right.\nThere are 2 squares that overlap vertically.\nThere are 2 squares that overlap horizontally.\nSo, we have 16 - 4 = 12.  The sides overlap, so we have 4 + 2 = 6.\nThere are 4 squares on the top.  They have 4+3+2 + 2= 11.\nThere are 4 vertical and 4 horizontal.  The outside perimeter has 4+4+4+4= 16.  Looking at the horizontal edges, there are 4 outer, and 2 overlaps, so there are 2+2+2+2=8.  Same for vertical.  There are 4+3 = 7 horizontal edges.\nThere are 16 edges in total (including the ones that are counted twice).\nEach square has a perimeter of 4.  There are 10 squares.  The perimeter would be 10 * 4 = 40.\nThere are 12 squares in total.\nThe top side is 4 units long. The bottom side is 4 units long. The left side is 4 units long. The right side is 4 units long.\nThe vertical edges are 4, 2, 2.  4+4+4+4-2-2=12.\nCount the units that form the outside edges. There are 12 full units on the top and bottom.  There are 8 units on the left and right.  So 12+8=20.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$",
        "ground_truth": "There are 16 horizontal segments on the perimeter.  Each has length 1, so the horizontal segments contribute 16 to the perimeter.\n\nThere are 10 vertical segments on the perimeter.  Each has length 1, so the vertical segments contribute 10 to the perimeter.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is $10+16=\\boxed{26}$.\n\n(We could arrive at this total instead by starting at a fixed point and travelling around the outside of the figure counting the number of segments.)"
