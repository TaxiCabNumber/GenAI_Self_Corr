At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSixty percent of a plane's passengers are women and ten percent of those women are in first class. What is the number of women in first class if the plane is carrying 200 passengers?",
