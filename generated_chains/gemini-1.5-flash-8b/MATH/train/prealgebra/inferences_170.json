        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 8 sprinters in the Olympic 100-meter finals. Three of the sprinters are Americans.  The gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.   In how many ways can the medals be awarded if at most one American gets a medal?",
        "inference": "1. Case 1: No American wins a medal.\nThere are 5 non-American sprinters. The gold medal can be awarded to any of the 5 sprinters, the silver medal to any of the remaining 4 sprinters, and the bronze medal to any of the remaining 3 sprinters.  The number of ways is 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.\n\n2. Case 2: Exactly one American wins a medal.\nThere are 3 American sprinters.\n   * If the American wins gold: There are 3 choices for the American, and 5 choices for the silver medal winner, and 4 choices for the bronze medal winner. This gives 3 * 5 * 4 = 60 ways.\n   * If the American wins silver: There are 3 choices for the American, and 5 choices for the gold medal winner, and 4 choices for the bronze medal winner. This gives 3 * 5 * 4 = 60 ways.\n   * If the American wins bronze: There are 3 choices for the American, and 5 choices for the gold medal winner, and 4 choices for the silver medal winner. This gives 3 * 5 * 4 = 60 ways.\nThe total number of ways in this case is 60 + 60 + 60 = 180.\n\n3. Adding the cases:\nThe total number of ways to award the medals with at most one American winning a medal is 60 + 180 = 240.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{240}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: No Americans get a medal. So there are 5 choices for the gold medal, 4 choices for the silver, and 3 choices for bronze, which is $5\\times4\\times3=60$ ways.\n\nCase 2: One American gets a medal. There are 3 Americans to choose from. After we choose which American to get the medal, we have to decide which medal to reward the American, for which we have 3 choices. Then we have 5 choices for one of the remaining medal and 4 choices for the last medal. So, we have a total of $3\\times3\\times5\\times4=180$ ways.\n\nSum up the two cases, and we have a total of $180+60=\\boxed{240}$ ways."
