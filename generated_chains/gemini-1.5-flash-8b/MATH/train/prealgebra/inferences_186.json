        "ground_truth": "The smallest three-digit number is $100$. When we divide 100 by 13, we get 7 with a remainder of 9. $$100=13 \\cdot 7 + 9$$Because we want the smallest three-digit multiple of $13$, $13\\cdot 7$ cannot be our answer because it is less than $100$ and is therefore a two-digit number. Instead we go up one multiple of $13$ and find that $13 \\cdot 8= \\boxed{104}$ is our smallest three-digit multiple of $13$."

The smallest three-digit number is 100.\n\n2. To find the smallest multiple of 13 that is greater than or equal to 100, we need to divide 100 by 13: $100 \\div 13 \\approx 7.6923$.\n\n3.
