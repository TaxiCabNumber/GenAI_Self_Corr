At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of measures of two complementary angles is 4 to 5. The smallest measure is increased by $10\\%$. By what percent must the larger measure be decreased so that the two angles remain complementary?",
        "inference": "Let the two complementary angles be $4x$ and $5x$.\nSince they are complementary, $4x + 5x = 90$.\nThis gives $9x = 90$, so $x = 10$.\nThe angles are $4x = 40$ and $5x = 50$.\nThe smallest measure is 40 and the larger measure is 50.\nThe smallest measure is increased by $10\\%$.\n$40 + 0.1(40) = 40 + 4 = 44$.\nLet $y$ be the percent by which the larger measure (50) must be decreased to maintain complementarity with the increased smaller angle.\nWe need $44 + 50 - 50(y/100) = 90$.\n$44 + 50 - 50(y/100) = 90$.\n$94 - 50(y/100) = 90$.\n$94 - 0.5y = 90$.\n$4 = 0.5y$.\n$y = 8$.\nSo the larger measure must be decreased by $8\\%$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$",
        "ground_truth": "If the ratio of the two complementary angles is 4 to 5, then there are 9 equal parts making up the full 90 degrees. That means each part is 10 degrees, and the two angles are 40 degrees and 50 degrees. When the 40-degree angle is increased by $10\\%$, we get 44 degrees. The 50-degree angle must drop down to 46 so that the two angles remain complementary. Dividing 46 by 50, we get 0.92, or $92\\%$. The larger angle must decrease by $\\boxed{8\\%}$."
