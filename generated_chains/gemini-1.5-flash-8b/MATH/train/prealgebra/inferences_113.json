I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty-four 4-inch wide square posts are evenly spaced with 5 feet between adjacent posts to enclose a square field, as shown. What is the outer perimeter, in feet, of the fence? Express your answer as a mixed number.

The distance between adjacent posts is 5 feet.\n\n3. The length of one side of the square formed by the posts is (6-1)*5 feet = 5*5 = 25 feet.\n\n4. The length of one side of the square field, excluding the posts, is the length between the outer posts. There are 6 posts, but 5 spaces in between.\n\n5.

        "ground_truth": "There are 20 square posts which are not on a corner, so there are $20/4=5$ square posts on each side, not including the corner posts.  Including the corner posts, there are 7 posts on a side, which means that there are 6 five-foot gaps between posts.
