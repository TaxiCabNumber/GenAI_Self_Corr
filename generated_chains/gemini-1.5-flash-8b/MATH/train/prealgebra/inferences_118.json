I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is increased by $25\\%$, but the width of the rectangle is decreased to keep the area of the rectangle  unchanged.  By what percent was the rectangle's width  decreased?",

The original area is $A = lw$.\nThe length is increased by $25\\%$, so the new length is $l' = l + 0.25l = 1.25l$.\nThe new area is $A' = l'w' = (1.25l)w' = lw$.\nSince the area remains unchanged, we have $1.25lw' = lw$.\nDividing both sides by $1.25l$, we get $w' = \\frac{lw}{1.25l} = \\frac{w}{1.25} = 0.8w$.\nThe width is decreased by $w - w' = w - 0.8w = 0.2w$.\nThe percentage decrease in the width is $\\frac{0.2w}{w} \\times 100\\% = 0.2 \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20%}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
