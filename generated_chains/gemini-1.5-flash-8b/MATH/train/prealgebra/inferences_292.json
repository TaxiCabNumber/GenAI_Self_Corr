At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA floor 9 feet by 12 feet, is to be tiled with 4-inch-by-6-inch tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the floor?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the dimensions of the floor from feet to inches:\n   9 feet * 12 inches/foot = 108 inches\n   12 feet * 12 inches/foot = 144 inches\n\n2. Calculate the area of the floor in square inches:\n   Area = 108 inches * 144 inches = 15552 square inches\n\n3. Calculate the area of one tile in square inches:\n   Area of one tile = 4 inches * 6 inches = 24 square inches\n\n4. Divide the total area of the floor by the area of one tile to find the number of tiles needed:\n   Number of tiles = 15552 square inches / 24 square inches/tile = 648 tiles\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{648}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Notice how 4 inches = 1/3 foot and 6 inches = 1/2 foot, so both the width and length will be tiled with full tiles (i.e. no tiles have to be broken).  Since all tiles remain whole, we can calculate the number of tiles by dividing the total floor area by each tile's area.  Doing so yields \\[\\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{4 \\text{ inches} \\cdot 6 \\text{ inches}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{1/3 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 1/2 \\text{ ft}} = \\boxed{648}.\\]Hence, we need $\\boxed{648}$ tiles to cover the floor."
