At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the next three days, 2000 people will move to Florida. How many people, on average, will move to Florida each hour? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
