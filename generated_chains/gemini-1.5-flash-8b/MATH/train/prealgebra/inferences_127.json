At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The length of the repeating block is 4.\nTo find the sum of the first 40 digits after the decimal point, we need to consider how many times the repeating block 0009 appears in the first 40 digits.\nSince 40 is divisible by 4, the sum of the first 40 digits is simply 10 times the sum of the repeating block 0009.\nThe repeating block is 0009. The sum of the digits in the repeating block is $0 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 9$.\nSince there are 10 repetitions of the repeating block 0009, the sum of the first 40 digits is $10 \\times 9 = 90$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$",
