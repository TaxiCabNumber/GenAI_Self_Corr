        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMegan has lost Fatima's phone number. Megan knows that the first three digits are either 296 or 299. The remaining four digits are 0, 1, 6 and 7, but she isn't sure of the order of these digits. If Megan randomly dials a seven-digit number that meets these conditions, what is the probability that she dials Fatima's correct number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 2 possible first three digits (296 or 299).\nFor each choice of first three digits, there are 4! = 24 possible orderings of the remaining four digits (0, 1, 6, 7).\nTotal possible numbers = 2 * 24 = 48\nThe probability that Megan dials Fatima's correct number is 1/48.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{48}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 2 different ways in which Megan can type the first three numbers. There are $4! = 24$ different orderings of the digits 0, 1, 6 and 7 for the last four digits. So, there are $2 \\cdot 24 = 48$ different numbers she can dial. Since exactly one number will be Fatima's, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{48}}$ probability of Megan guessing it right."
