At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose I have 6 shirts, 4 ties, and 3 pairs of pants.  If an outfit requires a shirt and pants, and can either have a tie or not have a tie, how many outfits can I make?",
        "inference": "1. Shirts: 6 choices\n2. Pants: 3 choices\n3. Ties: 4 choices (or 0 choices)\n4. Number of outfits without a tie: 6 shirts * 3 pants = 18 outfits\n5. Number of outfits with a tie: 6 shirts * 3 pants * 4 ties = 72 outfits\n6. Total outfits: 18 + 72 = 90 outfits\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 choices of shirt, 3 choices of pants, and 5 choices for either wearing one of the 4 ties or not wearing a tie at all, so the total number of outfits is $6 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{90}$."
