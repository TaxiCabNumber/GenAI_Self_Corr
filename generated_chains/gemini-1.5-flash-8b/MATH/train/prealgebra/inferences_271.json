        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of $7^3$ is $7 \\times 7 \\times 7$. Since the three integers are different positive integers, we must have three different positive integers whose product is $7^3$.  The only possible combinations of three different positive integers whose product is $7^3$ are $1 \\times 7 \\times 49$, but $1, 7, 49$ are different. \nThe integers are $1, 7, 49$.\n$1 + 7 + 49 = 57$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{57}$",
        "ground_truth": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$."
