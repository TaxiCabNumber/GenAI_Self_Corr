At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA storm in Sydney, Australia, caused $\\$$30 million in damage. That estimate was in Australian dollars. At that time, 1.5 Australian dollars were worth 1 American dollar. Determine the number of American dollars of damage the storm caused.",
        "inference": "1. Convert Australian dollars to American dollars:  $30,000,000  / 1.5 = $20,000,000\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$20,000,000}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 1.5 Australian dollars are worth 1 American dollar, 1 Australian dollar is worth $\\dfrac{1}{1.5}=\\dfrac{2}{3}$ American dollars. Therefore, the number of American dollars of damage was $$\\left( \\dfrac{2}{3} \\right) (30,\\!000,\\!000)=\\boxed{20,\\!000,\\!000}.$$"
