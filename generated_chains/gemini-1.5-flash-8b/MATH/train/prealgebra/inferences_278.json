        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $3x-5=10x+9$, what is $4(x+7)$?",
        "inference": "1. Subtract $3x$ from both sides: $-5 = 7x + 9$.\n2. Subtract $9$ from both sides: $-14 = 7x$.\n3. Divide both sides by $7$: $x = -2$.\n4. Substitute $x = -2$ into the expression $4(x+7)$: $4(-2+7) = 4(5) = 20$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $3x+9$ from both sides of the first equation gives $-14=7x$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 7 shows that $x=-2$. Substituting this value of $x$ into $4(x+7)$ gives $4(-2+7)=4(5)=\\boxed{20}$."
