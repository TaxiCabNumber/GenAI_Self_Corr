        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob is visiting Japan and he wants to buy a coffee for $200$ yen. If one U.S. dollar is worth $108$ yen, how much money, in USD to the nearest hundredth, does he have to spend for the coffee? (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
        "inference": "1. Convert yen to USD:\n   Divide the cost of the coffee (200 yen) by the exchange rate (108 yen/USD).\n   200 yen / 108 yen/USD = 1.85185... USD\n\n2. Round to the nearest hundredth:\n   1.85185... rounds to 1.85 USD\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$1.85}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Bob must pay $200$ yen, which we can multiply by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}}$ to obtain the value in U.S. dollars. Carrying out the calculation, we find that Bob must use $200\\ \\text{yen} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}} \\approx \\boxed{1.85\\ \\text{USD}}$ for the coffee."
