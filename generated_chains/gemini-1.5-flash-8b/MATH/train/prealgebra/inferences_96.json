At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same?",
        "inference": "Each coin can either be heads or tails.  There are 2 possible outcomes for each coin (H or T).  Since there are 4 coins, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible outcomes in total.\n\nWe want the penny and dime to be the same.  This means they are both heads or both tails.  For each of these two possibilities, there are two outcomes for the nickel and two outcomes for the quarter. This gives us $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^3 = 8$ outcomes.\nThe probability of the penny and dime being the same is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails).  There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails.  There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter.  So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{8}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
