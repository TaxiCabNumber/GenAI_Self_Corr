        "inference": "The problem states the area of a square is 325.  The area of a square is side length squared, so side\u00b2 = 325.  Taking the square root of both sides gives side = \u221a325.  Simplifying the radical, side = \u221a(25 * 13) = 5\u221a13.  The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so perimeter = 4 * 5\u221a13 = 20\u221a13.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{13}}$",
