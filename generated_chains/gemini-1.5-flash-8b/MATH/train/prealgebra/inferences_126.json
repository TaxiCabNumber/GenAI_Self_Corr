At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn is thinking of a number. He gives the following 3 clues. ``My number has 125 as a factor. My number is a multiple of 30. My number is between 800 and 2000.'' What is John's number?",
        "inference": "1. My number has 125 as a factor. This means the number is a multiple of 125.\n2. My number is a multiple of 30. This means the number is a multiple of 2 * 3 * 5.\n3. My number is between 800 and 2000.\n\nCombining clues 1 and 2, the number must be a multiple of both 125 and 30.  To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 125 and 30, we find the prime factorization of each:\n125 = 5^3\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n\nThe LCM is 2 * 3 * 5^3 = 2 * 3 * 125 = 750.\nSo, the multiples of 750 are potential solutions.\n\nThe multiples of 750 between 800 and 2000 are:\n750 * 2 = 1500\n750 * 3 = 2250, which is greater than 2000.\n\nThe only multiple of 750 between 800 and 2000 is 1500.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1500}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be John's number. $n$ is a multiple of $125=5^3$ and of $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$, so the prime factorization of $n$ must contain 5 raised to at least the 3rd power, 2 raised to at least the 1st power, and 3 raised to at least the 1st power. Thus, $\\text{LCM}(125, 30)=2\\cdot3\\cdot5^3= 750$. $n$ is then some multiple of 750. Since $n$ is between 800 and 2000, $n=750$ is too small. Thus, we try $n=2 \\cdot 750=1500$. This number could be John's number. Notice that $n=3 \\cdot 750=2250$ is too large. Thus, John's number is $\\boxed{1500}$."
