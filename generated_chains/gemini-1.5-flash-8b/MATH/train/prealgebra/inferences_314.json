At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nApartment rentals in Fairview run $\\$$0.90 per square foot. Jillian has determined that she can afford $\\$$630 per month for rent. What is the largest apartment, in square feet, she should consider at the given rate?",
        "inference": "To find the largest apartment size Jillian can afford, divide the total amount she can afford by the cost per square foot.  \n$630 / 0.90 = 700$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{700}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the size of the apartment be $s$.  The cost will be $0.9s$.  The maximum comes when this is $630$, so\n\n$$630=0.9s\\Rightarrow s=\\boxed{700}$$\n\nsquare feet."
