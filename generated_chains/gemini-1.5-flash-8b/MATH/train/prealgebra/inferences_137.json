        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have three distinct mystery novels, three distinct fantasy novels, and three distinct biographies. I'm going on vacation, and I want to take two books of different genres. How many possible pairs can I choose?",
        "inference": "1. Choose 1 mystery novel out of 3: 3 ways\n2. Choose 1 fantasy novel out of 3: 3 ways\n3. Choose 1 biography out of 3: 3 ways\n\nPairs of mystery and fantasy: 3 * 3 = 9\nPairs of mystery and biography: 3 * 3 = 9\nPairs of fantasy and biography: 3 * 3 = 9\n\nTotal pairs = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "I can choose one book in $9$ ways. Then, for the second book, I have $6$ choices that aren't in the same genre as the first book. It would seem that I have $9\\cdot 6$ choices for the two books; however, this overcounts pairs by a factor of $2$, since each pair has been counted in two ways (once in either order). So, the actual number of pairs is $(9\\cdot 6)/2$, which is $\\boxed{27}$.\n\nAlternative solution: Of the three genres of book, one must be excluded. We can choose the genre to be excluded in $3$ ways. Then, of the two remaining genres, we can choose a book of the first genre in $3$ ways, and we can choose a book of the second genre in $3$ ways. This gives us $3\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{27}$ possible sets of choices (all of which produce different pairs of books, with no overcounting)."
