        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
