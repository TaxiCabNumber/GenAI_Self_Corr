At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AB=BC$. Point $D$ is the midpoint of both $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AE}$, and $\\overline{CE}$ is 11 units long. What is the length of $\\overline{BD}$?

The figure is not to scale, and we cannot determine lengths from visual representation alone.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5.5}$",
        "ground_truth": "Because triangles $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AE}$, $ABEC$ must be a parallelogram, so $AB=CE=11$. Then because triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, $BC=AB=11$. That means $BD=\n\\frac{11}{2}$ or $\\boxed{5.5}$."
