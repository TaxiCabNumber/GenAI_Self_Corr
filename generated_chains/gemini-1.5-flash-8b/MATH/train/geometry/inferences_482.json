I hope it is correct.'\nA solid in the shape of a right circular cone is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire surface of the cone, including its base, is painted. A plane parallel to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid $C$ and a frustum-shaped solid $F,$ in such a way that the ratio between the areas of the painted surfaces of $C$ and $F$ and the ratio between the volumes of $C$ and $F$ are both equal to $k$. Given that $k=\\frac m n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\n",

Let $A_c$ and $A_f$ denote the area of the painted surface on cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively, and let $V_c$ and $V_f$ denote the volume of cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively.
