The height of the trapezoid is the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the top and bottom bases, which is 4-y.

Then $24 - 4y = 40$.\n$-4y = 16$. Then $y = -4$.\nThis is wrong. The height of the trapezoid BCDE is the $y$-coordinate of C.\nThe area of trapezoid BCDE is  $\\frac{1}{2} (4+4)(|4-y|) = 4 |4-y|$.
