At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?",
        "inference": "Let the side lengths be $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $a < b < c$.\nThe triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.  This gives us $a+b > c$, $a+c > b$, and $b+c > a$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, $a+b > c$, which implies $c < a+b$.\nThe perimeter is $a+b+c = 20$.\nWe want to maximize $c$.  From the triangle inequality, $a+b > c$, and $a+b+c = 20$, so $20 - c > c$, which means $2c < 20$, so $c < 10$.\nThe largest possible value for $c$ is 9.  If $c=9$, then $a+b = 20-9 = 11$.\nThe smallest possible integer values for $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b$ are $a=1$ and $b=10$.  However, $1+10 = 11 > 9$, so $1, 10, 9$ satisfy the triangle inequality.\nThus, the maximum length of any one side is 9.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$."
