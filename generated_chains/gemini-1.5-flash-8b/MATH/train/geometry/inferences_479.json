At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical log has diameter $12$ inches. A wedge is cut from the log by making two planar cuts that go entirely through the log. The first is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and the plane of the second cut forms a $45^\\circ$ angle with the plane of the first cut. The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log. The number of cubic inches in the wedge can be expressed as $n\\pi$, where n is a positive integer. Find $n$.\n",
        "inference": "The volume of the wedge is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (\\text{area of base}) \\cdot (\\text{height})$. The base is a triangle formed by the intersection of the two planes. The diameter of the log is 12 inches, so the radius is 6 inches. The first cut is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. The second cut forms a 45-degree angle with the first cut. The intersection of these two cuts is a line that goes through the log. The wedge has a base that is a triangle. The area of the base is $\\frac{1}{2} (6 \\times 6) \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 9\\sqrt{2}$. The height of the wedge is the length of the log, which is $12 \\pi$.\nThe volume of the wedge is then $\\frac{1}{2} (9\\sqrt{2}) (12\\pi) = 54\\sqrt{2}\\pi$.\nSince the problem states that the intersection of the two planes has exactly one point in common with the log, the wedge will be a right triangular prism. The two cuts are perpendicular to each other. The area of the base of the prism is a triangle with two legs of length 6. The area of the base is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(6) = 18$. The height of the prism is the length of the cylinder, which is $12 \\pi$.\nThe volume of the wedge is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{area of base}) \\times (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 \\times 12\\pi = 108\\pi$.\nThe base is a triangle with legs of length 6 inches each. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6) \\sin(45^\\circ) = 18 \\sin(45^\\circ) = 18(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 9\\sqrt{2}$.  The height of the wedge is the length of the cylinder, which is $12\\pi$. Thus, the volume of the wedge is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (9\\sqrt{2}) \\times (12\\pi) = 54\\sqrt{2}\\pi$.\n\nWe need the volume of the wedge, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\text{Area of Base} \\times \\text{Height}$.\nThe base is a triangle with sides 6 inches each, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(6) = 18$. The height is the length of the cylinder, which is $12\\pi$.\nVolume = $\\frac{1}{2} (18) (12 \\pi) = 108\\pi$.\n$n = 108$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{108}$",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of the wedge is half the volume of a cylinder with height $12$ and radius $6$. (Imagine taking another identical wedge and sticking it to the existing one). Thus, $V=\\dfrac{6^2\\cdot 12\\pi}{2}=216\\pi$, so $n=\\boxed{216}$."
