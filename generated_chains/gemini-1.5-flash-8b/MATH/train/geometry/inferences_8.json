At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
