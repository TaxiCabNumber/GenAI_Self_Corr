The distance from the center of the base to each vertex of the base is the length of a diagonal of a square with side length 10 cm, which is $10\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n4. The slant height of each triangular face is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 12 cm (height) and 5 cm (half the side length of the base). The slant height is $\\sqrt{12^2+5^2} = \\sqrt{144+25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13$ cm.\n5. Each triangular face has three edges: one is the base edge of length 10 cm, and the other two are the slant edges of length 13 cm. Thus, the sum of the lengths of the edges of one triangular face is $10+13+13 = 36$ cm.\n6. The pyramid has 4 triangular faces, so the total length of the edges of the 4 faces is $4 \\times 36 = 144$ cm.\n7. The total length of the edges of the pyramid is 144 cm + 4 * 10 cm (from the base edges) = 144 cm + 40 cm = 184 cm.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{184}$",

The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$"
