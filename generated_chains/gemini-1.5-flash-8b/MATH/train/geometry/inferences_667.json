The minimum value of $|k - 10|$ occurs when $k = 10$.\nThe area is $6 |k - 10|$. The minimum value is when $k = 10$, so the area is $6 |10 - 10| = 0$, which is impossible.\nHowever, if $k = 10$, the three points are collinear.\nThus, the area is minimized when $k = 10$.\nThen we need to find the values of $k$ such that the area is minimized. Since $k$ is an integer, the expression $6 |k - 10|$ is minimized when $|k - 10|$ is minimized. The possible values for $k$ are integers around 10.\nThe values of $k$ for which the area of the triangle is a minimum are integers that make $|k - 10|$ as small as possible, which are $k=9$ and $k=11$.\nIn this case, the minimum area occurs when $k = 9$ or $k = 11$.\nThe area is $6 |k - 10|$. The possible values of $|k - 10|$ are 1 for $k = 9$ or $k = 11$.\nThen the areas are $6 \\cdot 1 = 6$. Thus the minimum area is 6 when $k = 9$ or $k = 11$.\nSo the values of $k$ for which the area is minimized are $k=9$ and $k=11$. The sum of these values is $9 + 11 = 20$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by finding the equation of the line $\\ell$ containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$. The slope of $\\ell$ is $\\frac{16-7}{13-1} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac 34$, so the line has the point-slope form $y - 7 = \\frac 34 (x - 1)$. Substituting the value $x = 5$, we obtain that $y = 7 + \\frac 34 (5-1) = 10$. It follows that the point $(5,10)$ lies on the line containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$ (for $k = 10$, we obtain a degenerate triangle). To minimize the area of the triangle, it follows that $k$ must either be equal to $9$ or $11$.\n\nIndeed, we claim that both such triangles have the same area. Dropping the perpendiculars from $(5,9)$ and $(5,11)$ to $\\ell$, we see that the perpendiculars, $\\ell$, and the line segment connecting $(5,9)$ to $(5,11)$ form two right triangles. By vertical angles, they are similar, and since they both have a hypotenuse of length $1$, they must be congruent. Then, the height of both triangles must be the same, so both $k = 9$ and $k = 11$ yield triangles with minimal area. The answer is $9 + 11 = \\boxed{20}$."
