        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the volume of the first jar.\n   The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.  The diameter is 3 inches, so the radius is 1.5 inches.\n   V\u2081 = \u03c0(1.5\u00b2) * 4 = 9\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\n2. Calculate the volume of the second jar.\n   The diameter is 6 inches, so the radius is 3 inches.\n   V\u2082 = \u03c0(3\u00b2) * 6 = 54\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\n3. Find the ratio of the volumes.\n   Ratio = V\u2082 / V\u2081 = (54\u03c0) / (9\u03c0) = 6.\n\n4. Determine the price of the second jar.\n   Since the volume of the second jar is 6 times the volume of the first, the price should also be 6 times the price of the first.\n   Price\u2082 = Price\u2081 * 6 = $0.60 * 6 = $3.60\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$3.60}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$."
