        "inference": "The volume of a sphere with radius 9 inches is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Substituting $r=9$, we get $V_1 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (9^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (729) = 972\\pi$.\nThe volume of a sphere with twice the volume of this sphere is $2 \\times 972\\pi = 1944\\pi$.\nLet the radius of this larger sphere be $r_2$.
