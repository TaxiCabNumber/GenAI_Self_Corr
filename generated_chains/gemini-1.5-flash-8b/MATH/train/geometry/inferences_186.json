        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the longest sides is $\\frac{25}{10} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nSince the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is the same.\nThe perimeter of the smaller triangle is $8+8+10=26$.\nThe perimeter of the larger triangle is $26 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 13 \\times 5 = 65$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{65}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$."
