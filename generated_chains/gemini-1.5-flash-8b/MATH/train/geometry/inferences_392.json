The problem states that the chords are tangent to the small circle, and the angle formed by two tangents from a point outside the circle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.\nThe angle between two tangents from a point outside the circle is given as $75^\\circ$.

The problem states that $m\\angle ABC = 75^\\circ$.\nHowever, this angle $75^\\circ$ is the angle between the *tangents*, not the angle formed by the chords.
