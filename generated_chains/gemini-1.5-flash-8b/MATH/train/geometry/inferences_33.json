At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular prism be $l$, $w$, and $h$. The areas of the three faces are $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$.  We want to find the volume $V = lwh$.\n\nMultiply the three equations:\n$(lw)(wh)(lh) = (6)(8)(12)$\n$(lwh)^2 = 576$\n$lwh = \\sqrt{576}$\n$lwh = 24$\n\nSo the volume of the prism is 24 cubic inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches."

We want to find the volume $V = lwh$.\nMultiplying the three equations, we get\n$$(lw)(wh)(lh) = (6)(8)(12)$$\n$$(lwh)^2 = 576$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n$$lwh = \\pm \\sqrt{576}$$\n$$lwh = \\pm 24$$\nSince the dimensions $l$, $w$, and $h$ are lengths, they must be positive.
