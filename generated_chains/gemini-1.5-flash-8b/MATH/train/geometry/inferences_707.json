        "ground_truth": "The area of the visible shaded region is equal to the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles. The diameter of the four smaller circles is equal to a side of a small square, or 2 cm, so the radius of each of the smaller circles is 1 cm. The area of all four circles is then $4\\cdot\\pi \\cdot1^2=4\\pi$. The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, or 6 cm, so the radius of the large circle is 3 cm. The area of the large circle is then $\\pi\\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi$. Each side of the grid measures $5\\cdot2=10$ cm, so the area of the grid is $10\\cdot10=100$. The area of the visible shaded region is thus $100-4\\pi-9\\pi=100-13\\pi$ square cm. So $A=100$, $B=13$, and $A+B=100+13=\\boxed{113}$."

        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear about the arrangement of the circles.  Assuming the circles are arranged in the grid, and the radius of the first four circles is 0.5 cm, and the radius of the fifth circle is 1.5 cm, and the grid is 5 by 5 cm.\n\nThe area of the grid is $5 \\times 5 = 25$ square cm. The problem states it is $5 \\times 5 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 100$ square cm. This is likely a typo, assuming that the grid is just 5 by 5.  The area of the unshaded circles is not the total area of the grid, but the area of the circles, which will be $4 \\times \\pi (0.5)^2 + \\pi (1.5)^2 = \\pi + 2.25 \\pi = 3.25 \\pi$.\nThe shaded area is the area of the 5x5 square minus the area of the circles.
