At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?",
        "inference": "Volume of the large pyramid = (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (12^2) * 8 = (1/3) * 144 * 8 = 384 cubic cm\n\nVolume of the small pyramid = (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (6^2) * 4 = (1/3) * 36 * 4 = 48 cubic cm\n\nVolume of the frustum = Volume of the large pyramid - Volume of the small pyramid = 384 - 48 = 336 cubic cm\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{336}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]"
