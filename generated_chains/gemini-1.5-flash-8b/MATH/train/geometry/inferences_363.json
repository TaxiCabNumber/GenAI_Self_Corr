        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bowling ball is a solid ball with a spherical surface and diameter 30 cm. To custom fit a bowling ball for each bowler, three holes are drilled in the ball. Bowler Kris has holes drilled that are 8 cm deep and have diameters of 2 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. Assuming the three holes are right circular cylinders, find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the fitted bowling ball. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. Volume of the bowling ball:\n   The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.  The diameter is 30 cm, so the radius is 15 cm.\n   Volume of the bowling ball = (4/3)\u03c0(15 cm)\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(3375 cm\u00b3) = 4500\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\n2. Volume of the first hole (2 cm diameter):\n   Radius = 1 cm. Depth = 8 cm.\n   Volume = \u03c0(1 cm)\u00b2(8 cm) = 8\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\n3. Volume of the second hole (2 cm diameter):\n   Radius = 1 cm. Depth = 8 cm.\n   Volume = \u03c0(1 cm)\u00b2(8 cm) = 8\u03c0 cm\u00b3\n\n4. Volume of the third hole (3 cm diameter):\n   Radius = 1.5 cm.
