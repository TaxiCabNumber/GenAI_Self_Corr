At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The slant height of the cone is 13 cm and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm.  Let the radius of the base be $r$.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $r^2 + 12^2 = 13^2$.  This gives us $r^2 + 144 = 169$, so $r^2 = 25$, and $r = 5$ cm.\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cone.  In this case, $r = 5$ cm and $h = 12$ cm.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cone is $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5^2)(12) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (25)(12) = 100\\pi$ cubic cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$."
