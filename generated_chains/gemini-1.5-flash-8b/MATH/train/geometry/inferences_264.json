        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the right rectangular prism be length (l), width (w), and height (h).\nThe area of the side face is lw = 15 square inches.\nThe area of the front face is wh = 10 square inches.\nThe area of the bottom face is lh = 6 square inches.\n\nWe want to find the volume, which is lwh.\nMultiply the three equations:\n(lw)(wh)(lh) = (15)(10)(6)\n(lwh)^2 = 900\nlwh = \u221a900\nlwh = 30\n\nThe volume of the right rectangular prism is 30 cubic inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches."
