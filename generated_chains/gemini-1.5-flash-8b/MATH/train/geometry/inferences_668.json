        "inference": "1. The line through $O$ and $B$ has a slope of $-2$. Since it passes through $(0,0)$ and $(x,0)$, the equation of the line is $y = -2x$. Since $B$ is on the positive $y$-axis, the $x$-coordinate is 0. Thus the $y$-coordinate of $B$ is 12. Point $B = (0,12)$.  Point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis, so its $y$-coordinate is 0. Using the equation $y = -2x$, we set $y=0$ to find the $x$-coordinate of $A$, which is 6.  Thus $A = (6,0)$.\n\n2. The line through $C$ and $D$ passes through $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$. Using the points $(8,0)$ and $(0,8)$, the equation of the line is  $y = -x + 8$.\n\n3. Point $E(4,4)$ is the intersection of the two lines. We can confirm this point is on both lines by substituting $x=4$ and $y=4$ into the equations.\nLine 1: $4 = -2(4) \\implies 4 = -8$, which is false.\nLine 2: $4 = -4+8 \\implies 4=4$, which is true.\nThus, E is on the line with equation $y = -x + 8$. However, we used the wrong equation for the first line, which is $y = -2x + 12$. Substituting x=4, y = -8+12=4.\n\n4.
