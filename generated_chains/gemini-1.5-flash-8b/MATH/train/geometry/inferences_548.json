The given side lengths of the tetrahedron are $AD = BC = 28$, $AC = BD = 44$, and $AB = CD = 52$.

Finding the centroid requires more information than just the side lengths. Without the necessary information or geometry, the problem is not solvable.\n\nTo solve this problem, additional details, like a diagram or a coordinate system, are needed,  or it must be a special case where some additional information about the relationship between the sides of the tetrahedron allow a solution for the shortest sum of distances.\n\nWithout the necessary geometry, the final answer cannot be determined.
