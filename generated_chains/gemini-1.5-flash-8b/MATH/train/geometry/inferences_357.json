        "inference": "The question is about a reflection.  Let A = (0,3) and C = (9,0).  The perpendicular bisector of AC is the line of reflection.  The midpoint of AC is (4.5, 1.5). The slope of AC is -1/3, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is 3.  The equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - 1.5 = 3(x - 4.5), which simplifies to y = 3x - 10.5.  Since B is (0,0), its reflection is F.  F must have the same y-coordinate as A, i.e., F = (x,3).  Since F lies on the perpendicular bisector, its coordinates satisfy y = 3x - 10.5.  Substituting y=3, we get 3 = 3x - 10.5, which gives 3x = 13.5, and x = 4.5.  Thus F = (4.5, 3). The reflection of D = (9,3) is E.  E must have the same y-coordinate as D, i.e., E = (x,0).  Since E lies on the perpendicular bisector, its coordinates satisfy y = 3x - 10.5. Substituting y=0, we get 0 = 3x - 10.5, which gives 3x = 10.5, and x = 3.5.  Thus E = (3.5, 0).  EF is the segment between the reflections of points B and D.  The distance EF is $\\sqrt{(4.5 - 3.5)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} = \\sqrt{10}$.\n\n$\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$\n",
