At the same time Allie leaves $A$, Billie leaves $B$ at a speed of $7$ meters per second and follows the straight path that produces the earliest possible meeting of the two skaters, given their speeds. How many meters does Allie skate before meeting Billie?\n[asy] pointpen=black; pathpen=black+linewidth(0.7);  pair A=(0,0),B=(10,0),C=6*expi(pi/3); D(B--A); D(A--C,EndArrow); MP(\"A\",A,SW);MP(\"B\",B,SE);MP(\"60^{\\circ}\",A+(0.3,0),NE);MP(\"100\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]\n",
