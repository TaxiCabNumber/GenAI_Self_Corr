At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circle has a radius of three inches. The distance from the center of the circle to chord $CD$ is two inches. How many inches long is chord $CD$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The distance from the center of the circle to the chord is the length of the perpendicular segment from the center to the chord.  This segment is perpendicular to the chord and bisects the chord.  Let the length of the chord be $x$.  Then each segment of the chord has length $x/2$.  We have a right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the distance from the center to the chord.  The radius is 3 inches, and the distance from the center to the chord is 2 inches.  Thus, we have a right triangle with legs of length $x/2$ and 2 inches, and a hypotenuse of length 3 inches.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem,\n$$ \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^2 + 2^2 = 3^2$$\n$$ \\frac{x^2}{4} + 4 = 9$$\n$$ \\frac{x^2}{4} = 5$$\n$$ x^2 = 20$$\n$$ x = \\sqrt{20}$$\n$$ x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 5}$$\n$$ x = 2 \\sqrt{5}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2 \\sqrt{5}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the center of the circle O, and call the point where the radius of the circle bisects the chord E.  Thus, the line segment from the center of the circle to point E has length 2, and we have $\\triangle ODE$ with a leg of 2 and a hypotenuse of 3.  Thus, the other leg, DE has length $\\sqrt{5}$, and since DE is $\\frac{CD}{2}$, we have $CD = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$."
