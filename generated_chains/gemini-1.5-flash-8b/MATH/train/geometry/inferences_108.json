I hope it is correct.'\nA telephone pole is supported by a steel cable which extends from the top of the pole to a point on the ground 3 meters from its base. When Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole toward the point where the cable is attached to the ground, her head just touches the cable. Leah is 1.5 meters tall. How many meters tall is the pole?",
        "inference": "Let the height of the telephone pole be h meters.\nThe cable forms a right triangle with the pole and the ground.\nThe distance from the base of the pole to the point where the cable touches the ground is 3 meters.\nThe distance from the base of the pole to the point where Leah is standing is 2.5 meters.\nLeah's height is 1.5 meters.\nThe triangle formed by the pole, cable, and ground is similar to the triangle formed by Leah, the cable, and the ground.\nThe ratio of the height of the pole to the distance from the base of the pole to the point where the cable touches the ground is equal to the ratio of Leah's height to the distance from the base of the pole to where Leah is standing.\nh / 3 = 1.5 / (3 - 2.5)\nh / 3 = 1.5 / 0.5\nh / 3 = 3\nh = 3 * 3\nh = 9\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$\n",
