        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal.\nThe ratio of the first leg to the second leg is $\\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nThe ratio of the corresponding legs in the second triangle is $\\frac{x}{5}$.\nWe have $\\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n$x = \\frac{5 \\times 5}{4} = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.25}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$."
