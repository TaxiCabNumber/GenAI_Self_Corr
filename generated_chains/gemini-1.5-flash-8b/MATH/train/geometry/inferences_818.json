At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?",
        "inference": "1. Find the base of the triangle. The base is the length of segment AB.  Using the distance formula, $AB = \\sqrt{(6-1)^2 + (1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{5^2 + 0^2} = 5$.\n\n2. Find the height of the triangle. The height is the perpendicular distance from vertex C to the line containing segment AB. Since AB is horizontal, the height is the vertical distance from C to AB. This is $|7-1| = 6$.\n\n3. Calculate the area. The area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 6 = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$."
