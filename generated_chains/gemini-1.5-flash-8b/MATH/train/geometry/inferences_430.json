I hope it is correct.'\nA fenced, rectangular field measures $24$ meters by $52$ meters. An agricultural researcher has 1994 meters of fence that can be used for internal fencing to partition the field into congruent, square test plots. The entire field must be partitioned, and the sides of the squares must be parallel to the edges of the field. What is the largest number of square test plots into which the field can be partitioned using all or some of the 1994 meters of fence?\n",

        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular field be $24$ m by $52$ m. The area is $24 \\times 52 = 1248$ m$^2$. Let the side length of each square be $s$ m. The side length must divide both 24 and 52. The greatest common divisor of 24 and 52 is $\\text{gcd}(24, 52) = 4$. So possible values for $s$ are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nIf $s=1$, the number of squares is $\\frac{24 \\times 52}{1^2} = 1248$.

The greatest common divisor is 4.  When $s=4$, the number of squares is $\\frac{24}{4} \\times \\frac{52}{4} = 6 \\times 13 = 78$.  The perimeter of these 78 squares is $4 \\times 78 = 312$ m.  The fence available is 1994 m.  Since we can use the entire 1994 meters for a total perimeter, we can fit 78 squares inside the field.  If we use more than 78 squares, the perimeter of those squares would be greater than 1994 m.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$",
