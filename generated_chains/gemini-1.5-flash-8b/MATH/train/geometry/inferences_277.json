At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCircle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?",
        "inference": "1. Reflecting the center $T(-2,6)$ across the $y$-axis changes the sign of the $x$-coordinate. The reflection is $T'(2,6)$.\n\n2. Translating the reflected point $T'(2,6)$ 8 units down means subtracting 8 from the $y$-coordinate. The translation is $T''(2,6-8) = T''(2,-2)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(2,-2)}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$."
