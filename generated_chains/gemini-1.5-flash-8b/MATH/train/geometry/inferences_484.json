At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA convex polyhedron $P$ has $26$ vertices, $60$ edges, and $36$ faces, $24$ of which are triangular and $12$ of which are quadrilaterals. A space diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices that do not belong to the same face. How many space diagonals does $P$ have?\n",
        "inference": "The total number of vertices is 26. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices is $\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325$.\nThe number of edges is 60, so the number of pairs of vertices that are connected by an edge is 60.\nThe number of space diagonals is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices minus the number of edges minus the number of ways to choose 2 vertices that are adjacent to a common face.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the 26 vertices is $\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325$.\nThe number of edges is 60.\nThe number of triangular faces is 24. Each triangle has 3 edges, so the number of pairs of vertices that are adjacent to a common face in a triangle is $24 \\times 3 = 72$. Since we double count, we need to divide by 2, so there are 36 pairs of vertices that are adjacent to a common triangle.\nThe number of quadrilateral faces is 12. Each quadrilateral has 4 edges, so the number of pairs of vertices that are adjacent to a common face in a quadrilateral is $12 \\times 4 = 48$.  Since we double count, we need to divide by 2, so there are 24 pairs of vertices that are adjacent to a common quadrilateral.\nTotal pairs of vertices adjacent to a common face are 36 + 24 = 60.\nNumber of space diagonals = Total pairs of vertices - edges - pairs of vertices adjacent to a common face\nNumber of space diagonals = 325 - 60 - (36 + 24) = 325 - 60 - 60 = 205.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{205}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Every pair of vertices of the polyhedron determines either an edge, a face diagonal or a space diagonal. We have ${26 \\choose 2} = \\frac{26\\cdot25}2 = 325$ total line segments determined by the vertices. Of these, $60$ are edges. Each triangular face has $0$ face diagonals and each quadrilateral face has $2$, so there are $2 \\cdot 12 = 24$ face diagonals. This leaves $325 - 60 - 24 = \\boxed{241}$ segments to be the space diagonals."
