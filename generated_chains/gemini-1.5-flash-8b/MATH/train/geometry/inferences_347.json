        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula $2\\pi rh$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.  In this case, $r = 2$ inches and $h = 5$ inches.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $2\\pi(2)(5) = 20\\pi$ square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$."
