Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the total surface area of the pyramid, in square centimeters?",
        "inference": "1. Find the area of the square base:  Area = side\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 = 100 cm\u00b2\n\n2. Find the slant height of each triangular face.  The slant height (s) forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with half the base side length (5 cm) as one leg and the height of the pyramid (12 cm) as the other leg.  Using the Pythagorean theorem:  s\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = 25 + 144 = 169.  So, s = \u221a169 = 13 cm.\n\n3. Find the area of one triangular face: Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 10 * 13 = 65 cm\u00b2\n\n4. Find the total area of the four triangular faces: Total area = 4 * 65 cm\u00b2 = 260 cm\u00b2\n\n5. Add the area of the square base to the total area of the triangular faces: Total surface area = 100 cm\u00b2 + 260 cm\u00b2 = 360 cm\u00b2\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360}$ cm\u00b2. I hope it is correct.\n",
