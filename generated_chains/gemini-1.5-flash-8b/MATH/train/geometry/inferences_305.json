        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA dump truck delivered sand to a construction site. The sand formed a conical pile with a diameter of $8$ feet and a height that was $75\\%$ of the diameter. How many cubic feet of sand were in the pile? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The diameter of the conical pile is 8 feet.  The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius is 4 feet.\nThe height is 75% of the diameter, which is $0.75 \\times 8 = 6$ feet.\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\nIn this case, $r = 4$ feet and $h = 6$ feet.\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n$V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (4^2)(6) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (16)(6) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi (96) = 32\\pi$ cubic feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The height of the cone is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6$. The radius of the cone is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{4^2 \\times 6 \\times \\pi}{3} = \\boxed{32 \\pi}$."
