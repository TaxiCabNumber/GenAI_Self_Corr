        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180, where n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, n = 5, so the sum is (5-2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.\nSince the pentagon is regular, all interior angles are equal. Therefore, each interior angle measures 540 / 5 = 108 degrees.\nThe given information that each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 108 degrees is helpful but not necessary to solve the problem, as the question already states that.\nThe triangle ABC is formed by vertices A, B, and C of the pentagon. Since ABC is a triangle, the sum of its interior angles is 180 degrees.\nThe angle ABC is an interior angle of the pentagon, so it measures 108 degrees.\nIn triangle ABC, angle ABC is 108 degrees.\nAlso, since ABCDE is a regular pentagon, the lengths of sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are equal. Therefore, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.\nSince AB=BC, angle BAC = angle BCA.\nLet angle BAC = x. Then angle BCA = x.\nUsing the sum of the interior angles in triangle ABC, we have:\nangle BAC + angle BCA + angle ABC = 180 degrees\nx + x + 108 = 180\n2x + 108 = 180\n2x = 180 - 108\n2x = 72\nx = 72 / 2\nx = 36\nTherefore, angle CAB = 36 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$ degrees.
