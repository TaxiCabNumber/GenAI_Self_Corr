        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular box has interior dimensions 6-inches by 5-inches by 10-inches. The box is filled with as many solid 3-inch cubes as possible, with all of the cubes entirely inside the rectangular box. What percent of the volume of the box is taken up by the cubes?",
        "inference": "The volume of the rectangular box is 6 inches * 5 inches * 10 inches = 300 cubic inches.\nThe volume of one 3-inch cube is 3 inches * 3 inches * 3 inches = 27 cubic inches.\nThe maximum number of cubes that can fit in the box is (6 inches / 3 inches) * (5 inches / 3 inches) * (10 inches / 3 inches) = 2 * 1 * 3.33...  Since the number of cubes must be a whole number, the maximum number of cubes is 2 * 1 * 3 = 6\nThus, the total volume of the cubes is 6 cubes * 27 cubic inches/cube = 162 cubic inches.\nThe percent of the volume taken up by the cubes is (162 cubic inches / 300 cubic inches) * 100% = 0.54 * 100% = 54%.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54%}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Three-inch cubes can fill a rectangular box only if the edge lengths of the box are all integer multiples of 3 inches.  The largest such box whose dimensions are less than or equal to those of the $6''\\times5''\\times10''$ box is a $6''\\times3''\\times9''$ box.  The ratio of the volumes of these two boxes is  \\[\n\\frac{6\\cdot3\\cdot9}{6\\cdot5\\cdot10}=\\frac{3\\cdot9}{5\\cdot10}=\\frac{27}{50},\n\\] which is $\\boxed{54}$ percent."
