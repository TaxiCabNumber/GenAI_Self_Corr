        "inference": "1. Find the area of the triangle.\nUsing Heron's formula, first find the semi-perimeter $s = \\frac{7+7+6}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\nThe area of the triangle is $\\sqrt{10(10-7)(10-7)(10-6)} = \\sqrt{10(3)(3)(4)} = \\sqrt{360} = 6\\sqrt{10}$.\n\n2. Find the height of the triangle.\nLet the height from $A$ to $BC$ be $h$.\nThe area of the triangle is also $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times h = 6\\sqrt{10}$.\nThis gives $3h = 6\\sqrt{10}$, so $h=2\\sqrt{10}$.\n\n3. Find the inradius $r$.\nThe area of the triangle is also given by $A = rs$, where $r$ is the inradius and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.\n$6\\sqrt{10} = r \\times 10$\n$r = \\frac{6\\sqrt{10}}{10} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$ I hope it is correct.",
