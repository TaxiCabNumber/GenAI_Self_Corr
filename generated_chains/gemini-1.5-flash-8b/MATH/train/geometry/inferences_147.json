        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKadin makes a snowman by stacking snowballs of radius 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches.  Assuming all his snowballs are spherical, what is the total volume of snow he uses, in cubic inches?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\nThe first snowball has a radius of 2 inches, so its volume is $V_1 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(8) = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nThe second snowball has a radius of 3 inches, so its volume is $V_2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(27) = 36\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nThe third snowball has a radius of 5 inches, so its volume is $V_3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (5^3) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(125) = \\frac{500}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nThe total volume is the sum of the volumes of the three snowballs:\n$V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi + 36\\pi + \\frac{500}{3}\\pi = \\left(\\frac{32}{3} + 36 + \\frac{500}{3}\\right)\\pi = \\left(\\frac{32+108+500}{3}\\right)\\pi = \\frac{640}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3}\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
