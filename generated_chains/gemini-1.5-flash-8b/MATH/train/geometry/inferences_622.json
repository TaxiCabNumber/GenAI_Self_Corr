Let a be the smallest possible number with the property that it is always possible to select one pair of points from these five such that the distance between them is equal to or less than $a$. Then $a$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{3}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{2}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{2}$\n",
        "inference": "Divide the square into four equal subsquares.  By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two points will lie in the same subsquare.  The maximum distance between two points in the same subsquare is the diagonal of the subsquare, which is $\\sqrt{2}/2$.  Thus $a \\le \\sqrt{2}/2$.\nConsider a square with side length 1.  Divide the square into four subsquares, each of side length $1/2$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of the five points must lie in the same subsquare. The subsquares are formed by dividing the square into $2 \\times 2$ subsquares. The side length of the subsquares is $1/2$, so the diagonal length of the subsquares is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2}$.  The maximum distance between two points in the same subsquare is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}/2$.  Therefore, $a \\leq \\sqrt{2}/2$.\n\nConsider placing the five points at the vertices of a square with side length $1/2$ and the center of the square. The distance between any two points is $\\sqrt{(1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2} = \\sqrt{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}/2$.\nAlso, place the five points at the four vertices of a $1\\times 1$ square and the center of the square. The maximum distance is the distance between two opposing vertices of the $1\\times 1$ square, which is $\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe can place the five points at the vertices of a square with side length $1/2$ and at the center of this square. The distance between any pair of points in the square is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nThe maximum distance between any two points in a $1\\times 1$ square is $\\sqrt{2}$, the distance between opposite vertices.\nDivide the square into four equal subsquares. The side length is $1/2$.  By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of the points will fall within the same subsquare. The distance between any two points in a subsquare can be at most the length of the diagonal of a subsquare, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2}$. Thus $a \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}/2}$",
        "ground_truth": "Partition the unit square into four smaller squares of sidelength $\\frac{1}{2}$. Each of the five points lies in one of these squares, and so by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists two points in the same $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ square - the maximum possible distance between them being $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ by Pythagoras."
