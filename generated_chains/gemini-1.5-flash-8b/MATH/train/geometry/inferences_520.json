I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?",
        "inference": "The surface area of a pyramid with faces being triangles is the sum of the areas of the triangular faces. Since every edge has length 18 or 41, and no face is equilateral, the faces must be of the form $18-18-x$, $18-41-x$, $41-41-x$, or some combination of these.  The area of a triangle with sides $a, b, c$ is given by Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$ where $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.  If two sides are equal (i.e., isosceles triangle), we can use $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the sides $a$ and $b$. The surface area will be the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces.  Since the possible edge lengths are 18 and 41, and no face is equilateral, the triangles must have sides of the form $18-18-x$, $18-41-x$, $41-41-x$, where $x$ can vary.\n\nHowever, the problem states that each edge is 18 or 41, and every face is a triangle. The sides of the pyramid are either all 18 or 41. Each face can have edges of length 18 and 41. For example, if each triangle has sides 18, 18, 18, we are told that no face is equilateral.  The only possibilities for the triangles in the faces are isosceles triangles with sides 18, 18, 41 or 41, 41, 18, with sides 18, 41, 41.\n\nSince every edge is 18 or 41, and no face is equilateral, the faces are isosceles triangles with sides 18, 18, x, where x is different from 18.  The possible faces are 18-18-41 and 18-41-41.  A triangle with sides 18, 18, 41 is not equilateral, and neither are 18-41-41.\nThe possible faces are isosceles triangles with 18 and 41 as possible sides, and no face can be equilateral.\nIf the triangles are 18, 18, 41, then there are 4 such triangles.\nThe area of a triangle with sides 18, 18, 41 can be calculated using Heron's formula.\nLet the triangle have sides 18, 18, 41. The semi-perimeter is $s = \\frac{18+18+41}{2} = \\frac{77}{2} = 38.5$.\n$Area = \\sqrt{38.5(38.5-18)(38.5-18)(38.5-41)} = \\sqrt{38.5 \\times 20.5 \\times 20.5 \\times (-2.5)} = undefined$\n\nIn a general case, we would use Heron's formula, but no face is equilateral.  This problem can be solved with triangles with sides 18, 18, 41, or 41, 41, 18, or 18, 41, 41. There are 4 such triangles.\nSurface Area = 4 * Area(18, 18, 41)\nArea(18, 18, 41) = $\\sqrt{38.5(20.5)^2(-2.5)} =  18(41/2)\\sin(\\theta)$, which depends on angle $\\theta$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{488}$",

Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above).
