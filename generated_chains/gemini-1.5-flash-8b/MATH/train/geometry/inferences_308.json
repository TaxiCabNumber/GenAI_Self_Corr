I hope it is correct.'\nA square pyramid has a base edge of 32 inches and an altitude of 1 foot. A square pyramid whose altitude is one-fourth of the original altitude is cut away at the apex of the original pyramid. The volume of the remaining frustum is what fractional part of the volume of the original pyramid?",
        "inference": "Let the original square pyramid have base edge $b=32$ inches and altitude $h_1 = 1$ foot $= 12$ inches.\nThe volume of the original pyramid is $V_1 = \\frac{1}{3} b^2 h_1 = \\frac{1}{3} (32^2)(12) = \\frac{1}{3} (1024)(12) = 4096$ cubic inches.\n\nThe smaller square pyramid cut away has an altitude $h_2 = \\frac{1}{4} h_1 = \\frac{1}{4}(12) = 3$ inches.\nThe ratio of the altitudes is $\\frac{h_2}{h_1} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSince the altitudes are proportional, the edges of the bases are proportional. Let $b_2$ be the edge of the base of the smaller pyramid. Then $\\frac{b_2}{b} = \\frac{h_2}{h_1}$, so $\\frac{b_2}{32} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $b_2 = 32/4 = 8$ inches.\n\nThe volume of the smaller pyramid is $V_2 = \\frac{1}{3} b_2^2 h_2 = \\frac{1}{3} (8^2)(3) = \\frac{1}{3} (64)(3) = 64$ cubic inches.\n\nThe volume of the frustum is $V_1 - V_2 = 4096 - 64 = 4032$ cubic inches.\n\nThe fraction of the volume of the original pyramid is $\\frac{V_1 - V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{4032}{4096} = \\frac{4032/64}{4096/64} = \\frac{63}{64}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/4, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/64) = \\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$ of the original pyramid."
