At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?",

Reflecting over the y-axis changes the x-coordinate to its opposite.\n$C(2,2)$ reflected over the x-axis to $C'(2,-2)$.\nThen reflecting $C'(2,-2)$ over the y-axis to $C''(-2,-2)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-2,-2)}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$."
