        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?",
        "inference": "1. Volume of the cube-shaped container: $10^3 = 1000$ cubic inches.\n2. Volume of the container that is half full with water: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 = 500$ cubic inches.\n3. Volume of one giant ice cube: $2^3 = 8$ cubic inches.\n4. Total volume of ten giant ice cubes: $10 \\times 8 = 80$ cubic inches.\n5. Total volume occupied by water and ice: $500 + 80 = 580$ cubic inches.\n6. Volume unoccupied by ice or water: $1000 - 580 = 420$ cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{420}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice."
