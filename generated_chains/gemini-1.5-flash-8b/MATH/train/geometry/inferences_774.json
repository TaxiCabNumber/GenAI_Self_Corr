Rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form:\n   $x^2 - 12x + y^2 = 28$\n   $(x^2 - 12x + 36) + y^2 = 28 + 36$\n   $(x-6)^2 + y^2 = 64$\n   This is a circle centered at $(6,0)$ with radius $r = 8$.\n\n2. Find the intersection points of the circle and the line $y = 6-x$:\n   Substitute $y = 6-x$ into the equation of the circle:\n   $(x-6)^2 + (6-x)^2 = 64$\n   $x^2 - 12x + 36 + 36 - 12x + x^2 = 64$\n   $2x^2 - 24x + 72 = 64$\n   $2x^2 - 24x + 8 = 0$\n   $x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$\n   Using the quadratic formula,\n   $x = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 4(1)(4)}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{128}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm 8\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n   So the x-coordinates of the intersection points are $x_1 = 6 - 4\\sqrt{2}$ and $x_2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n   The corresponding y-coordinates are $y_1 = 6 - (6 - 4\\sqrt{2}) = 4\\sqrt{2}$ and $y_2 = 6 - (6 + 4\\sqrt{2}) = -4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n3. Determine the portion of the circle above the x-axis and to the right of the line $y=6-x$.\n   Since $y_1 = 4\\sqrt{2} > 0$ and $y_2 = -4\\sqrt{2} < 0$, only the first intersection point lies in the desired region.\n   The relevant part of the circle is in the first quadrant, and the portion above the x-axis is given by the arc between the points $(6-4\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2})$ and $(6+4\\sqrt{2}, -4\\sqrt{2})$. Since $y=6-x$, the x coordinate of the second intersection is greater than the first intersection. Thus, the part above the x-axis and to the right of the line $y=6-x$ is between $x = 6-4\\sqrt{2}$ and $x=6+4\\sqrt{2}$.

The area is one-quarter of the circle minus the area under the line segment and above the $x$-axis.\n   The area of the sector above the x-axis and to the right of the line is the area of the sector from $(6, 0)$ to $(6-4\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2})$, which is a region in the first quadrant.\n   The sector is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the circle's area = $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi(8)^2=16\\pi$.\n   The area of the triangle formed by the line segment $y=6-x$ and the x-axis with the points $(6,0)$, and the intersections with the line is $\\frac{1}{2} (8\\sqrt{2})^2 = 32$.\n   The required area is $\\frac{1}{4}(64\\pi)-\\int_{6-4\\sqrt{2}}^{6+4\\sqrt{2}} (6-x) dx$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16\\pi - 32}$",
