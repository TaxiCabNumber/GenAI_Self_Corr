        "inference": "The problem states the volume of a prism is 8 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 32 = 512 cubic inches.  A cube with the same volume has a side length 's' such that s\u00b3 = 512.  Taking the cube root, s = 8 inches. The surface area of a cube is 6s\u00b2.  Therefore, the surface area is 6 \u00d7 8\u00b2 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384 square inches.\n\n$\\boxed{384}$\n",
