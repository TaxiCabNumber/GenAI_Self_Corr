        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?",
        "inference": "1. The fly walks from one edge to the opposite edge through the center. This forms a diameter. The length of the diameter is 2 * radius = 2 * 58 = 116 feet.\n\n2. The third part of the journey is 80 feet.\n\n3. The fly walks from the center to another edge. This is a radius, which is 58 feet.  Let the new point be A and the original point be B. The fly walks from B to the center (C), then from C to A, then from A back to B. The triangle ABC is not necessarily a right triangle.\n\n4. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC, we have\n   $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AC * BC * cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between AC and BC.\n   $AB^2 = 58^2 + 58^2 - 2 * 58 * 58 * cos(\\theta)$.  Since AC and BC are both radii, they have the same length, and triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.\n\n\n5.  The third leg is 80 feet.  Using the Law of Cosines in the triangle formed by the starting point, the point across the diameter, and the endpoint of the 80-foot leg gives a triangle with sides 58, 58, and 80.\n6. Using the Law of Cosines again on triangle ABC:\n   $80^2 = 58^2 + 58^2 - 2 * 58 * 58 * cos(\\theta)$\n   $6400 = 3364 + 3364 - 6784 cos(\\theta)$\n   $6400 = 6728 - 6784 cos(\\theta)$\n   $-328 = -6784 cos(\\theta)$\n   $cos(\\theta) = \\frac{328}{6784} = \\frac{41}{848} \\approx 0.0485$\n   $\\theta = cos^{-1}(\\frac{41}{848}) \\approx 87.1^{\\circ}$\n\n7.  Let's find the length of the second part of the journey.  The triangle formed by the first point on the circle, the second point, and the center is an isosceles triangle with sides 58, 58, and a base of length AB.\n   We want to find the length of the second part of the journey. \n   The sum of the legs is $2 \\times 58 + 80 = 116+80=196$\n   The length of the second part of the journey, using the Law of Cosines:\n\n   $80^2 = 58^2 + 58^2 - 2 \\times 58^2 \\cos(\\theta)$\n\n   The sum of the first two parts is $116+secondLegLength$.  The second leg is not equal to 58. The third leg is 80. \n   $2 * 58 + 80 = 116 + 80 = 196$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{196}$",
        "ground_truth": "The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet.
