        "ground_truth": "Each of sector $ABD$ and $BDC$ is one-sixth of a full circle of radius $12,$ so each has area one-sixth of the area of a circle of radius $12.$ Therefore, each sector has area $$\\frac{1}{6}(\\pi(12^2))=\\frac{1}{6}(144\\pi)=24\\pi.$$ Thus, the area of figure $ABCD$ is $2( 24\\pi)=\\boxed{48\\pi}.$"
