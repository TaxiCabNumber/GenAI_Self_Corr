        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square $XYZW$.  The vertices of the triangle are $A(0,0)$, $B(3,0)$, and $C(0,4)$.  The square $XYZW$ has sides parallel to the sides of the triangle. The coordinates of $X$ and $Y$ lie on the line $AC$, and $X$ and $Y$ are $s$ units apart.  Similarly, $W$ and $Z$ are $s$ units apart on $AB$ and $BC$ respectively.\nThe equation of line $AC$ is $y = -\\frac{4}{3}x + 4$. The equation of line $BC$ is $y = -\\frac{4}{3}(x-3)$.\nThe x-coordinate of $W$ is $3-s$, so $W = (3-s, 0)$. Since $X$ lies on $AC$, $X = (x, -\\frac{4}{3}x+4)$, and $Y = (x+s, -\\frac{4}{3}(x+s)+4)$. $W=(3-s, 0)$. The y-coordinate of $Z$ is $4 - \\frac{4}{3}(3-s) = 4-4+\\frac{4}{3}s = \\frac{4}{3}s$. Thus, $Z=(3-s, \\frac{4}{3}s)$. Since $XYZW$ is a square, the side $XY$ is parallel to $WZ$, so $Z = (x_Z, 4-\\frac{4}{3}(3-s)) = (3-s, \\frac{4}{3}s)$.\nSince $XY$ is parallel to $WZ$, $4-\\frac{4}{3}x = 0$. Then $x=3$. \nThe height from $C$ to $AB$ is 4, and the base is 3. Thus the area of triangle $ABC = (1/2)(3)(4) = 6$.  \nIf $W = (3-s, 0)$ and $Y=(x+s, y)$, then $y = -\\frac{4}{3}(x+s)+4 = -\\frac{4}{3}x-\\frac{4}{3}s+4$.\nSince $XY=s$,  $s^2 = 2\\left( 4-\\frac{4}{3}x\\right)^2 = \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}(x+s)+4 - \\left( -\\frac{4}{3}x+4\\right)\\right)^2$\nThe area of triangle $ABC = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6$.  The area of the square is $s^2$. Since $XYZW$ is inscribed, the altitude of triangle $XYZW$ is $s$ and the base is $3-2s$. Thus, the area of the square $s^2 = (\\text{altitude}) (\\text{base})$.\nThe ratio of the areas of the square to the triangle is 1:3.  Area of triangle ABC = 6. So $\\frac{s^2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. This implies $s^2 = 2$.  $s=\\sqrt{2}$, which doesn't work.  The similar triangles give $s^2 = \\frac{12}{5}$.\nThe height of the triangle from $C$ to $AB$ is 4.  Using similar triangles, $\\frac{s}{4} = \\frac{3-2s}{3}$. Solving gives $3s = 12 - 8s$, so $11s = 12$, $s = 12/11$.\nConsider the height from C to AB is 4. Then $\\frac{s}{4} = \\frac{3-x-s}{3}$. Then $3s = 12 - 4(x+s)$, or $12 - 12/5$. $12/5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$",
