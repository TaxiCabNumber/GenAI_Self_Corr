I hope it is correct.'\nCarla rotated point $A$ 420 degrees clockwise about point $B$ and it landed at point $C$. Devon rotated the original point $A$ $x$ degrees counterclockwise about point $B$ and it also landed at point $C$. If $x<360$, what is the value of $x$?",

        "ground_truth": "Carla's rotation was equivalent to one of $60^{\\circ}$ clockwise. To get to the same point by going counter-clockwise, we have to go $360^{\\circ}$ minus Carla's rotation, or $\\boxed{300^{\\circ}}$."
