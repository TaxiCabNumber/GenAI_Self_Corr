        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?",
        "inference": "1. Surface area of a cube with side length 's' is 6s\u00b2.  Given the surface area of the outer cube is 24 m\u00b2, we have 6s\u00b2 = 24, so s\u00b2 = 4, and s = 2 meters.\n\n2. The diameter of the inscribed sphere is equal to the side length of the outer cube, which is 2 meters.  Therefore, the radius of the sphere is 1 meter.\n\n3. The inner cube is inscribed within the sphere. The diagonal of the inner cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 2 meters.\n\n4. Let 'x' be the side length of the inner cube. The diagonal of a cube with side length 'x' is x\u221a3.  So x\u221a3 = 2.\n\n5. Solving for x, x = 2/\u221a3 = (2\u221a3)/3 meters.\n\n6. The surface area of the inner cube is 6x\u00b2 = 6 * [(2\u221a3)/3]\u00b2 = 6 * [4 * 3 / 9] = 6 * (4/3) = 8 square meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters."
