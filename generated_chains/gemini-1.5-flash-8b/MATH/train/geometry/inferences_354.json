At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBonnie makes the frame of a cube out of 12 pieces of wire that are each six inches long. Meanwhile Roark uses 1-inch-long pieces of wire to make a collection of unit cube frames that are not connected to each other. The total volume of Roark's cubes is the same as the volume of Bonnie's cube. What is the ratio of the total length of Bonnie's wire to the total length of Roark's wire? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        "inference": "Bonnie's cube has 12 edges, each 6 inches long.\nThe total length of wire Bonnie uses is $12 \\times 6 = 72$ inches.\n\nThe volume of Bonnie's cube is found by taking the side length of the cube, which is 6 inches.

Each of Roark's unit cubes has volume $1$ cubic inch, so he needs $216$ cubes.\n\nSince each cube has $12$ edges, each of Roark's cubes has $12\\cdot1=12$ inches of wire.
