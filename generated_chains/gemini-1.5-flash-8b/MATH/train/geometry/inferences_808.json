        "inference": "1. The area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}(ZC+WD)\\times CD = 120$.\n2. Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AD=BC=12$ and $CD=AB=12$. Also, $AZ=WC=6$. Thus, $ZC=AD-AZ = 12-6 = 6$ and $WD=BC-WC = 20-6 = 14$.\n3. Substituting these values into the area formula: $\\frac{1}{2}(6+14)\\times 12 = 120$, which gives $\\frac{1}{2}(20)\\times 12 = 120$, which is correct.\n4. The height of triangle $ABQ$ from $Q$ to $AB$ is given by the equation $h_Q = 20 - 14 = 6$.\n5. The height of triangle $BQW$ can be found using similar triangles. The slope of line segment $ZW$ is $\\frac{14-6}{0-12} = \\frac{8}{-12} = -\\frac{2}{3}$.\n6. The equation of line $ZW$ is $y-14 = -\\frac{2}{3}(x-0)$.\n7. The intersection point $Q$ is where $y = 10$ and $x=6$.\n8. The equation of the line segment $ZW$ is $y = -\\frac{2}{3}x+14$.\n9. The coordinates of point $W$ are $(12,6)$, and of $Z$ are $(0,14)$.\n10. Since $Q$ is on $ZW$, the coordinates of $Q$ are $(x,y)$. $y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 14$. The height of $BQW$ from $W$ to $BQ$ is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4$. The height of triangle $BQW$ is the perpendicular distance from $W$ to $BQ$, which is $6 - 2 = 4$.\n11. The base of triangle $BQW$ is $WQ = \\sqrt{(12-6)^2 + (6-14)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n12. The area of triangle $BQW$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 4 = 20$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$",
        "ground_truth": "Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length.
