I hope it is correct.'\nCharlyn walks completely around the boundary of a square whose sides are each 5 km long. From any point on her path she can see exactly 1 km horizontally in all directions. What is the area of the region consisting of all points Charlyn can see during her walk, expressed in square kilometers and rounded to the nearest whole number?",
        "inference": "1. Charlyn walks around a square with side length 5 km.  The total perimeter is 4 * 5 km = 20 km.\n2. Charlyn can see 1 km horizontally in all directions. This creates a strip of 2 km wide and 20 km long along the boundary of the square.\n3. The area of this strip is 2 km * 20 km = 40 square km.\n4.  Inside the square, Charlyn can see a 1 km wide strip on each side.  These strips overlap to form a larger region inside the square.\n5. The area of the square is 5 km * 5 km = 25 square km.\n6.  The overlapping region inside the square is a 3 km by 3 km square (5 - 2*1 = 3).  The area of this central region is 9 square km.\n7. The total area Charlyn can see is the area of the strip + the area of the central region = 40 square km + 9 square km = 49 square km.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{49}$\n",

        "inference": "Let the square have side length 5 km.  Charlyn can see 1 km horizontally and vertically in all directions.  This creates a 2 km wide strip along each side of the square, with a total length of 20 km.  The area of these strips is 2 km * 20 km = 40 square km.\n\nHowever, there's overlap in the center.  The region Charlyn can see from the inside is a 3 km by 3 km square (5 - 2(1) = 3).
