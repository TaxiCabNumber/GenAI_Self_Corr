At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 4 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "1. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.\n2. With $s=4$, the area is $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(4^2) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(16) = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n3. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $P = 3s$.\n4. With $s=4$, the perimeter is $P = 3(4) = 12$.\n5. The ratio of the area to the perimeter is $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\n6.
