At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?",
        "inference": "Let the original height of the cylinder be $h$ and the original radius be $r$.\nThe original volume of the cylinder is $V_1 = \\pi r^2 h$.\nThe new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r + 200\\% r = r + 2r = 3r$.\nThe new volume of the cylinder is $V_2 = \\pi (3r)^2 (2h) = \\pi (9r^2)(2h) = 18 \\pi r^2 h$.\nThe factor by which the volume is multiplied is $\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\frac{18 \\pi r^2 h}{\\pi r^2 h} = 18$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$."
