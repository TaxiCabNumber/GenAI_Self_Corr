        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lines $y=2$, $y=5$, $x=1$, and $x=a$ make a square. Find the product of the possible values for $a$.",
        "inference": "If the lines $y=2$, $y=5$, $x=1$, and $x=a$ make a square, then the side length of the square must be $5-2=3$.  Since $x=1$ and $x=a$ are two vertical lines, the distance between them must be 3.  This means $|a-1|=3$.  This gives two possible values for $a$: $a=1+3=4$ or $a=1-3=-2$.  The product of the possible values for $a$ is $(4)(-2)=-8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-8}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since the two horizontal lines are $5-2=3$ units apart, we know that the side of the square is $3$ units long. Therefore, the fourth line must be parallel to $x=1$. If $x=a$ is to the left of $x=1$, its equation is $x=1-3=-2$. If $x=a$ is to the right of $x=1$, then its equation is $x=1+3=4$. Therefore, the two values for $a$ are $4$ and $-2$, and their product is $\\boxed{-8}$."
