At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo circles are drawn in a 12-inch by 14-inch rectangle. Each circle has a diameter of 6 inches. If the circles do not extend beyond the rectangular region, what is the greatest possible distance (in inches) between the centers of the two circles?",
        "inference": "The maximum distance between the centers of the two circles occurs when the centers are diametrically opposed corners of a rectangle formed by the circles.\nThe circles have a diameter of 6 inches, so their radius is 3 inches.\nThe rectangle has dimensions 12 inches by 14 inches.\nThe centers of the circles must be within the rectangle.\nTo maximize the distance between the centers, the centers should be as far apart as possible. This occurs when the centers are opposite corners of a rectangle formed by the two circles.  In the case of circles that do not overlap, we can align them along a diagonal.\nOne circle is centered at (3, 3) and the other is centered at (9, 11).  The distance between the centers is $\\sqrt{(9-3)^2 + (11-3)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{36+64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\nThe maximum distance between the centers of the two circles is the length of the diagonal of a rectangle that results from the circles' positions in the given rectangle. The centers are at a distance of 9 inches along the 12-inch side, and 8 inches along the 14-inch side.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the maximum distance is $\\sqrt{9^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 64} = \\sqrt{145}$ inches.\nHowever, the circles must stay inside the rectangle, so we need to consider the positions of the centers.\nTo maximize the distance, place the centers on opposite corners of a rectangle formed by the diameter of each circle, which are perpendicular to the sides of the 12x14 rectangle.\nThe distance between centers along the 12-inch side is 12 - 2 * 3 = 6 inches.\nThe distance between centers along the 14-inch side is 14 - 2 * 3 = 8 inches.\nThe maximum distance between centers is $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2} = \\sqrt{36+64} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$ inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose we put the two circles in opposite corners of the rectangle so that the circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, and they are diagonally across from each other. Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches. Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles. This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches. The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles. It helps if we recognize that these lengths are $3 \\times 2$ and $4 \\times 2$, which means we have a multiple of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean Triple. Thus, the length of the diagonal must be $5 \\times 2 = \\boxed{10\\text{ inches}}$. Indeed, $8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10^2$.
