        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?",
        "inference": "Let the original dimensions of the rectangular base be length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$. The volume of the original pyramid is given by $V = \\frac{1}{3}lwh$.  We are given that $V = 40$.  So $\\frac{1}{3}lwh = 40$.\n\nThe new length is $2l$, the new width is $3w$, and the new height is $h + 0.5h = 1.5h$.\n\nThe volume of the new pyramid is $V' = \\frac{1}{3}(2l)(3w)(1.5h)$.\n$V' = \\frac{1}{3}(2 \\times 3 \\times 1.5)(lwh) = \\frac{1}{3}(9)(lwh) = 9\\left(\\frac{1}{3}lwh\\right) = 9(40) = 360$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches."
