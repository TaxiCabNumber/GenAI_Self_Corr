        "inference": "Let the radius of the ball be $r$. The radius of the circular base of the cylinder is 12 cm and the depth is 8 cm. The center of the circle is on the top of the hole.  Draw a cross-section of the cylinder and the ball. The radius of the circle is 12 cm, so the distance from the center of the ball to the edge of the hole is 12 cm. The depth of the hole is 8 cm, meaning the distance from the center of the circle (which is on the top of the hole) to the bottom of the hole is 8 cm.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the center of the ball to the bottom of the hole is $\\sqrt{12^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 64} = \\sqrt{208}$. The distance from the center of the ball to the top of the hole is $r$. Since the center of the circle is on the top of the hole, the distance from the center of the ball to the top of the hole is $r$.  The distance from the center of the ball to the bottom of the hole is $r - 8$. Thus,  $r - 8 = \\sqrt{12^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{208}$. So $r - 8 = \\sqrt{208}$. Then $r - 8 = \\sqrt{208} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 13} = 4 \\sqrt{13}$. Then $r = 4 \\sqrt{13} + 8$. Since $4 \\sqrt{13} = 4 \\times 3.6056 \\approx 14.4224$ approximately. Then $r \\approx 14.4224 + 8 \\approx 22.4224$.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, $r^2 = 12^2 + (r-8)^2$.\n$r^2 = 144 + r^2 - 16r + 64$\n$0 = 208 - 16r$\n$16r = 208$\n$r = \\frac{208}{16} = 13$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$",
