The two chords divide the interior of the circle into four regions. Two of these regions are bordered by segments of unequal lengths, and the area of either of them can be expressed uniquely in the form $m\\pi-n\\sqrt{d},$ where $m, n,$ and $d$ are positive integers and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number.

        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear and contains conflicting information.  The intersecting chords theorem and the Pythagorean theorem are being applied incorrectly.  We are not given enough information to determine the area of the segments.  However, the given value $\\sqrt{539} \\approx 23.2$ suggests this is related to a perpendicular from the center of the circle to one of the chords.\n\nThe given data ($R=42$, $c_1=78$, $c_2=78$, $d=18$) are consistent.  There are several possible interpretations of the question, and the provided methods seem to be aimed at incorrect interpretations.  Without a clear question, there is no correct answer to provide.  The problem likely requires a calculation involving the intersecting chords theorem and possibly the area of a segment of a circle, but a precise question formulation is needed.\n\nThe given information itself seems contradictory. If the chords have the same length, and the perpendicular distance from the center to each chord is the same, then the chords should be equidistant.
