The question asks for the difference in volume, which is 24/\u03c0 cubic inches.

The problem likely intends for an approximation.  However, since we are asked for the final answer and not the approximation, we must give the exact value.\n\n\nThe question asks for the numerical difference in volume, which is $\\frac{24}{\\pi}$ cubic inches.  This cannot be simplified further.  The question should be clear. If the difference is required in terms of pi, the answer is $\\frac{24}{\\pi}$. If the question asks for an approximation, we can evaluate to get around 7.639.\n\n\n\n$\\boxed{24/\\pi}$\n",
