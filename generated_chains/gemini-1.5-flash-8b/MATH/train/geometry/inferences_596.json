The side length of the blue square is $s-2w$.\nThe area of the blue square is $(s-2w)^2$.\nEach red arm is a triangle. The area of one arm is $\\frac{1}{2} w(s-2w)$.  The area of 4 arms is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} w(s-2w) = 2w(s-2w)$.\nThe total area of the cross is the area of the blue square plus the area of the 4 red arms.\nSo, $ (s-2w)^2 + 2w(s-2w) = 0.36 s^2 $.\n$s^2 - 4sw + 4w^2 + 2ws - 4w^2 = 0.36 s^2$.\n$s^2 - 2sw = 0.36 s^2$.\n$0.64 s^2 = 2sw$.\n$w = \\frac{0.64 s^2}{2s} = 0.32 s$.\nThe area of the blue square is $(s - 2w)^2 = (s - 2(0.32s))^2 = (s - 0.64s)^2 = (0.36s)^2 = 0.1296 s^2$.\nThe percentage of the area of the flag that is blue is $\\frac{0.1296 s^2}{s^2} \\times 100\\% = 0.1296 \\times 100\\% = 12.96\\%$.\nSince the given answer choices are integers, we are looking for the percentage that is closest to 12.96%.\nThe closest integer percentage is 13%.\n\nThe correct approach is to have the total area of the red arms plus the blue square be 36% of the total area. Thus, we should have $(s-2w)^2 + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} w(s-2w) = 0.36s^2$.\n\nThe area of each red arm is $\\frac{1}{2} (2w)(s-2w) = w(s-2w)$.
