At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let the third side have length x.\nThen we have the following inequalities:\n33 + 42 > x\n33 + x > 42\n42 + x > 33\n\nFrom the first inequality, 75 > x.\nFrom the second inequality, x > 9.\nFrom the third inequality, x > -9.  Since x must be positive, this doesn't give us a new constraint.\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have 9 < x < 75.  Since x is an integer, the smallest possible integer value for x is 10.  This gives a perimeter of 33 + 42 + 10 = 85.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{85}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units."
