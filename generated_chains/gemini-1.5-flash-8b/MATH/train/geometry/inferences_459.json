At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven a triangle, its midpoint triangle is obtained by joining the midpoints of its sides. A sequence of polyhedra $P_{i}$ is defined recursively as follows: $P_{0}$ is a regular tetrahedron whose volume is 1. To obtain $P_{i + 1}$, replace the midpoint triangle of every face of $P_{i}$ by an outward-pointing regular tetrahedron that has the midpoint triangle as a face. The volume of $P_{3}$ is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

        "ground_truth": "On the first construction, $P_1$, four new tetrahedra will be constructed with side lengths $\\frac 12$ of the original one.

The outward tetrahedron for the midpoint triangle provides $3$ of the faces, while the three equilateral triangles surrounding the midpoint triangle provide the other $3$. This is because if you read this question carefully, it asks to add new tetrahedra to each face of $P_{i}$ which also includes the ones that were left over when we did the previous addition of tetrahedra. However, the volume of the tetrahedra being constructed decrease by a factor of $\\frac 18$. Thus we have the recursion $\\Delta P_{i+1} = \\frac{6}{8} \\Delta P_i$, and so $\\Delta P_i = \\frac 12 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{i-1} P_1$.\nThe volume of $P_3 = P_0 + \\Delta P_1 + \\Delta P_2 + \\Delta P_3 = 1 + \\frac 12 + \\frac 38 + \\frac 9{32} = \\frac{69}{32}$, and $m+n=\\boxed{101}$.
