        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe congruent sides of an isosceles triangle are each 5 cm long, and the perimeter is 17 cm. In centimeters, what is the length of the base?",
        "inference": "Let the congruent sides of the isosceles triangle be 'a' and 'a', and the base be 'b'.\nThe perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is given as 17 cm.  So, a + a + b = 17.\nSince the congruent sides are each 5 cm long, a = 5.\nSubstituting a = 5 into the perimeter equation gives 5 + 5 + b = 17.\nSimplifying the equation: 10 + b = 17.\nSubtracting 10 from both sides: b = 17 - 10.\nThus, b = 7 cm.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the length of the base is $b$ centimeters, then the perimeter of the triangle is $5+5+b$ cm.  Solving $5+5+b=17$ we find $b=\\boxed{7}$."
