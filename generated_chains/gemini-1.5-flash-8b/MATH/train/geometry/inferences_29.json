        "inference": "Let $C_1$ be the circle with radius 2 centered at (0, 2), and $C_2$ be the circle with radius 1 centered at (0, 5). The points B and C lie on the x-axis. The point A has y-coordinate 8.  The distance from A to the x-axis is 8, and since A lies on tangent lines to $C_1$ and $C_2$, the distance from A to the x-axis is the sum of the radii, which is $2+1 = 3$.  This means A has coordinates (0, 8).\n\nLet B be (x, 0) and C be (-x, 0).  The distance from B to the center of $C_1$ (0, 2) is 2. Using the distance formula, we have $\\sqrt{x^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = 2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 4 = 4$, so $x^2 = 0$, which implies $x=0$.  This is incorrect. The distance from B to the center of $C_1$ is 2, so we need $\\sqrt{x^2 + (0-2)^2} = 2$.  This gives $x^2 + 4 = 4$, so $x^2=0$, so x=0. This is incorrect. \n\nThe distance from B to (0, 2) is 2, so $\\sqrt{x^2 + (0-2)^2} = 2$.  Then $x^2 + 4 = 4$, so $x = 0$ (which is not possible, since B must be different from C). Let $B = (x, 0)$.  Then the distance from B to (0, 2) is 2, so $\\sqrt{x^2 + 2^2} = 2 + 2 = 4$, which means $x^2 + 4 = 4$, which means x=0.  This is not the correct approach.\n\nBy similar triangles, the distance from A to the x-axis is 2 + 1 = 3. This means A has coordinates (0, 8). The distance from B to the center of $C_1$ (0, 2) is 2. So $\\sqrt{x^2 + (-2)^2} = 2$. This is incorrect. \nBy tangent lines, the distance from A to the x-axis is 2+1=3, so A has coordinates (0,8).  B = (-x,0) and C = (x,0).  By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $\\sqrt{x^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{(x^2 + 64)}$.  Also $\\sqrt{x^2+6} = 3$, so $x^2 + 36 = 9$.\n\n\nThe height is 8, and the base is $2x$. $x = \\sqrt{(x^2+8^2)}$\nBy Pythagorean theorem, $\\sqrt{x^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 36}$.  Distance from B to (0,2) = 2. $\\sqrt{x^2 + 2^2} = 2 \\implies x^2 + 4 = 4 \\implies x^2 = 0$, which is not correct.\n\n$\\sqrt{x^2+(8-2)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 36} = 2 + 2 = 4 \\implies x^2 + 36 = 16$.\n\nThe distance from B to the center (0,2) is 2, so $\\sqrt{x^2+4} = 2$, so $x^2 = 0$.\n\nFrom similar triangles, $x^2 + 4 = 4$, which means x=0, incorrect.\n\n$2 \\sqrt{x^2+36} = 16$.
