At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLisa, a child with strange requirements for her projects, is making a rectangular cardboard box with square bases. She wants the height of the box to be 3 units greater than the side of the square bases. What should the height be if she wants the surface area of the box to be at least 90 square units while using the least amount of cardboard?",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square base.\nThe height is $h = s + 3$.\nThe surface area of the box is given by $SA = 2s^2 + 4sh = 2s^2 + 4s(s+3) = 2s^2 + 4s^2 + 12s = 6s^2 + 12s$.\nWe want the surface area to be at least 90, so $6s^2 + 12s \\ge 90$.\n$6s^2 + 12s - 90 \\ge 0$\n$s^2 + 2s - 15 \\ge 0$\n$(s+5)(s-3) \\ge 0$\nSince $s$ is a side length, $s \\ge 0$. The inequality is satisfied when $s \\le -5$ or $s \\ge 3$. Since $s$ must be positive, $s \\ge 3$.\nTo minimize the amount of cardboard, we want to minimize $s$. The smallest integer value for $s$ is 3.\nIf $s=3$, then $h = 3+3 = 6$.\nThe surface area is $6(3^2) + 12(3) = 6(9) + 36 = 54 + 36 = 90$.\nIf $s=4$, then $h = 4+3 = 7$.\nThe surface area is $6(4^2) + 12(4) = 6(16) + 48 = 96 + 48 = 144$.\nSince we want the least amount of cardboard, we want the smallest possible value of $s$ that satisfies the condition.\n$s = 3$ gives $h = 3+3 = 6$.\nThe surface area is $6(3)^2 + 12(3) = 6(9) + 36 = 54 + 36 = 90$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$. The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$.  Therefore, we must have $$2x^2+4x(x+3) \\ge 90.$$Expanding the product on the left and rearranging gives $ 2x^2+4x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$, so $6x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$.  Dividing by 6 gives  $x^2+2x-15 \\ge 0$, so  $(x+5)(x-3) \\ge 0$.  Therefore, we have $x \\le -5 \\text{ or } x\\ge 3$. Since the dimensions of the box can't be negative, the least possible length of the side of the base is $3$. This makes the height of the box $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNote that we also could have solved this problem with trial-and-error.  The surface area increases as the side length of the base of the box increases.  If we let this side length be 1, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 1^2 + 4(1)(4) = 18$.  If we let it be 2, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 2^2 + 4(2)(5) = 8 + 40 = 48$.  If we let it be 3, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 3^2 + 4(3)(6) = 18+72 = 90$.  So, the smallest the base side length can be is 3, which means the smallest the height can be is $\\boxed{6}$."
