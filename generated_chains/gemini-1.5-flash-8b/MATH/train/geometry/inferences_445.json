The smaller square has vertices $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm 1/2)$.  Since the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ are diagonals of the smaller square, the intersections will not fall on the center of the square.\n\n\nThe vertices of the octagon are $(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$.

The area of each corner triangle is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8. The total corner area is 4 * (1/8) = 1/2.\n\nThe area of the square is 1.
