At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a triangle measure 4 cm and 9 cm. What is the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let the sides be 4, 9, and x.\nThen we have the following inequalities:\n4 + 9 > x\n4 + x > 9\n9 + x > 4\nThe first inequality gives 13 > x.\nThe second inequality gives x > 5.\nThe third inequality gives x > -5.  This last inequality is always true since x is a side length and must be positive.\nCombining the first two inequalities, we have 5 < x < 13.\nThe greatest integer value for x that satisfies this inequality is 12.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side must be smaller than the sum of the first two sides, or 13 cm. That means the greatest integer number of centimeters for the third side is $\\boxed{12}.$"
