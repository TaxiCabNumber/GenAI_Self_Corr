        "inference": "The points are A(0,0), B(6,0), C(3,6), D(6,6), F(0,6).  P(3,3) is the center of the square.  The sides of the square are AB=6, BC=6, CD=6, and DA=6.  The distance from P to each side is the same, so P is the circumcenter of the triangle ABC. Triangle APB is a right triangle with right angle at A.  PA = $\\sqrt{(3-0)^2+(3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.  PB = $\\sqrt{(3-6)^2+(3-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(-3)^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{9+9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.  PC = $\\sqrt{(3-3)^2+(3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{0+9} = 3$.  This triangle isn't isosceles, but is right at A. The area of triangle APB is (1/2)(6)(3\u221a2) = 9\u221a2.   The area of triangle APB is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2)(6)(3) = 9.\n\nThe sides of the square are AB, BC, CD, DA. P is the center of the square.  Thus PA = PB = PC.  This is a square not a triangle.\nThe area of triangle APB is (1/2)(6)(3) = 9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$",
