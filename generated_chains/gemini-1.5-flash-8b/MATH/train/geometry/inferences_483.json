The rope is attached to the tower at ground level and to the unicorn at a height of $4$ feet. The unicorn has pulled the rope taut, the end of the rope is $4$ feet from the nearest point on the tower, and the length of the rope that is touching the tower is $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}c$ feet, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is prime.

        "inference": "The problem statement is ambiguous.  The solution focuses on the length of rope along the tower, which is not what is asked for.  We are looking for the value of $x$ in the expression $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$.\n\nThe closest point on the tower to where the rope touches the ground is 4 feet away from the rope.  The rope is 20 feet long, and the height of the unicorn is 4 feet. The distance along the tower to where the rope touches is found from the Pythagorean theorem. Let $x$ be the distance from the base of the tower to the point where the rope touches the tower.

Perhaps the problem statement has errors.\nHowever, the only information we have is that $8\\sqrt{6}$ is what we calculate.\n\nThere is no correct way to express $8\\sqrt{6}$ in the given form.\n\nThe problem statement needs to be verified.
