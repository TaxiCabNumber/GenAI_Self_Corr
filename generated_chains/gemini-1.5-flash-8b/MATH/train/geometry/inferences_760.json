        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius. We are given that $V = 36\\pi$.\n2. Substituting the given value into the formula, we have $36\\pi = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n3. Divide both sides by $\\pi$: $36 = \\frac{4}{3} r^3$.\n4. Multiply both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$: $36 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = r^3$.\n5. Calculate the value: $27 = r^3$.\n6. Take the cube root of both sides: $r = \\sqrt[3]{27} = 3$.\n7. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\n8. The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4\\pi r^2$.\n9. Substitute the value of $r$ into the formula: $A = 4\\pi (3^2)$.\n10. Calculate the value: $A = 4\\pi (9)$.\n11. Simplify: $A = 36\\pi$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$."
