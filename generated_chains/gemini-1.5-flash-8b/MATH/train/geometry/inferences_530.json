        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the radius of the back wheel from inches to feet:\n   $4$ inches $= \\frac{4}{12}$ feet $= \\frac{1}{3}$ feet.\n\n2. Calculate the circumference of the front wheel:\n   $C_{front} = 2\\pi(2.5) = 5\\pi$ feet.\n\n3. Calculate the circumference of the back wheel:\n   $C_{back} = 2\\pi(\\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ feet.\n\n4. Calculate the distance traveled by the front wheel in 100 revolutions:\n   Distance = $100 \\times C_{front} = 100 \\times 5\\pi = 500\\pi$ feet.\n\n5. Calculate the number of revolutions the back wheel makes to travel the same distance:\n   Revolutions = $\\frac{Distance}{C_{back}} = \\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = 500\\pi \\times \\frac{3}{2\\pi} = 250 \\times 3 = 750$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{750}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$."
