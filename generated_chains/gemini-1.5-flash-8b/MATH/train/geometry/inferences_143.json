        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear about the shape of the shaded area.  If the shaded area consists of the four quarter circles in each tile, then the solution is correct.  If the shaded portion is the square region minus the four quarter circles, then the solution is correct. If the question is that each tile has 4 quarter circles which form a complete circle inside the tile, then the shaded area is the square minus the circle.\n\n\nThe calculation of the shaded area of each tile is correct: 1 sq ft - \u03c0/4 sq ft.  However, if the question refers to the area of the 4 quarter circles composing a full circle within a 1x1 tile, then the shaded portion of each tile is 1 - \u03c0/4.  Multiplying this by the number of tiles results in 80(1 - \u03c0/4). This is the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{80 - 20\\pi}$\n",
