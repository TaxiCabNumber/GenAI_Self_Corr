        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?",
        "inference": "1. **Case 1: The sides are 10 and 20.**  The triangle could be 10-10-20 or 10-20-20.  In the first case, the shortest side is 10.  In the second case, the shortest side is 10. Since the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, the scale factor is 50/10 = 5.\n\n2. **Case 2: The sides are 10 and 20.** The triangle could be 10-10-20 (shortest side = 10 inches) or 10-20-20 (shortest side = 10 inches). In either case, the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches. So the scale factor is 50/10 = 5.\n\n3. **Find the sides of the similar triangle.**  If the sides are 10-10-20, the similar triangle's sides are 10*5 = 50, 10*5 = 50, and 20*5 = 100. If the sides are 10-20-20, the similar triangle's sides are 10*5 = 50, 20*5 = 100, and 20*5 = 100.\n\n4. **Calculate the perimeter of the similar triangle.** In both cases, the perimeter is 50 + 50 + 100 = 200 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle. The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches. If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches. Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{250\\text{ inches}}$."
