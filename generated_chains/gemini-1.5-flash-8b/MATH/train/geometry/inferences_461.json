Let $I$, $J$, and $K$, be the points on $\\overline{EF}$, $\\overline{EH}$, and $\\overline{EC}$, respectively, so that $EI = EJ = EK = 2$. A solid $S$ is obtained by drilling a tunnel through the cube. The sides of the tunnel are planes parallel to $\\overline{AE}$, and containing the edges, $\\overline{IJ}$, $\\overline{JK}$, and $\\overline{KI}$. The surface area of $S$, including the walls of the tunnel, is $m + n\\sqrt {p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n + p$.\n",

Around the corner $E$ we're missing an area of $6$, the same goes for the corner opposite $E$ . So the outside area is $6\\cdot 64 - 2\\cdot 6 = 372$.
