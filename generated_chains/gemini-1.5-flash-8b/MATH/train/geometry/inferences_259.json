I hope it is correct.'\nAn ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?",
        "inference": "1. The volume of a cone is given by the formula V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n2. In this case, the radius of the cone is 1 inch and the height is 4 inches.\n   V_cone = (1/3)\u03c0(1^2)(4) = (4/3)\u03c0 cubic inches.\n3. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0r^3, where r is the radius.\n4. We want to find the radius of the sphere that has the same volume as the cone, so we set the two volumes equal to each other:\n   (4/3)\u03c0 = (4/3)\u03c0r^3\n5. Dividing both sides by (4/3)\u03c0, we get:\n   1 = r^3\n6. Taking the cube root of both sides, we find the radius of the sphere:\n   r = \u221b1 = 1\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch."
