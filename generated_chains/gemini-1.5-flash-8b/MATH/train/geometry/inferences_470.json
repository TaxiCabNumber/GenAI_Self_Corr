        "inference": "The problem statement implies that points P, Q, and R are vertices of a triangle that has sides that are also sides of a cube.  The lengths of the sides are calculated correctly.  However, there is no relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the sides of a cube.  To find the side length of a cube, more information is needed. The given triangle is equilateral but doesn't imply the sides are related to a cube.\n\nThe calculation of the surface area of a cube requires the length of a side of the cube, not the triangle.\n\nThere's a missing step in the reasoning.  We have the side lengths of the equilateral triangle but no way to determine the side length of a cube from this information. The problem is flawed.\n\nThe provided solution attempts to connect the equilateral triangle to a cube but that connection isn't valid.  The solution is incorrect.\n\nWithout further context or diagram, it's impossible to determine the surface area of a cube.\n\n$\\boxed{Insufficient Information}$\n",
