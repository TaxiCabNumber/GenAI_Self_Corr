I hope it is correct.'\nA circular sheet of paper with radius of $6$ cm is cut into three congruent sectors. What is the height of the cone in centimeters that can be created by rolling one of the sections until the edges meet? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "1. The circumference of the circular sheet is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi(6) = 12\\pi$ cm.\n2. Since the sheet is cut into three congruent sectors, the arc length of each sector is $\\frac{1}{3}(12\\pi) = 4\\pi$ cm.\n3. When the sector is rolled into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.\n4. Let $r$ be the radius of the base of the cone. Then $2\\pi r = 4\\pi$, which means $r = 2$ cm.\n5. The radius of the original circular sheet is $6$ cm.\n6. The slant height of the cone is the radius of the original circular sheet, which is $6$ cm.\n7. Let $h$ be the height of the cone. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $h^2 + r^2 = (6)^2$.\n8. Substituting $r=2$, we get $h^2 + 2^2 = 6^2$, so $h^2 + 4 = 36$.\n9. Solving for $h$, we have $h^2 = 32$, and $h = \\sqrt{32} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$ cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$4\\sqrt{2}$ cm}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
