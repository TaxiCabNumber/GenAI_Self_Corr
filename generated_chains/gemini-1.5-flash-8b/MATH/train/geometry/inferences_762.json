        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?",
        "inference": "A prism has two parallel congruent bases and lateral faces that are parallelograms.\nThe number of edges of a prism is given by $2n + 3$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the base.\nIn this case, the number of edges is 15.\nSo, $2n + 3 = 15$\n$2n = 12$\n$n = 6$\nThe prism has 6 sides on each base.\nThe number of faces of a prism is $2 + n = 2 + 6 = 8$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total."
