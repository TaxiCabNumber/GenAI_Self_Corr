        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding heights.  Let $h_1$ and $h_2$ be the heights of the smaller and larger triangles, respectively. Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be the areas of the smaller and larger triangles, respectively. We are given that $A_1:A_2 = 1:4$, which means $\\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.  Since the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the heights, we have $\\frac{h_1^2}{h_2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. We are given $h_1 = 3$ cm. Substituting this into the equation, we get $\\frac{3}{h_2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Solving for $h_2$, we get $h_2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters."
