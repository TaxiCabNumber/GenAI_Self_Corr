I hope it is correct.'\nCircle $B$ has its center at $(-6, 2)$ and a radius of $10$ units. What is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis?",
        "inference": "1. The equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.\n2. For circle $B$, the equation is $(x-(-6))^2 + (y-2)^2 = 10^2$, which simplifies to $(x+6)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 100$.\n3. Points on the $y$-axis have an $x$-coordinate of 0.  Substitute $x=0$ into the equation:\n   $(0+6)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 100$\n   $36 + (y-2)^2 = 100$\n   $(y-2)^2 = 64$\n4. Taking the square root of both sides:\n   $y-2 = \\pm 8$\n5. Solve for the two possible $y$-values:\n   $y-2 = 8 \\implies y = 10$\n   $y-2 = -8 \\implies y = -6$\n6. The two $y$-coordinates are 10 and -6.\n7. The sum of the $y$-coordinates is $10 + (-6) = 4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$.
