Since all three triangles share an angle, it follows that they must be similar. Notice that the base of $T_3$ is equal to $2+4+6 = 12$, and its height is equal to $6$. This, the height-to-base ratio of each of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equal to $6/12 = 1/2$. Since the base of $T_1$ is $2$ and the base of $T_2$ is $2+4 = 6$, it follows that their heights are, respectively, $2 \\cdot (1/2) = 1$ and $6 \\cdot (1/2) = 3$.
