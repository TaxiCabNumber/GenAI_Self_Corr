At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of the volume of a cube with edge length six inches to the volume of a cube with edge length one foot? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "1. The volume of a cube with edge length $s$ is given by $s^3$.\n2. The volume of a cube with edge length 6 inches is $6^3 = 216$ cubic inches.\n3. One foot is equal to 12 inches.\n4. The volume of a cube with edge length 1 foot (which is 12 inches) is $12^3 = 1728$ cubic inches.\n5. The ratio of the volume of the first cube to the volume of the second cube is $\\frac{216}{1728}$.\n6. Simplify the fraction: $\\frac{216}{1728} = \\frac{216 \\div 216}{1728 \\div 216} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$"
