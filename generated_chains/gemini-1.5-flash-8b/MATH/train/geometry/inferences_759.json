At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the square be $s$. The area of the square is $s^2 = 6 \\text{ cm}^2$. Thus $s = \\sqrt{6} \\text{ cm}$.\nWhen the paper is folded, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area.\nThe folded part forms a right triangle with the diagonal as the hypotenuse. The two legs of the right triangle are each equal to the side length of the square, $s = \\sqrt{6}$.\nLet $x$ be the distance from point A to its original position.\nThe area of the visible black region is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} s^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 6 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe visible white area is equal to the visible black area, so the white area is also $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe visible white area can also be found by subtracting the black area from the total area, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe diagonal of the square is $\\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 6^2} = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe area of the visible white area is equal to the area of the visible black area.\nThe distance from $A$ to the diagonal is the same as the distance from $A$ to the fold line.\nLet the distance from $A$ to the fold line be $x$. Then the distance from the fold line to the midpoint of the side is $\\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2}$.\nThe triangle formed by the fold line is a right triangle with hypotenuse $s$ and one leg being $x$. The other leg is half of $s$, which is $\\frac{s}{2}$.\nBy Pythagorean Theorem, $x^2 + (\\frac{s}{2})^2 = s^2$.\n$x^2 + \\frac{s^2}{4} = s^2$\n$x^2 = s^2 - \\frac{s^2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}s^2$\n$x^2 = \\frac{3}{4} (6) = \\frac{18}{4} = \\frac{9}{2}$\n$x = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ cm.

        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position."
