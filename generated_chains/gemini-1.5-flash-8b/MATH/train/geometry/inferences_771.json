The shaded region is a rhombus.  The vertices of the rhombus are (2.5, 5), (7.5, 5), (5, 10), (5, 0). The diagonals of the rhombus are segments from (2.5, 5) to (7.5, 5) and from (5, 10) to (5, 0).

The area of a rhombus is (1/2)*d1*d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.  Therefore, the area of the shaded rhombus is (1/2)*(5)(10) = 25 square cm.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{25}$",
