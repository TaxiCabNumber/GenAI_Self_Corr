        "inference": "Assuming the problem intends to find the area of the circular base of a fountain, given that $AC$ is the radius of the circular base, and the triangle $ADC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $D$.\n\nWe are given that $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, and $AB = 16$.
