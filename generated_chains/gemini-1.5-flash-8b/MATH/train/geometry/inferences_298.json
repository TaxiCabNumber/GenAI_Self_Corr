What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$?",
        "inference": "1. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with angle A congruent to angle B, we know that angle A = angle B.\n2. Let the measure of angle A be x degrees. Then the measure of angle B is also x degrees.\n3. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180.\n4. Substituting the values we found in step 2, we get x + x + angle C = 180.\n5. Simplifying, we get 2x + angle C = 180.\n6. We are given that angle C is 30 degrees more than angle A. This means angle C = x + 30.\n7. Substituting this expression for angle C into the equation from step 5, we get 2x + (x + 30) = 180.\n8. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 180.\n9. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 3x = 150.\n10. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 50.\n11. Now we can find the measure of angle C by substituting x = 50 into the equation from step 6: angle C = 50 + 30 = 80.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $A$.  Then angle $B$ measures $x$ degrees as well and angle $C$ measures $x+30$ degrees.  Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we solve $x+x+x+30=180$ to find $x=50$.  Therefore, angle $C$ measures $x+30=50+30=\\boxed{80}$ degrees."
