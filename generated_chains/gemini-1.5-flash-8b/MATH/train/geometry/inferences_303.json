At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?",
