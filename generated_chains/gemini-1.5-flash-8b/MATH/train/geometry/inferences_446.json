At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways. The truck travels at $50$ miles per hour along the highways and at $14$ miles per hour across the prairie. Consider the set of points that can be reached by the firetruck within six minutes. The area of this region is $m/n$ square miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
        "inference": "Let the coordinates of the firetruck be $(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are in miles.\nIf the firetruck travels along the highways, then the time taken to reach a point $(x,y)$ is given by $t = \\frac{|x| + |y|}{50}$.\nIf the firetruck travels across the prairie, then the time taken to reach a point $(x,y)$ is given by $t = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{14}$.\nThe time taken to reach any point in the region is at most six minutes, which is $\\frac{6}{60} = \\frac{1}{10}$ hours.\nSo, we have two cases:\nCase 1: The firetruck travels along the highways. The condition is $\\frac{|x|+|y|}{50} \\le \\frac{1}{10}$.\nThis gives us $|x| + |y| \\le 5$.\nCase 2: The firetruck travels across the prairie.

The square has area $2 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 50$. The circle has radius $1.4$, so its area is $\\pi (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \\pi$.\nThe area is approximately $50 - \\pi (1.4)^2 \\approx 50 - 6.1575 \\approx 43.8425$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$",
