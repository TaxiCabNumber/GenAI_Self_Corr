        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The volume of a sphere with radius r is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. The volume of a cylinder with radius R and height h is \u03c0R\u00b2h.\n\nThe volume of the spherical scoop is (4/3)\u03c0(2\u00b3) = (4/3)\u03c0(8) = (32/3)\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nThe melted ice cream forms a cylinder with radius 8 inches. Let h be the depth of the melted ice cream. The volume of the cylinder is \u03c0(8\u00b2)h = 64\u03c0h cubic inches.\n\nSince the density of the ice cream remains constant, the volumes must be equal.\n(32/3)\u03c0 = 64\u03c0h\nh = (32/3\u03c0) / (64\u03c0)\nh = (32/3) / 64\nh = 32 / (3 * 64)\nh = 1 / 6 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.
