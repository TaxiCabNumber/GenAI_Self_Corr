        "inference": "1.  From the given information, we have $DC = 7$, $CB = 8$, $AB = \\frac{1}{4} AD$, and $ED = \\frac{4}{5}AD$.\n2.  Since $AB + BC + CD = AD$, we have $\\frac{1}{4} AD + 8 + 7 = AD$. This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{4}AD + 15 = AD$, which gives $\\frac{3}{4}AD = 15$.  Therefore, $AD = \\frac{15 \\times 4}{3} = 20$.\n3.  Now we know $AD = 20$, so $AB = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 20 = 5$, and $ED = \\frac{4}{5} \\times 20 = 16$.\n4.  Since $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle EFD$ are similar triangles, we have $\\frac{BC}{FC} = \\frac{AB}{FD} = \\frac{AC}{EF}$. We are given $BC = 8$, and we need to find $FC$.  Notice that $\\triangle EFD$ is similar to $\\triangle ABC$.  In the context of the given diagram, the lengths of segments are related in the following way: $\\frac{FC}{BC} = \\frac{FD}{AB}$. From this, we can use the fact that triangles $ABC$ and $EFD$ are similar, meaning that the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. We have $\\frac{BC}{CF} = \\frac{AB}{FD}$. We can deduce that $\\frac{8}{CF} = \\frac{5}{FD}$, but we cannot determine $FD$ from the provided information.\n5. We have the similar triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle EFD$. The height of $\\triangle ABC$ is $4$, and the height of $\\triangle EFD$ is $16$.\n6. Since the heights are in the ratio of 4/16 = 1/4, we have $\\frac{16}{4} = \\frac{ED}{BC}$, so we have $4 = \\frac{ED}{BC} = \\frac{16}{8}$, which means that $\\frac{AB}{FD} = \\frac{5}{FD} = \\frac{BC}{CF}$. From similar triangles we get\n   $\\frac{8}{CF} = \\frac{5}{FD}$.\n   Consider the heights of similar triangles.\n   The ratio of heights is $\\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$. This means the ratio of corresponding sides is also $\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus we have $\\frac{8}{CF} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies CF = 32$.\n7. The ratio of heights is $\\frac{4}{16}$. From the similar triangles $ABC$ and $EFD$, we have $\\frac{AB}{FD} = \\frac{BC}{CF} = \\frac{AC}{EF}$. Thus, $\\frac{8}{CF} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{5}{FD}$, $\\frac{8}{CF} = \\frac{1}{4}$, so $CF = 32$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32}$",
