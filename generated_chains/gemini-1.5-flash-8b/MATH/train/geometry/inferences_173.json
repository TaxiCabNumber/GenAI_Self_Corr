Since $A$ coincides with $O$ when $\\triangle ABC$ is folded over $\\overline{BC}$, $O$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$.  Let $B=(x_B, y_B) = (0, 4)$ and $C=(x_C, y_C) = (0, 1)$.

This means that $OM$ is a horizontal line. The line $BC$ is vertical, with equation $x = 0$.  Thus, the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ is the line $y=2.5$.\nThe perpendicular bisector of $BC$ passes through $O=(3.5, 2.5)$. Since $A$ and $O$ coincide after folding, $OA = OB$ and $OA = OC$.

The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from $A$ to $BC$. The perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$ intersects $BC$ at the midpoint of $BC$.
