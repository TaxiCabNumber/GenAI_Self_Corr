The diameter is 10 cm, so the radius is $r = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$ cm.\n3. The height is given as $h = 6$ cm.\n4. Plugging the values into the formula, we get:\n$V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5^2)(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (25)(6) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (150) = 50\\pi$ cubic centimeters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.",
