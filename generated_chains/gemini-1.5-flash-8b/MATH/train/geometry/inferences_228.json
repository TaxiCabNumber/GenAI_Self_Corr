At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?",
        "inference": "The trapezoid has bases along the vertical lines $x=1$ and $x=5$. The height of the trapezoid is the difference in the x-coordinates, which is $5-1=4$. The lengths of the bases are the differences in the y-coordinates: $1 - (-2) = 3$ (for the base along $x=1$) and $7 - 1 = 6$ (for the base along $x=5$). The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.  Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\frac{1}{2}(9)(4) = 18$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units."
