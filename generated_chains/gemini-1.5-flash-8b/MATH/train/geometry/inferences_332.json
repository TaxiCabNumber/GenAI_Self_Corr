If a particular frustum has an altitude of $24$ centimeters, the area of its lower base is $225\\pi$ sq cm and the area of its upper base is $25\\pi$ sq cm, what is the altitude of the small cone that was cut off?

The height of the smaller cone that was removed is given by similar triangles.  The ratio of the radii is 15/5 = 3.  The ratio of the heights must also be 3, so if h is the height of the frustum (24 cm), the height of the smaller cone is (1/3)h.
