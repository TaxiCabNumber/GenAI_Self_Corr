        "inference": "Let $a = \\sqrt{2u-1}$, $b = \\sqrt{2u+1}$, and $c = 2\\sqrt{u}$.\nBy the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $a+b > c \\implies \\sqrt{2u-1}+\\sqrt{2u+1} > 2\\sqrt{u}$\n    \\item $a+c > b \\implies \\sqrt{2u-1}+2\\sqrt{u} > \\sqrt{2u+1}$\n    \\item $b+c > a \\implies \\sqrt{2u+1}+2\\sqrt{u} > \\sqrt{2u-1}$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFor $a+b > c$, we have $\\sqrt{2u-1} + \\sqrt{2u+1} > 2\\sqrt{u}$.
