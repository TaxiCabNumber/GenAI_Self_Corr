When the tripod is set up, the angle between any pair of legs is equal to the angle between any other pair, and the top of the tripod is $4$ feet from the ground. In setting up the tripod, the lower 1 foot of one leg breaks off. Let $h$ be the height in feet of the top of the tripod from the ground when the broken tripod is set up. Then $h$ can be written in the form $\\frac m{\\sqrt{n}},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.

        "inference": "Let the equilateral triangle formed by the three legs have side length $s=5$ feet.  The altitude from the top of the triangle to the base is $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ feet. The top of the tripod is 4 feet from the ground.  This means the altitude of the tripod (the segment from the top to the base of the equilateral triangle) is 4 feet.\n\nThe problem likely asks for the horizontal distance from the foot of a leg to the foot of the altitude. Let $x$ be this distance.  Then by Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by a leg, the altitude, and the projection of the leg to the altitude, we have $x^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$.  Solving for $x$:\n$x^2 + 16 = 25$\n$x^2 = 9$\n$x = 3$\n\nThe distance from the base to the foot of the altitude is 3.

Each has length 3.  If we consider one leg, it has length 5. The altitude has length 4.  Let $x$ be the distance from the base to the foot of the altitude.
