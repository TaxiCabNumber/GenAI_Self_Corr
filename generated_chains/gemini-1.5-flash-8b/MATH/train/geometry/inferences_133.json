        "inference": "By similar triangles, $\\frac{AE}{EC} = \\frac{AB}{CD}$. Since $AB = 2CD$, we have $\\frac{AE}{EC} = \\frac{2CD}{CD} = 2$.  Thus, $AE = 2EC$.  Also, $AE + EC = AC = 11$.  Substituting $AE = 2EC$ into the equation, we get $2EC + EC = 11$, which simplifies to $3EC = 11$.  Solving for $EC$, we get $EC = \\frac{11}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{3}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the bases of the trapezoid are $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, these two line segments must be parallel. Now, since $\\overline{AC}$ intersects these two parallel lines, $\\angle DCE$ and $\\angle BAE$ are alternate interior angles and therefore must be congruent. Similarly, $\\overline{DB}$ intersects the bases, so $\\angle CDE$ and $\\angle ABE$ are congruent. We have two pairs of congruent angles, so $\\triangle DCE \\sim \\triangle BAE$ by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.\n\nSides of similar triangles are proportional, so since the lengths of sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are related in a $2:1$ proportion, we also have that $EA/EC=2/1$, so the length of $\\overline{EC}$ must be $1/3$ that of $\\overline{AC}$. Since $\\overline{AC}$ has length $11$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}$."
