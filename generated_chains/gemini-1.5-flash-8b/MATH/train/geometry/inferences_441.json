Let $A$ be at the origin, $B$ at $(20,0,0)$, $C$ at $(20,0,20)$, and $D$ at $(20,20,20)$. Thus, $P$ is at $(5,0,0)$, $Q$ is at $(20,0,15)$, and $R$ is at $(20,10,20)$.\nLet the plane $PQR$ have the equation $ax + by + cz = d$. Using point $P$, we get that $5a = d$. Using point $Q$, we get $20a + 15c = d \\Longrightarrow 4d + 15c = d \\Longrightarrow d = -5c$. Using point $R$, we get $20a + 10b + 20c = d \\Longrightarrow 4d + 10b - 4d = d \\Longrightarrow d = 10b$. Thus plane $PQR$\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equation reduces to $\\frac{d}{5}x + \\frac{d}{10}y - \\frac{d}{5}z = d \\Longrightarrow 2x + y - 2z = 10$.\nWe know need to find the intersection of this plane with that of $z = 0$, $z = 20$, $x = 0$, and $y = 20$. After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$. Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.\nWe can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now. There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\\sqrt{5}$. The other two are of $45-45-90 \\triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\\sqrt{2}$. So we have a hexagon with sides $15\\sqrt{2},5\\sqrt{5}, 5\\sqrt{5},15\\sqrt{2}, 5\\sqrt{5},5\\sqrt{5}$ By symmetry, we know that opposite angles of the polygon are congruent. We can also calculate the length of the long diagonal by noting that it is of the same length of a face diagonal, making it $20\\sqrt{2}$.\n[asy] size(190); pointpen=black;pathpen=black; real s=2^.5; pair P=(0,0),Q=(7.5*s,2.5*s),R=Q+(0,15*s),Pa=(0,20*s),Qa=(-Q.x,Q.y),Ra=(-R.x,R.y); D(P--Q--R--Pa--Ra--Qa--cycle);D(R--Ra);D(Q--Qa);D(P--Pa); MP(\"15\\sqrt{2}\",(Q+R)/2,E); MP(\"5\\sqrt{5}\",(P+Q)/2,SE); MP(\"5\\sqrt{5}\",(R+Pa)/2,NE); MP(\"20\\sqrt{2}\",(P+Pa)/2,W); [/asy]\nThe height of the triangles at the top/bottom is $\\frac{20\\sqrt{2} - 15\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}\\sqrt{2}$.
