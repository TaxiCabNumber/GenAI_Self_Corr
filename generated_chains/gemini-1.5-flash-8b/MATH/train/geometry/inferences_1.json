        "inference": "The key to this problem is that $RS$ is the perpendicular from $R$ to $PQ$.\nWe are given that $\\sin \\angle RPQ = \\frac{7}{25}$.\nSince $\\sin(\\angle RPS) = \\frac{RS}{RP}$, we need to know the relationship between $\\angle RPS$ and $\\angle RPQ$.\nSince $RS$ is the perpendicular from $R$ to $PQ$, $\\angle PSR = 90^\\circ$.\nIn right triangle $RPQ$, $RS$ is the altitude from the right angle $R$.\nIn right triangle $RPS$, $\\sin(\\angle RPS) = \\frac{RS}{RP}$.\nBy the definition of sine in right triangle $RPQ$, $\\sin(\\angle RPQ) = \\frac{RQ}{RP} = \\frac{7}{25}$.\nIn right triangle $RPS$, $\\sin(\\angle RPS) = \\frac{RS}{RP}$.\nIn the right triangle $RPQ$, we have $\\angle RPQ = \\alpha$ and $\\sin \\alpha = \\frac{7}{25}$.\nHowever, we are not given any information about $\\angle RPS$.\nIf $S$ is the foot of the altitude from $R$ to $PQ$, then $\\angle RPS$ and $\\angle RPQ$ could be any values between 0 and 90 degrees.\nIn right triangle $RPS$, $\\angle PRS$ is the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the side $RS$.\nIn right triangle $RPQ$, we are given that $\\sin \\angle RPQ = \\frac{7}{25}$. Since $RS$ is the perpendicular from $R$ to $PQ$, $\\sin(\\angle RPS) = \\frac{RS}{RP}$. However, there is no direct relationship given between $\\angle RPS$ and $\\angle RPQ$. The given diagram does not imply a specific relationship between these two angles. Thus, the value of $\\sin \\angle RPS$ is not determined.\nHowever, if $S$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $R$ to $PQ$, we have that $\\angle RPQ$ and $\\angle RPS$ are complementary. Thus $\\sin \\angle RPS = \\sin (\\angle RPQ) = \\frac{7}{25}$. This is the only condition where we can determine $\\sin \\angle RPS$.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{7}{25}}$\n",
