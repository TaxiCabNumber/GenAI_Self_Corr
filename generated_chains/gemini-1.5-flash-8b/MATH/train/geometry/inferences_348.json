I hope it is correct.'\nFrom a circular piece of paper with radius $BC$, Jeff removes the unshaded sector shown.  Using the larger shaded sector, he joins edge $BC$ to edge $BA$ (without overlap) to form a cone of radius 12 centimeters and of volume $432\\pi$ cubic centimeters.  What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $ABC$ of the sector that is not used?
