        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA two-gallon container had all of its dimensions tripled. How many gallons does the new container hold?",
        "inference": "Let the original dimensions of the container be length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$. The volume of the container is $V = lwh$.\nThe new dimensions are $3l$, $3w$, and $3h$. The volume of the new container is $V' = (3l)(3w)(3h) = 27lwh = 27V$.\nThe original volume is 2 gallons. The new volume is $27 \\times 2 = 54$ gallons.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$ gallons. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that our two-gallon container is in the shape of a rectangular prism. If we triple the length, the volume triples. Tripling the width or the height gives us the same result. Therefore, tripling all of the dimensions increases the volume by a factor of $3\\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27$. The new container can hold $2 \\times 27 = \\boxed{54}$ gallons."
