        "ground_truth": "Since $5>4$, $4$ cannot be the length of the hypotenuse. Thus either $4$ and $5$ are the lengths of the two smaller sides, or $5$ is the hypotenuse, meaning the two smaller sides are $4$ and $3$. In this latter case, the area will be smaller, so the area is $\\frac{(3)(4)}{2} = \\boxed{6}$."

        "inference": "The problem states that the area of a right triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}ab$ where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two legs.  Case 1 correctly calculates the area as 10.\n\nCase 2:  The hypotenuse is given as one of the sides.  If the given sides are 4 and 5, and 5 is the hypotenuse, we have $4^2 + b^2 = 5^2$, which gives $b^2 = 9$ and $b = 3$.
