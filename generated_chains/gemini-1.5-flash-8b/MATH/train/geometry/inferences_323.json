        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe midpoints of the sides of a triangle with area $T$ are joined to form a triangle with area $M$. What is the ratio of $M$ to $T$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let the triangle be $ABC$. Let $D, E, F$ be the midpoints of $BC, AC, AB$ respectively.\n$DEF$ is the medial triangle.\nThe area of triangle $DEF$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ the area of triangle $ABC$.\nTherefore, $M = \\frac{1}{4} T$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you get a segment which is half as long as the third side of the triangle. Therefore, every side in the smaller triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the side length of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ the area of the larger triangle."
