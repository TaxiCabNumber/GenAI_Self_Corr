        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEric builds a small pyramid for a school project. His pyramid has a height of twelve inches and a square base that measures ten inches on each side. Eric wants to find the smallest cube-shaped box to put his pyramid in so that he can safely bring it to school right side up. What is the volume of this box, in inches cubed?",
        "inference": "The pyramid has a square base with side length 10 inches.  The height is 12 inches.\nThe pyramid's volume is (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (10^2) * 12 = 400 cubic inches.\n\nThe smallest cube-shaped box that will contain the pyramid right-side up must have a side length at least as large as the pyramid's dimensions.\nThe base of the pyramid is 10 inches wide, and the height is 12 inches.\nThe cube must have a side length at least 10 inches to fit the base of the pyramid, and 12 inches to fit the height.\nSo, the smallest cube will have side length 12 inches, which is the height of the pyramid.\n\nThe volume of the cube is side^3 = 12^3 = 1728 cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$ inches cubed. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The height of the pyramid is $12$ inches, so the height of the box must be at least $12$ inches. The base of the pyramid is $10$ inches on each side, so the minimum dimensions of the length and width of the box must be $10$. Since we want a cube-shaped box, we need to choose the dimensions of the box so that everything will fit inside. Because $12>10$, we want a cube-shaped box that measures $12$ inches on each side. (If we chose a box that measured $10$ inches on each side, it wouldn't be able to accommodate the height of the pyramid.) Therefore, the volume of the box is $12^3=\\boxed{1728}$ inches cubed."

        "inference": "The pyramid has a square base with side length 10 inches and a height of 12 inches.  To contain the pyramid right-side up, the smallest cube needs to be at least 10 inches wide and 12 inches tall.  The diagonal of the base is $\\sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = 10\\sqrt{2}$. The slant height from the apex to a corner of the base is  $\\sqrt{6^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{36+144} = \\sqrt{180} = 6\\sqrt{5} \\approx 13.42$.\nThe smallest cube must have a side length of at least the largest dimension of the pyramid. The largest dimension is the height of 12 inches. The base of the pyramid has sides of length 10 inches, so the smallest cube has a side length of 12 inches.\nVolume of cube = side^3 = 12^3 = 1728 cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$",
