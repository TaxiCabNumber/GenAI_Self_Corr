Suppose that the radius of the circle is $5$, that $BC=6$, and that $AD$ is bisected by $BC$. Suppose further that $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$. It follows that the sine of the central angle of minor arc $AB$ is a rational number. If this number is expressed as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms, what is the product $mn$?\n[asy]size(100); defaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)+fontsize(11pt)); dotfactor=1; pair O1=(0,0); pair A=(-0.91,-0.41); pair B=(-0.99,0.13); pair C=(0.688,0.728); pair D=(-0.25,0.97); path C1=Circle(O1,1); draw(C1); label(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,W); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,N); draw(A--D); draw(B--C); pair F=intersectionpoint(A--D,B--C); add(pathticks(A--F,1,0.5,0,3.5)); add(pathticks(F--D,1,0.5,0,3.5)); [/asy]\n",

It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.\nNow, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle. Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.\nThe rest of this problem is straightforward.\nOur goal is to find $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$."
