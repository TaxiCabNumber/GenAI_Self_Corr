        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "1. **Determine if it's a right triangle:** Use the Pythagorean theorem.  14\u00b2 + 48\u00b2 = 196 + 2304 = 2500 = 50\u00b2.  Since 14\u00b2 + 48\u00b2 = 50\u00b2, the triangle is a right triangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the area of a right triangle:** The area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height. In this case, the base and height are the two shorter sides.\n\n3. **Calculate the area:** Area = (1/2) * 14 cm * 48 cm = 336 cm\u00b2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{336}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters."
