        "inference": "The problem states that the y-coordinates of the vertices are distinct elements of $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$.  The problem also states that the hexagon is equilateral and the vertices have x and y coordinates.  The y-coordinates are given in the list.  It doesn't mention anything about x-coordinates being in any particular order, so the arrangement is not necessarily regular.  Since $\\angle FAB=120^\\circ$, the given information describes a regular hexagon.\nGiven the y-coordinates, we can arrange the vertices in a regular hexagon.  If we let $A=(0,0)$, then $B=(b,2)$, etc.  Since the hexagon is equilateral, all sides have the same length.\nWe have the vertices $A(0,0), B(b,2), C(c,4), D(d,6), E(e,8), F(f,10)$.\nHowever, since the hexagon is regular, the vertices are $A(0,0)$, $B(b,2)$, $C(b+2\\cos(60^\\circ), 4)$,...\nWe can use the property that in a regular hexagon, the distance from the origin to any vertex is the same.\nIf we use the fact that $\\angle FAB=120^\\circ$, then $AB = \\sqrt{b^2+4}$.\nIf we let $y_A=0$, $y_B=2$, $y_C=4$, ... then in a regular hexagon with side length $a$, the y-coordinates are equally spaced.\nIf the hexagon is regular, then all sides have the same length.  A regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle.\nIf we let the vertices of the regular hexagon be $A(0,0)$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$ then $y_A=0, y_B=2, y_C=4, y_D=6, y_E=8, y_F=10$.  The $x$-coordinates need to be determined.\nThe side length $a$ of the equilateral hexagon must satisfy the relation $a^2 = x_0^2+y_0^2$.\nConsider the vertices arranged so the y-coordinates are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.  Then $AB^2=b^2+4$, and $AB=a$.  In a regular hexagon, $A(0,0), B(x_0,y_0)$ are separated by an angle of $60^\\circ$.  We need to find $a$, then we can find the area.\nIf $A=(0,0)$, and $B=(b,2)$.  Then $AB^2 = b^2 + 4 = a^2$.\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all sides have the same length $a$.  The distance between two vertices with y-coordinates $y_1$ and $y_2$ will be equal.\n$AB=a = \\sqrt{(b-0)^2+(2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{b^2+4}$.\nWe need to calculate the area of the regular hexagon.  $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}a^2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$",
