        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pipe with inside diameter 10'' is to carry water from a reservoir to a small town in an arid land. Neglecting the friction and turbulence of the water against the inside of the pipes, what is the minimum number of 2''-inside-diameter pipes of the same length needed to carry the same volume of water to the arid town?",
        "inference": "1. The cross-sectional area of the 10'' pipe is given by the area of a circle with radius 5 inches:  A\u2081 = \u03c0(5\u00b2) = 25\u03c0 in\u00b2\n\n2. The cross-sectional area of the 2'' pipe is given by the area of a circle with radius 1 inch:  A\u2082 = \u03c0(1\u00b2) = \u03c0 in\u00b2\n\n3. To carry the same volume of water, the total cross-sectional area of the smaller pipes must equal the area of the larger pipe.  Let 'n' be the number of 2'' pipes.\n\n4.  n * A\u2082 = A\u2081\n\n5.  n * \u03c0 = 25\u03c0\n\n6.  n = 25\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the pipes be $h$.  The volume of the 10-inch pipe is $\\pi (5^2) (h) = 25\\pi h$ cubic inches and the volume of each 2-inch pipe is $\\pi (1^2)(h) = \\pi h$ cubic inches.  Hence we see it takes exactly 25 2-inch pipes to match the volume of one 10-inch pipe.  The answer is $\\boxed{25}$ pipes."
