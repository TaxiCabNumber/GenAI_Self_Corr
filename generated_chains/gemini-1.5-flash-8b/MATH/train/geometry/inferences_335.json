I hope it is correct.'\nA circular cylindrical post with a circumference of 4 feet has a string wrapped around it, spiraling from the bottom of the post to the top of the post. The string evenly loops around the post exactly four full times, starting at the bottom edge and finishing at the top edge. The height of the post is 12 feet.

        "inference": "If the string wraps around the post 4 times, the horizontal distance covered by the string is not 4 times the circumference.  Instead, it is the circumference times the number of times wrapped, meaning 4*4 = 16 ft. The height of the post is 12 feet. The string forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 16 ft and 12 ft.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem:  \u221a(16\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(256 + 144) = \u221a400 = 20 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$",
