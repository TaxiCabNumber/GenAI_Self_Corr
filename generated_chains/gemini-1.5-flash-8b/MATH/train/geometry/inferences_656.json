        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nParallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?",
        "inference": "Reflecting $D(4,1)$ across the $x$-axis gives $D'(4,-1)$.\nReflecting $D'(4,-1)$ across the line $y=x+1$ involves finding the equation of the line perpendicular to $y=x+1$ passing through $D'(4,-1)$.\nThe slope of $y=x+1$ is 1. The slope of the perpendicular line is $-1$. The equation of the perpendicular line is $y-(-1)=-1(x-4)$, which simplifies to $y+1=-x+4$, or $y=-x+3$.\nTo find the intersection point of $y=-x+3$ and $y=x+1$, we set $-x+3=x+1$, which gives $2x=2$, so $x=1$. Then $y=1+1=2$. The intersection point is $(1,2)$.\nThe midpoint of $D'(4,-1)$ and $D''$ is $(1,2)$, so we have $\\frac{4+x_2}{2} = 1$ and $\\frac{-1+y_2}{2}=2$. This gives $4+x_2=2$, so $x_2=-2$, and $-1+y_2=4$, so $y_2=5$. The coordinates of $D''$ are $(-2,5)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-2,5)}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$."

        "inference": "To reflect a point across a line, we find the midpoint of the point and its reflection and that midpoint lies on the line of reflection. The line connecting the point and its reflection is perpendicular to the line of reflection.\n\nThe given point is $D(4,1)$.
