At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?",
        "inference": "Original volume = 15 cm * 10 cm * 8 cm = 1200 cm\u00b3\nVolume of one cube removed = 3 cm * 3 cm * 3 cm = 27 cm\u00b3\nNumber of cubes removed = 8\nTotal volume removed = 8 * 27 cm\u00b3 = 216 cm\u00b3\nPercent removed = (216 cm\u00b3 / 1200 cm\u00b3) * 100% = 18%\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18%}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
