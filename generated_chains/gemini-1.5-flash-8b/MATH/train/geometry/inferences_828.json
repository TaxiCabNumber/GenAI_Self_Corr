In $\\triangle ABD$, $\\angle DAB = 180 - (55 + 40) = 85^\\circ$.\n5.  $\\angle DCB + \\angle CBD + \\angle CDB = 180^\\circ$. In $\\triangle CBD$, $\\angle DCB = 180 - (55 + 75) = 50^\\circ$.\n6. Using the Law of Sines on $\\triangle ABD$, $\\frac{AB}{\\sin 40^\\circ} = \\frac{AD}{\\sin 55^\\circ} = \\frac{BD}{\\sin 85^\\circ}$.\n7.

The length of BD is the same in both triangles, but the angles are different.\n9. By the Law of Sines, the ratio of the side length to the sine of the opposite angle is constant. Since the angle in $\\triangle ABD$ is larger than the angle in $\\triangle CBD$ for the side BD, BD is the same in both triangles.\n10. To compare the lengths of the sides, we need to use the Law of Sines in both triangles.\n11. From $\\triangle ABD$: $\\frac{AB}{\\sin 40^\\circ} = \\frac{BD}{\\sin 85^\\circ} \\Rightarrow AB = \\frac{\\sin 40^\\circ}{\\sin 85^\\circ} \\times BD$.\n12.

The problem gives no information about the side lengths, but it does allow us to compare the ratios. This means that side lengths are not comparable, unless the ratio can be known.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{BD}$ I hope it is correct.",
