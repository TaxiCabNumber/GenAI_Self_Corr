        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?",
        "inference": "The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius of the base, and $h$ is the height.\nWe are given that the volume is $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters and the height is 4 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get\n$12\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 (4)$\n$12\\pi = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^2$\n$12 = \\frac{4}{3} r^2$\n$r^2 = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 9$\n$r = 3$ cm\nThe radius of the base is 3 cm.\nThe circumference of the base of the cone is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius.\nSubstituting $r = 3$ cm into the formula, we get\n$C = 2\\pi (3) = 6\\pi$ cm\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$."
