        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBrad has a cylindrical barrel with radius 10 inches and height 15 inches.  He wants to fill it from a well, using a bucket in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 10 inches. How many trips must Brad make to the well in order to fill the barrel?",
        "inference": "1. Volume of the cylindrical barrel:  V_barrel = \u03c0 * r^2 * h = \u03c0 * (10 inches)^2 * (15 inches) = 1500\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\n2. Volume of the hemispherical bucket: V_bucket = (1/2) * (4/3) * \u03c0 * r^3 = (2/3) * \u03c0 * (10 inches)^3 = 2000\u03c0/3 cubic inches.\n\n3. Number of trips = V_barrel / V_bucket = (1500\u03c0 cubic inches) / (2000\u03c0/3 cubic inches) = 1500\u03c0 * (3/2000\u03c0) = 4.5 trips.\n\n4. Since Brad can't make a fraction of a trip, he needs to make 5 trips.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel.  Let $r$ be ten inches.   The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 . \\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \\text{ in} = \\frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \\[ \\pi r^2 \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi r^3 . \\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \\[ \\frac{(3/2) \\pi r^3}{(2/3) \\pi r^3} = \\frac{9}{4}\n= 2 + \\frac{1}{4} . \\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\\boxed{3}$ trips to the well."
