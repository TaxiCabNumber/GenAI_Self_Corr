        "inference": "The problem statement gives a condition that $AM$ is the median to side $BC$ in a triangle $ABC$ where $AB=4$ and $AC=3$. The formula for the length of the median to the side $BC$ is not generally $\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2}$, and the result depends on the angle $BAC$.\n\nTo find the length of the median $AM$, we need more information about the triangle $ABC$.
