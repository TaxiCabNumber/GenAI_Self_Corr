Since each child can be male or female with equal likelihood, there are $2^6=64$ possible ways in which the genders of the children can be determined. The only way in which Mr. Jones won't have more sons than daughters or more daughters than sons is if he has exactly 3 of each, which can occur in $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways.
