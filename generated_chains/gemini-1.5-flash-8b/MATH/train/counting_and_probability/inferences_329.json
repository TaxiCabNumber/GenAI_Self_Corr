        "inference": "Let the four-digit number be represented as $1abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits from 0 to 9. Since the number has exactly two identical digits, the possible cases are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The first digit $1$ is repeated. Then $a=1$, and $b=c$ for some $b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$. In this case, $b$ can be any digit except $1$, so there are 9 possible values for $b$. Thus there are 9 such numbers.\n    \\item The second digit $a$ is repeated. Then $a \\in \\{0, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$. Since $a$ is repeated, the number is $1aa$, $1a1b$.\n        If $a \\ne 1$, $a$ can be any digit from 0 to 9.  If $a=1$, then the number is $11xx$, where $x_1 = x_2$. In this case $11b1, 1111$.\n        If $a \\in \\{0, 2, \\dots, 9\\}$, we have two choices for the repeated digit. One choice for $b$, which can be any digit from 0 to 9 except $a$, and one choice for $c$. Thus, there are 9 choices for $b \\ne a$.\n        We have 9 choices for $a$ and 9 choices for $b$, giving 81 such numbers.\n    \\item The third digit $b$ is repeated. Then $b \\ne 1$. There are 9 choices for $b$. Then $c = b$, so $a$ and $c$ can be any digit from 0 to 9 except $b$. There are 9 choices for $a$ and 9 choices for $c$. So we have 9 x 9 = 81 such numbers.\n    \\item The fourth digit $c$ is repeated. Then $c \\ne 1$. There are 9 choices for $c$. Then $b = c$, so $a$ and $b$ can be any digit from 0 to 9 except $c$. There are 9 choices for $a$ and 9 choices for $b$. So we have 9 x 9 = 81 such numbers.\n\\end{enumerate}\nFor the cases where the repeated digit is in the second position, the first and last digits are different from each other and from the repeated digit. So the repeated digit can be 0-9 (excluding 1) and can be in any of the three positions, so there are $9 \\times 9 = 81$ ways.\nHowever, if the repeated digit is 1, then the second position must be different from 1. So there are 9 ways.\nTotal possible numbers is $9 + 9 \\times 9 \\times 2 = 9 + 81 \\times 2 = 9+162=171$.\nIn total, we have 9 choices for the repeating digit and 9 choices for the other digit.\nIn the case where the second digit is repeated, we have 9 choices for the second digit (0 to 9 excluding 1). For the first and third digits, we have 9 choices each. So we have 9 x 9 = 81 numbers.\nSimilarly, for the third and fourth digit, we have 81 numbers.\nTotal is $9 \\times 9 + 81 = 81+81=162$.\nThus $9 \\times 9 \\times 2 = 9\\times 18 = 162$.\n$9+162=171$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{171}$",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$. Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$.
