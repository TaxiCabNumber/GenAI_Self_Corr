At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pizza parlor offers six toppings. What is the greatest number of four-topping pizzas that can be made such that no two pizzas have the same topping combination?",
        "inference": "To find the greatest number of four-topping pizzas, we need to determine the number of possible combinations of four toppings from six available toppings. This is a combination problem, since the order in which the toppings are chosen does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 (the number of toppings) and k = 4 (the number of toppings per pizza).\n\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{4! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15 $$\n\nTherefore, there are 15 possible four-topping pizzas.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 6 choices of toppings, and each pizza must have 4 of them, there are ${6 \\choose 4} = \\boxed{15}$ four-topping pizzas."
