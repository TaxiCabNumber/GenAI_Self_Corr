At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe have a standard deck of 52 cards, with 4 cards in each of 13 ranks.  We call a 5-card poker hand a full house if the hand has 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (such as 33355 or AAAKK).  What is the probability that five cards chosen at random form a full house?",
        "inference": "There are $\\binom{52}{5}$ total possible 5-card hands.\n\nFirst, we choose 2 ranks. There are $\\binom{13}{2}$ ways to choose 2 ranks.\nFor each of the chosen ranks, we need to choose the number of cards of each rank.  For the rank with 3 cards, there are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose 3 cards of that rank. For the rank with 2 cards, there are $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 cards of that rank.\nThus, the number of full houses is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2} \\times 4 \\times 6 = 78 \\times 24 = 1872$.\nThe probability of getting a full house is $\\frac{1872}{\\binom{52}{5}} = \\frac{1872}{2598960} = \\frac{1872/24}{2598960/24} = \\frac{78}{108290} = \\frac{39}{54145} \\approx 0.00072$.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 ranks from 13 is $\\binom{13}{2} = \\frac{13\\times12}{2} = 78$.\nFor each of these ranks, choose 3 cards of one rank in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways, and 2 cards of another rank in $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\nThe number of full houses is $78 \\times 4 \\times 6 = 78 \\times 24 = 1872$.\nThe total number of possible 5-card hands is $\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2,598,960$.\nThe probability of getting a full house is $\\frac{1872}{2598960} = \\frac{1872}{2598960} = \\frac{39}{54145} \\approx 0.00072$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{39}{54145}}$ I hope it is correct.",
