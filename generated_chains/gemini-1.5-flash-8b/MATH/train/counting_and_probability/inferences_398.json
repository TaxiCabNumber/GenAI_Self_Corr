At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA game show offers a contestant three prizes A, B and C, each of which is worth a whole number of dollars from $$ 1$ to $$ 9999$ inclusive. The contestant wins the prizes by correctly guessing the price of each prize in the order A, B, C. As a hint, the digits of the three prices are given. On a particular day, the digits given were $1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3$. Find the total number of possible guesses for all three prizes consistent with the hint.\n",
        "inference": "Let the prices of prizes A, B, and C be $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.\nThe digits given are $1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3$.\nThe total number of digits is 7.\nThe prices of the prizes A, B, and C must be between $1$ and $9999$ inclusive.\nThus, the prices of A, B, and C can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits.\nIf A has 1 digit, then the possible digits are 1 or 3. So A has 2 possibilities (1 or 3).\nIf A has 2 digits, then the possible digits are 11, 13, 31, 33. So A has 4 possibilities.\nIf A has 3 digits, then the possible digits are 111, 113, 131, 133, 311, 313, 331, 333. So A has 8 possibilities.\nIf A has 4 digits, then the possible digits are 1111, 1113, 1131, ..., 3333.\nThe possible combinations of the digits are combinations with repetition.\nThe total number of digits is 7.\nThe possible digits are 1 and 3.\nThe number of 1s is 4.\nThe number of 3s is 3.\nThe number of 1's is 4 and the number of 3's is 3.\nPossible lengths of prices are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item 1-digit: 2 (1, 3)\n    \\item 2-digits: 4 (11, 13, 31, 33)\n    \\item 3-digits: 8 (111, 113, 131, ..., 333)\n    \\item 4-digits: 14 (e.g., 1111, 1113, ...)\n\\end{itemize}\nThe possible numbers are (1 digit), (1 digit) (2 digit), (1 digit), (1 digit) and (2 digits) and (1 digit) (1 digit) (1 digit)\nFor A with 1 digit, A has 2 possibilities.\nFor A with 2 digits, A has 4 possibilities.\nFor A with 3 digits, A has 8 possibilities.\nFor A with 4 digits, A has 10 possibilities.\nThe prices are combinations of 1's and 3's.\nFor A = 1 digit, we have 1 or 3, so 2 choices.\nFor A = 2 digits, we have 11, 13, 31, 33, so 4 choices.\nFor A = 3 digits, we have 111, 113, 131, 133, 311, 313, 331, 333, so 8 choices.\nFor A = 4 digits, we have 10 choices.\nPossible lengths are 1, 2, 3, and 4 digits for each.\n$2 \\times 4 \\times 8 = 64$.\nTotal combinations for A, B, and C = 2 * 4 * 8 = 64\nWe have 1's and 3's.\nA can be a 1-digit or 2-digit or 3-digit or 4-digit number.\n2(1), 4(2), 8(3), 10(4) = 64 possibilities for A.\nSo, $2 \\times 4 \\times 8 = 64$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since we have three numbers, consider the number of ways we can put these three numbers together in a string of 7 digits.

We have to partition it into 3 groups with each group having at least 1 digit. In other words, we need to find the solution to\n\\[x+y+z=7, x,y,z>0.\\]\nThis gives us\n\\[\\binom{6}{2}=15\\]\nways by balls and urns. But we have counted the one with 5 digit numbers; that is, $(5,1,1),(1,1,5),(1,5,1)$.\nThus, each arrangement has\\[\\binom{6}{2}-3=12\\]ways per arrangement, and there are $12\\times35=\\boxed{420}$ ways."
