At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers from 1 to 150, inclusive, are placed in a bag and a number is randomly selected from the bag. What is the probability it is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

There are 12 perfect squares.\nThe numbers from 1 to 150 that are perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125. There are 5 perfect cubes.\nThe numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes are perfect sixth powers. These are 1, 64. There are 2 such numbers.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of perfect squares or perfect cubes is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\nThe total number of numbers from 1 to 150 is 150.\nThe number of numbers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes is $150 - 15 = 135$.\nThe probability that the selected number is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.

        "ground_truth": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$."
