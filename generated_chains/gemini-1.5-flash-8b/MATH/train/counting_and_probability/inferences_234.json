At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the probability that when we roll four fair 6-sided dice, they won't all show the same number?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice is $6^4 = 1296$.\n\n2. Number of outcomes where all four dice show the same number is 6 (1,1,1,1; 2,2,2,2; ...; 6,6,6,6).\n\n3. Number of outcomes where not all four dice show the same number is $1296 - 6 = 1290$.\n\n4. Probability that not all four dice show the same number is $\\frac{1290}{1296}$.\n\n5. Simplifying the fraction, we get $\\frac{1290}{1296} = \\frac{1290 \\div 6}{1296 \\div 6} = \\frac{215}{216}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{215}{216}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Counting the number of outcomes in which four 6-sided dice don't all show the same number would require some pretty delicate casework.  However, counting all the outcomes in which four 6-sided dice do all show the same number is very easy: there are only 6 ways this can happen, namely all ones, all twos, all threes, all fours, all fives, and all sixes.  So since there are $6^4$ total outcomes, we can conclude that $$ P(\\text{4 dice all show the same number}) = \\frac{6}{6^4} = \\frac{1}{6^3} = \\frac{1}{216}. $$Therefore, using the principle of complementary probabilities, we can conclude that $$ P(\\text{4 dice don't all show the same number}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{215}{216}}. $$"
