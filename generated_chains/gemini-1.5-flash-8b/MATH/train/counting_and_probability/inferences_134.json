        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. and Mrs. Lopez have two children.  When they get into their family car, two people sit in the front, and the other two sit in the back.  Either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must sit in the driver's seat.  How many seating arrangements are possible?",
        "inference": "1. Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez can sit in the driver's seat.  So there are 2 choices for the driver's seat.\n2. Once the driver is chosen, there are 3 remaining people to fill the remaining front seat.  So there are 3 choices.\n3. After the driver and front passenger are chosen, there are 2 remaining people to fill the back left seat.  So there are 2 choices.\n4. The final person will sit in the back right seat.  There is 1 choice left.\n5. To find the total number of seating arrangements, multiply the number of choices at each step: 2 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat. After the driver is chosen, any of the remaining three people can sit in the front, and there are two arrangements for the other two people  in the back.  Thus, there are $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 =\n\\boxed{12}$ possible seating arrangements."
