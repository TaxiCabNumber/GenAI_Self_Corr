In base 2, the first number is $11111111$, which is the only way to choose 8 1's out of 8 spaces, or $\\binom{8}{8}$. What about 9 spaces? Well, all told, there are $\\binom{9}{8}=9$, which includes the first 1. Similarly, for 10 spaces, there are $\\binom{10}{8}=45,$ which includes the first 9. For 11 spaces, there are $\\binom{11}{8}=165$, which includes the first 45. You're getting the handle. For 12 spaces, there are $\\binom{12}{8}=495$, which includes the first 165; for 13 spaces, there are $\\binom{13}{8}=13 \\cdot 99 > 1000$, so we now know that $N$ has exactly 13 spaces, so the $2^{12}$ digit is 1.\nNow we just proceed with the other 12 spaces with 7 1's, and we're looking for the $1000-495=505th$ number.
