I hope it is correct.'\nA scanning code consists of a $7 \\times 7$ grid of squares, with some of its squares colored black and the rest colored white. There must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares. A scanning code is called $\\textit{symmetric}$ if its look does not change when the entire square is rotated by a multiple of $90 ^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around its center, nor when it is reflected across a line joining opposite corners or a line joining midpoints of opposite sides. What is the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 510} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 1022} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 8190} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 8192} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 65,534}$\n",
        "inference": "1. The symmetry requirements mean the code must be symmetric under 90-degree rotations and reflections.\n2. This implies that the central square must be the same color in all directions.\n3. The 7x7 grid can be divided into 5 smaller squares. The central square and four $3\\times 3$ squares.\n4. The central square must be the same color.\n5. The 4 $3\\times 3$ squares have symmetry constraints.\n6. The corners of the $3\\times 3$ squares must be the same color.\n7. The center of the $3\\times 3$ squares must be the same color.\n8. The remaining squares in each $3\\times 3$ square have a relation in terms of symmetry.\n9. The total number of configurations possible in the $3\\times 3$ grid is $2^5 = 32$ (1 for the central and 4 for the corners).\n10. The $3\\times 3$ squares can have different configurations, but symmetry must be maintained.\n11. The 4 corners have 2 options (black or white).\n12. The center of each $3\\times 3$ square has 2 options (black or white).\n13. The remaining 4 squares in each $3\\times 3$ square must follow the symmetric pattern.\n14. Therefore, there are 2 options for the central square and 2 options for each of the 4 corners.\n15. For each $3\\times 3$ square, there are 2 options for the center and 2 options for each corner.\n16. For the 4 $3 \\times 3$ blocks, there are 2 options for the center and 2 options for each corner. So the number of possible configurations for each $3 \\times 3$ block is $2^5 = 32$.\n17. Since each $3 \\times 3$ square has 5 independent squares, the number of configurations for each $3 \\times 3$ square is $2^5 = 32$.\n18. There are 4 such $3 \\times 3$ squares, so there are $32^4 = 1048576$ possible configurations for the 4 $3\\times 3$ squares.\n19. The central square has 2 options.\n20. Thus the total number of configurations for the entire grid is $2^1 \\times 32^4 = 2 \\times 1048576 = 2097152$.\n21. The total number of possible symmetric scanning codes is $2^1 \\times (2^5)^4 = 2 \\times 32^4 = 2 \\times 1048576 = 2097152$.\n22. However, there are two reflections and four rotations, so we should divide by 8.\n23. Therefore, $2 \\times 32^4 / 8 = 2^1 \\times 32^4 / 8 = 32^4 / 4 = 1048576 / 4 = 262144$.\n24. Considering the central square, we have 2 choices (black or white).\n25. There are 2^1 choices for the center and 2^5 choices for each of the 4 corners. So 2^1 * 2^20 = 2^21 = 2,097,152.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2048}$ I hope it is correct.",
