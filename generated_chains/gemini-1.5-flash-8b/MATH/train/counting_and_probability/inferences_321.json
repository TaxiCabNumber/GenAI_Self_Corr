        "inference": "The given information is that the number of adults who drink coffee is 0.8, and the number of adults who drink tea is 0.7.  These are proportions, meaning that 80% of the adults drink coffee, and 70% drink tea.  These values are proportions and not cardinalities, so the principle of inclusion-exclusion does not apply directly.  The total number of adults must be 1 (or 100%).\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible value for the proportion of adults who drink both coffee and tea.  Let $x$ be the proportion of adults who drink both coffee and tea.  Then the proportion of adults who drink coffee or tea is given by $|C \\cup T| = |C| + |T| - |C \\cap T| = 0.8 + 0.7 - x = 1.5 - x$.\n\nSince the total proportion of adults is 1, the proportion of adults who drink coffee or tea cannot exceed 1.  That is,\n$$ |C \\cup T| \\le 1 $$\n$$ 1.5 - x \\le 1 $$\n$$ x \\ge 1.5 - 1 $$\n$$ x \\ge 0.5 $$\nTherefore, the smallest possible proportion of adults who drink both coffee and tea is 0.5 or 50%.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$",
