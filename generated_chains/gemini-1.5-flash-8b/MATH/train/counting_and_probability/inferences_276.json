At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
        "inference": "1. The probability of rolling an even number on a 12-sided die is 6/12 = 1/2.\n2. The probability of rolling an odd number is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n3. We want exactly two dice to show an even number. This means 3 dice show an odd number.\n4. The number of ways to choose which 2 dice show an even number from 5 dice is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n5. The probability of getting 2 even numbers and 3 odd numbers is $\\binom{5}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^3 = 10 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^5 = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{10}{32} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$."
