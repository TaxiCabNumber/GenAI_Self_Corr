At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes?",
        "inference": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of boxes. Since there are 4 balls, the number of ways to put the 4 balls into 2 boxes is $2^4 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes."
