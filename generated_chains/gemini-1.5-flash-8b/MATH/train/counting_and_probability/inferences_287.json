At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose 1 triplet out of 3. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways.\n\n2. After choosing 1 triplet, we need to choose the remaining $6 - 1 = 5$ starters from the remaining $14 - 3 = 11$ players. This can be done in $\\binom{11}{5}$ ways.\n\n3. Multiply the number of ways to choose the triplet by the number of ways to choose the remaining players: $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times \\frac{11!}{5!6!} = 3 \\times \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 3 \\times 462 = 1386$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1386}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$."

Choose the remaining 4 players from the remaining $14 - 3 = 11$ players: This can be done in $\\binom{11}{4} = \\frac{11!}{4!7!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 11 \\times 10 \\times 3 = 330$ ways.\n\n\n3.
