At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the coefficient of $x^4$ in the expansion of $(1-2x^2)^5$?",

This means we need $2k = 4$, so $k = 2$.\nThe term with $x^4$ is\n$$ \\binom{5}{2} (-2)^2 x^4 = \\binom{5}{2} (4) x^4 = 10(4)x^4 = 40x^4 $$\nThe coefficient of $x^4$ is 40.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
