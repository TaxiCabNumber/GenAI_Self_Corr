        "ground_truth": "We can solve this by finding all the combinations, then subtracting the ones that are on the same line. There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$, so $\\dbinom{25}3$ is $\\frac{25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $2300$. Now we count the ones that are on the same line. We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\\dbinom53$ is $10$, and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$. We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal. That is $\\dbinom43$, which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$. We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$. We can also count the ones with a slope of $\\frac12$, $2$, $-\\frac12$, or $-2$, with $3$ points in each. There are $12$ of them, so that results in $12$.
