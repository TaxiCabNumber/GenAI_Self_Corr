At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nErika, who is 14 years old, flips a fair coin whose sides are labeled 10 and 20, and then she adds the number on the top of the flipped coin to the number she rolls on a standard die. What is the probability that the sum equals her age in years? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "1. Erika's age is 14.\n2. The coin can show 10 or 20.\n3. The die can show 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n4. We need to find the combinations of coin and die results that add up to 14.\n5. If the coin shows 10, then we need 10 + die = 14, which means the die must show 4.\n6. If the coin shows 20, then we need 20 + die = 14, which is impossible.\n7. The only combination that works is coin = 10, die = 4.\n8. There are 2 possible outcomes for the coin flip (10 or 20) and 6 possible outcomes for the die roll (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n9. The total number of possible outcomes is 2 * 6 = 12.\n10. The favorable outcome is coin = 10, die = 4.\n11. The probability is 1/12.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The only way for the sum to be a 14 is for her coin flip to be a 10 and for her roll to be a 4. This can only occur in $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
