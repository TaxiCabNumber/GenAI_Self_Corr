        "inference": "Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. The number 43 appears in the rows where $nCk = 43$ for some $n$ and $k$.\nThe binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$ are given by the formula\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nThe values of $\\binom{n}{k}$ for $n = 1, 2, \\dots$ and $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n$ form Pascal's Triangle.\nThe number 43 appears in the rows where $\\binom{n}{k} = 43$ for some $n$ and $k$.\nSince $43$ is prime, the only possible pairs $(k, n-k)$ are $(1, 42)$ or $(42, 1)$, which corresponds to $(k,n) = (1,43)$ and $(42,43)$.\nThe binomial coefficients are symmetric, so $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$.\nWe need to find $n$ and $k$ such that $\\binom{n}{k} = 43$. Since 43 is a prime number, by Lucas's theorem, the only possible solutions are\n$\\binom{n}{k} = 43$ if $n=43$ and $k = 1$ or $k = 42$.\nIf $n=43$ and $k=1$, then $\\binom{43}{1} = \\frac{43!}{1!

(43-42)!} = \\frac{43!}{42! 1!} = 43$.\nSo the number 43 appears in the 43rd row.\nThe rows are indexed from 0. The 43rd row is the row where $n=43$, which is $n=42+1$.\nThere are two occurrences of 43 in the row indexed by 42, i.e., $n=43$.\nThus, there are 2 rows containing 43.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$",
        "ground_truth": "$43$ appears in the $43$rd row of Pascal's Triangle, since $\\binom{43}{1} = 43$. Note that $43$ is prime, so the smallest integer $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $43$ is actually $43$. Therefore, the $43$rd row is the first row in which $43$ appears. Also note that all the other numbers in the $43$rd row are greater than $43$, with the exception of the $1$'s on the ends. As a result, all the numbers on the following rows will either be $1$ or greater than $43$, so $43$ only appears in the $43$rd row.
