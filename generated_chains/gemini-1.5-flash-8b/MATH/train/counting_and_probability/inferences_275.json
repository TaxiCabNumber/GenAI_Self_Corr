At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Ways for the two students who refuse to stand next to each other to stand next to each other: Consider them as a single entity.  There are 3 entities (the pair and the other two students).  This can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. However, the two students within the pair can swap places, giving another 2 ways. So there are 6 * 2 = 12 ways where the two students stand together.\n3. Ways the two students do not stand together: Total ways - ways they stand together = 24 - 12 = 12 ways.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways."
