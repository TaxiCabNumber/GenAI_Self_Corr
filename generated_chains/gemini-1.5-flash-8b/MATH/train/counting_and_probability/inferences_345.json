At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a press conference before the All-Star Game, eight All-Stars will be taking questions. Three are Cubs, three are Red Sox, and two are Yankees. If teammates insist on sitting together, how many ways can the eight All-Stars be seated in a row?",

Within the Yankees block, there are 2! ways to arrange the 2 Yankees.\n5. Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks together by the number of ways to arrange the players within each block: 3! * 3! * 2! * 3! * 3! = 6 * 6 * 2 * 6 * 6 = 2592.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2592}$\n",
