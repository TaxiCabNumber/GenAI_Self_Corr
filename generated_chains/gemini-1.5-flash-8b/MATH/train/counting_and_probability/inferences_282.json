At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRobert likes chocolate milk, so he decides to visit the milk bottling plant every day for a week to get the free samples. Unfortunately for him, the bottling plant sometimes bottles regular milk instead of chocolate milk, so each day the plant has a 2/3 chance of bottling chocolate milk. What is the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days he visits?",
        "inference": "Let X be the number of days the plant bottles chocolate milk.\nWe have 5 days of visits, and the probability of bottling chocolate milk on each day is 2/3.\nThis is a binomial distribution with n=5 trials and probability of success p = 2/3.\nWe want to find the probability that the plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days, which means X = 4.\nThe binomial probability formula is given by:\nP(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\nIn this case, n = 5, k = 4, and p = 2/3.\nP(X=4) = (5 choose 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1 - 2/3)^(5-4)\nP(X=4) = (5 choose 4) * (2/3)^4 * (1/3)^1\nP(X=4) = 5 * (16/81) * (1/3)\nP(X=4) = 5 * (16/243)\nP(X=4) = 80/243\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways to choose which 4 of the 5 days the plant will bottle chocolate milk. For each choice, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1$ that on those 4 days they will be bottling chocolate milk and on the other day they will not. Therefore, the total probability on that exactly 4 of the 5 days they will be bottling chocolate milk is $5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1 = \\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}$."
