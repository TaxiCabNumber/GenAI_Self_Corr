At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can we put 3 math books and 5 English books on a shelf if all the math books must stay together and all the English books must also stay together?  (The math books are all different and so are the English books.)",
        "inference": "1. Treat the 3 math books as a single unit and the 5 English books as a single unit.  We have 2 units to arrange.\n2. The number of ways to arrange 2 units is 2!.  This is 2 * 1 = 2.\n3. Within the math unit, the 3 math books can be arranged in 3! ways.  This is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\n4. Within the English unit, the 5 English books can be arranged in 5! ways.  This is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n5. To find the total number of ways, multiply the number of ways to arrange the units (2!), the number of ways to arrange the math books (3!), and the number of ways to arrange the English books (5!).  So, we have 2! * 3! * 5! = 2 * 6 * 120 = 1440.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1440}$\n",
