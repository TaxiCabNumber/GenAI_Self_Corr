At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the $2001$ students at a high school studies either Spanish or French, and some study both. The number who study Spanish is between $80$ percent and $85$ percent of the school population, and the number who study French is between $30$ percent and $40$ percent. Let $m$ be the smallest number of students who could study both languages, and let $M$ be the largest number of students who could study both languages. Find $M-m$.\n",
