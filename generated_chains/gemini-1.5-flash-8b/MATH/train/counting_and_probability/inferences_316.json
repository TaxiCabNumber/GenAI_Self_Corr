        "ground_truth": "Each letter in the word PROBLEM appears exactly once among the words CAMP, HERBS, and GLOW.

Also, he must select the letters E, R, and B when choosing four letters from the word HERBS.  Among the $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain all of the letters E, R, and B.  Therefore, the probability that he will select E, R, and B from HERBS is 2/5.
