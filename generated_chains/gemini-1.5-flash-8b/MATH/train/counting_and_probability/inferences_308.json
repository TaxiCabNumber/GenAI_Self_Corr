At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if each member sits next to two members of the other party? (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "First, we need to arrange the Democrats and Republicans alternately around the circular table.\nThere are 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.\nSince the order matters, we have 5! ways to arrange the Democrats.\nSimilarly, we have 5! ways to arrange the Republicans.\nThe total number of ways to arrange the Democrats and Republicans alternately is 5! * 5!. However, we are considering circular arrangements, so we must divide by 10 to account for rotations.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans alternately around a circular table is $\\frac{5! \\times 5!}{10} = \\frac{120 \\times 120}{10} = 120 \\times 12 = 1440$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1440}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The only way that the Senators can be seated is if the seats alternate by party.  Fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat, so that we have removed the overcounting of rotations of the same arrangement.  Now there are $4!$ ways to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in the Republican seats, for a total of $5! \\times 4! = \\boxed{2,\\!880}$ arrangements."
