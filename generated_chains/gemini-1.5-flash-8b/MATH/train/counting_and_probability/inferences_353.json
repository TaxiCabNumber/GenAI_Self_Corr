At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bored student walks down a hall that contains a row of closed lockers, numbered $1$ to $1024$. He opens the locker numbered 1, and then alternates between skipping and opening each locker thereafter. When he reaches the end of the hall, the student turns around and starts back. He opens the first closed locker he encounters, and then alternates between skipping and opening each closed locker thereafter. The student continues wandering back and forth in this manner until every locker is open. What is the number of the last locker he opens?\n",
        "inference": "1. The student opens locker 1.\n2. He skips locker 2 and opens locker 3. Skips 4, opens 5, etc. This means he opens all odd numbers.\n3. He turns around and opens locker 2. Skips 3, opens 4, skips 5, opens 6, etc. He opens all lockers that are multiples of 2.\n4. The pattern is to open lockers that have an odd number of factors.\n5. The student opens locker 1. The lockers that he opened in the first pass have only one factor.\n6. The lockers opened in the second pass are multiples of 2.\n7. The lockers opened in the third pass are multiples of 3.\n8. In general, the lockers opened are multiples of $n$ if they have an odd number of factors.\n9. The lockers that have an odd number of factors are perfect squares.\n10. We need to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to 1024.\n11. $32^2 = 1024$.\n12. The last locker opened is $32^2 = 1024$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1024}$",
        "ground_truth": "On his first pass, he opens all of the odd lockers. So there are only even lockers closed. Then he opens the lockers that are multiples of $4$, leaving only lockers $2 \\pmod{8}$ and $6 \\pmod{8}$. Then he goes ahead and opens all lockers $2 \\pmod {8}$, leaving lockers either $6 \\pmod {16}$ or $14 \\pmod {16}$. He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $14 \\pmod {16}$, leaving the lockers either $6 \\pmod {32}$ or $22 \\pmod {32}$. He then goes ahead and opens all lockers $6 \\pmod {32}$, leaving $22 \\pmod {64}$ or $54 \\pmod {64}$. He then opens $54 \\pmod {64}$, leaving $22 \\pmod {128}$ or $86 \\pmod {128}$. He then opens $22 \\pmod {128}$ and leaves $86 \\pmod {256}$ and $214 \\pmod {256}$. He then opens all $214 \\pmod {256}$, so we have $86 \\pmod {512}$ and $342 \\pmod {512}$, leaving lockers $86, 342, 598$, and $854$, and he is at where he started again. He then opens $86$ and $598$, and then goes back and opens locker number $854$, leaving locker number $\\boxed{342}$ untouched. He opens that locker."
