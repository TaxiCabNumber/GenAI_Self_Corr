At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery card in a deck has a picture of one shape - circle, square, or triangle, which is painted in one of the three colors - red, blue, or green. Furthermore, each color is applied in one of three shades - light, medium, or dark. The deck has 27 cards, with every shape-color-shade combination represented. A set of three cards from the deck is called complementary if all of the following statements are true:\ni. Either each of the three cards has a different shape or all three of the card have the same shape.\nii. Either each of the three cards has a different color or all three of the cards have the same color.\niii. Either each of the three cards has a different shade or all three of the cards have the same shade.\nHow many different complementary three-card sets are there?\n",
