        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a set of 1000 switches, each of which has four positions, called $A, B, C$, and $D$. When the position of any switch changes, it is only from $A$ to $B$, from $B$ to $C$, from $C$ to $D$, or from $D$ to $A$. Initially each switch is in position $A$. The switches are labeled with the 1000 different integers $(2^{x})(3^{y})(5^{z})$, where $x, y$, and $z$ take on the values $0, 1, \\ldots, 9$. At step i of a 1000-step process, the $i$-th switch is advanced one step, and so are all the other switches whose labels divide the label on the $i$-th switch. After step 1000 has been completed, how many switches will be in position $A$?\n",

The switches with labels dividing $n$ are those with labels of the form $m = (2^{x'}) (3^{y'}) (5^{z'})$ where $x' \\le x, y' \\le y, z' \\le z$.\nFor each switch $i$, let $n_i$ be the label of the switch. At step $i$, the switch $i$ is advanced. Switches with labels that are factors of $n_i$ are advanced.\nIf a switch is advanced $k$ times, then the position of the switch changes from $A$ to $B$, $B$ to $C$, $C$ to $D$, $D$ to $A$.
