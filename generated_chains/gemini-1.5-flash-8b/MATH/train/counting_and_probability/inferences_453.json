At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLicense plates from different states follow different alpha-numeric formats, which dictate which characters of a plate must be letters and which must be numbers. Florida has license plates with an alpha-numeric format like the one pictured. North Dakota, on the other hand, has a different format, also pictured. Assuming all 10 digits are equally likely to appear in the numeric positions, and all 26 letters are equally likely to appear in the alpha positions, how many more license plates can Florida issue than North Dakota?

        "ground_truth": "Florida issues license plates in which the first three and last slots are filled with letters, and the fourth and fifth are filled with digits.
