Each person may be a member of any number of $5$-player teams, but no two teams may have exactly the same $5$ members. The site statistics show a curious fact: The average, over all subsets of size $9$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $9$ people is equal to the reciprocal of the average, over all subsets of size $8$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $8$ people. How many values $n$, $9\\leq n\\leq 2017$, can be the number of participants?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 477 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 482 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 487 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 557 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 562$\n",
