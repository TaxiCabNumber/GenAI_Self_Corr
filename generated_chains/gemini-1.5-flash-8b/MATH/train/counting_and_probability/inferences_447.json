Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
        "inference": "Let $a_n$ be the number of ways the paperboy can deliver newspapers to $n$ houses such that he never misses three consecutive houses.\nFor $n=1$, there are 2 ways: deliver to house 1 or not deliver. $a_1=2$\nFor $n=2$, there are 4 ways: deliver to house 1, deliver to house 2, deliver to both houses, or deliver to neither house. $a_2=4$\nFor $n=3$, there are 7 ways: $a_3 = 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6$ (the only restriction is that we cannot deliver to 3 consecutive houses).  The possible ways are DDD, DDN, DND, DNN, NDD, NDN, NNN, so there are 7 ways.\nFor $n=4$, the possibilities are: \nIf $a_n$ is the number of ways for n houses, and the last delivery is at house $i$, then $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}$ with $a_1=2, a_2=4, a_3=7$.\n$a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 7+4+2 = 13$\n$a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2 = 13+7+4 = 24$\n$a_6 = a_5 + a_4 + a_3 = 24+13+7 = 44$\n$a_7 = a_6 + a_5 + a_4 = 44+24+13 = 81$\n$a_8 = a_7 + a_6 + a_5 = 81+44+24 = 149$\n$a_9 = a_8 + a_7 + a_6 = 149+81+44 = 274$\n$a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 + a_7 = 274 + 149 + 81 = 504$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{504}$",
        "ground_truth": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$.
