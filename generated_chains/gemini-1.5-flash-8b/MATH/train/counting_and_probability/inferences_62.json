At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",

Two characters must be the same.\n   Case 1: First and middle are the same.\n      First character is a letter, so there are 26 choices.\n      Middle character must be the same letter, so there is 1 choice.\n      Last character is a digit, so there are 10 choices.\n      Number of ways: 26 * 1 * 10 = 260\n   Case 2: First and last are the same.\n      First character is a letter, so there are 26 choices.\n      Middle character can be a letter or a digit, so there are 36 choices.\n      Last character must be the same letter as the first character, so there is 1 choice.\n      Number of ways: 26 * 36 * 1 = 936\n   Case 3: Middle and last are the same.\n      First character is a letter, so there are 26 choices.\n      Middle character is a digit, so there are 10 choices.\n      Last character must be the same digit as the middle character, so there is 1 choice.\n      Number of ways: 26 * 10 * 1 = 260\n5.
