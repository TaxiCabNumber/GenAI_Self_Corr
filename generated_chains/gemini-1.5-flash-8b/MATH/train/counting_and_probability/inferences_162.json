At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have 3 boys and 3 girls?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose 3 boys from 6 boys. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n2. We need to choose 3 girls from 8 girls. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\n3. To find the total number of ways to select the team with 3 boys and 3 girls, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls: $20 \\times 56 = 1120$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1120}$\n",
