At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix green balls and four red balls are in a bag.  A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?",

Probability of drawing a green ball on the second draw, given a green ball was drawn on the first draw: 6/10\n3. Probability of drawing two green balls: (6/10) * (6/10) = 36/100\n\n4. Probability of drawing a red ball on the first draw: 4/10\n5. Probability of drawing a red ball on the second draw, given a red ball was drawn on the first draw: 4/10\n6. Probability of drawing two red balls: (4/10) * (4/10) = 16/100\n\n7. Probability of drawing two balls of the same color: (Probability of two green balls) + (Probability of two red balls) = 36/100 + 16/100 = 52/100\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.52}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{4}{25}$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{9}{25} + \\dfrac{4}{25} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$."
