        "inference": "1. Calculate the total number of outcomes for each die: 20 sides.\n2. Calculate the number of outcomes for each color on each die:\n   - Maroon: 4\n   - Teal: 7\n   - Cyan: 8\n   - Sparkly: 1\n3. Calculate the probability of rolling a specific color on one die:\n   - Maroon: 4/20 = 1/5\n   - Teal: 7/20\n   - Cyan: 8/20 = 2/5\n   - Sparkly: 1/20\n4. To find the probability of rolling the same color on both dice, we need to multiply the probability of rolling that color on the first die by the probability of rolling the same color on the second die.\n5. Probability of rolling Maroon on both dice: (1/5) * (1/5) = 1/25\n6. Probability of rolling Teal on both dice: (7/20) * (7/20) = 49/400\n7. Probability of rolling Cyan on both dice: (2/5) * (2/5) = 4/25\n8. Probability of rolling Sparkly on both dice: (1/20) * (1/20) = 1/400\n9. Sum the probabilities of rolling the same color on both dice:\n   (1/25) + (49/400) + (4/25) + (1/400) = (16/400) + (49/400) + (64/400) + (1/400) = 130/400\n10. Simplify the fraction: 130/400 = 13/40\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13/40}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$."
