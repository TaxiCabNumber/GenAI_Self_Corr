This means we want to find the probability of getting exactly 8 heads, exactly 9 heads, or exactly 10 heads.\nThe number of ways to get exactly k heads in 10 flips is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{10}{k}$.  The probability of getting exactly k heads is $\\binom{10}{k} (1/2)^k (1/2)^{10-k} = \\binom{10}{k} (1/2)^{10}$.\nSo, the probability of getting exactly 8 heads is $\\binom{10}{8} (1/2)^{10} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} (1/2)^{10} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} \\times (1/2)^{10} = 45 (1/2)^{10}$.\nThe probability of getting exactly 9 heads is $\\binom{10}{9} (1/2)^{10} = \\frac{10!}{9!1!} (1/2)^{10} = 10 (1/2)^{10}$.\nThe probability of getting exactly 10 heads is $\\binom{10}{10} (1/2)^{10} = 1 (1/2)^{10}$.\nThe probability of getting at least 8 heads is the sum of these probabilities:\n$45 (1/2)^{10} + 10 (1/2)^{10} + 1 (1/2)^{10} = (45+10+1)(1/2)^{10} = 56 (1/2)^{10} = 56/1024 = 7/128$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7/128}$.
