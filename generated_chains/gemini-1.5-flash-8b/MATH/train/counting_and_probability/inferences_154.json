        "inference": "The problem asks for the coefficient of the $x^2y^4$ term in the expansion of $(x+y)^6$.  Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by $\\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$.\nIn this case, $n=6$, and we want the term with $x^2y^4$, so we need $n-k = 2$ and $k = 4$.\nThus, the coefficient is $\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$",
