At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1 to 20. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
        "inference": "Let $X$ be the number of even numbers rolled.\nThere are 10 even numbers from 1 to 20, and 10 odd numbers.\nThe probability of rolling an even number is $\\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe want to find the probability that exactly two of the four dice show an even number. This is a binomial probability problem.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 dice to show an even number from 4 dice is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\nThe probability of getting an even number on a single die is $p = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of getting an odd number on a single die is $q = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of getting exactly 2 even numbers in 4 rolls is given by the binomial probability formula:\n$$P(X=2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 6 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 6 \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$ I hope it is correct.",
