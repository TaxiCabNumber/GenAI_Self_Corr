Three-digit numbers without 7 or 9:  We need to find the count of three-digit numbers that do not contain the digits 7 or 9.  There are 8 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) for each digit.  \n   - First digit: 8 choices (cannot be 0)\n   - Second digit: 8 choices\n   - Third digit: 8 choices\n   So, there are 8 * 8 * 8 = 512 three-digit numbers without 7 or 9.\n\n3. Three-digit numbers with at least one 7 or at least one 9:  This is the complement of the numbers without 7 or 9.  So, the count is the total three-digit numbers minus the count of numbers without 7 or 9.\n   900 - 512 = 388\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{388}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$."
