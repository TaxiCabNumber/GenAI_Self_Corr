        "inference": "The point is closer to 4 than to 0 if the distance from the point to 4 is less than the distance from the point to 0.  This means $|x-4| < |x|$.  Squaring both sides, we get $(x-4)^2 < x^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 8x + 16 < x^2$.  Then $-8x < -16$, so $x > 2$.\n\nSince the number line is from 0 to 5, the points $x$ that satisfy the condition are those in the interval $(2, 5]$.  The total length of the interval is 5. The length of the interval we want is $5-2 = 3$.  The probability is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n$\\boxed{0.6}$\n",
