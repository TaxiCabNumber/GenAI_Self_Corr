At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
        "inference": "1. First, consider the number of ways to arrange the 3 types of animals.  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange chickens, dogs, and cats.\n\n2. Now, consider the 4 chickens. There are 4! ways to arrange them.\n\n3. Consider the 2 dogs. There are 2! ways to arrange them.\n\n4. Consider the 5 cats. There are 5! ways to arrange them.\n\n5. Multiply the number of arrangements for each type of animal.  This gives 3! * 4! * 2! * 5! = 6 * 24 * 2 * 120 = 34560\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34560}$\n",

There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats.
