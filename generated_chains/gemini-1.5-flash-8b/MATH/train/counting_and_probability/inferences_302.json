        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose I have a bag with 12 slips of paper in it.  Some of the slips have a 2 on them, and the rest have a 7 on them.  If the expected value of the number shown on a slip randomly drawn from the bag is $3.25$, then how many slips have a 2?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of slips with a 2 on them.\nLet $y$ be the number of slips with a 7 on them.\nThe total number of slips is 12, so $x+y=12$.\nThe expected value is given by the formula:\nExpected value = $\\frac{\\text{sum of values}}{\\text{total number of slips}}$\nIn this case, the sum of values is $2x + 7y$.\nThe expected value is $3.25$.\nSo, $\\frac{2x + 7y}{12} = 3.25$.\nWe have $2x + 7y = 3.25 \\times 12 = 39$.\nWe also have $y = 12 - x$.\nSubstituting $y$ into the equation, we get:\n$2x + 7(12-x) = 39$\n$2x + 84 - 7x = 39$\n$-5x = 39 - 84$\n$-5x = -45$\n$x = \\frac{-45}{-5}$\n$x = 9$\nSo there are 9 slips with a 2 on them.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We let $x$ denote the number of slips with a 2 written on them.  (This is the usual tactic of letting a variable denote what we're trying to solve for in the problem.)  Then there are $12-x$ slips with a 7 on them. The probability of drawing a 2 is $\\frac{x}{12}$ and the probability of drawing a 7 is $\\frac{12-x}{12}$, so the expected value of the number drawn is $$ E = \\frac{x}{12}(2) + \\frac{12-x}{12}(7) = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$But we are given that $E=3.25$, so we have the equation $$ 3.25 = \\frac{84-5x}{12}. $$This simplifies to $39 = 84 - 5x$, which means that $x = 9$. Thus $\\boxed{9}$ of the 12 slips have a 2 written on them."
