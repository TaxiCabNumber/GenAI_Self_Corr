        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA library has six identical copies of a certain book. At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of identical books in the library. In this case, $n = 6$.\nWe want to find the number of ways to have some books in the library and some checked out.\nThe total number of ways to distribute the books between the library and checked out is $2^6$ (each book can be either in the library or checked out).\nHowever, we are given that at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out.\nThis means we cannot have all books in the library or all books checked out.\nThe number of ways to have all books in the library is 1, and the number of ways to have all books checked out is 1.\nSo, the number of ways to have some books in the library and some checked out is $2^6 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62$.\nTherefore, there are 62 ways for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{62}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities."
