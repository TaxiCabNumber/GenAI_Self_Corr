        "inference": "The total number of three-digit integers with a ones digit of 3 is 90.\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\nWe are looking for integers of the form 100a + 10b + 3, where a and b are digits from 0 to 9 and a \u2260 0.\nThe sum of the digits is a + b + 3.  We need a + b + 3 to be divisible by 3.\nThis means a + b must be 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15.\nThe possible values for a + b are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\nWe need to count the number of possible pairs (a, b) for each case.\n\nFor a + b = 3, a can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
