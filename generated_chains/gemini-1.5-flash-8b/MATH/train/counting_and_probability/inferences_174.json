At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
        "inference": "To form a rectangle, we need to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines.\nThere are 4 horizontal lines, so the number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\nThere are 4 vertical lines, so the number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines is the product of the number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines and the number of ways to choose 2 vertical lines.\nThus, the number of ways to form a rectangle is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle."
