Terry picks two candies at random, then Mary picks two of the remaining candies at random.

        "ground_truth": "The probability that Terry picks two red candies is $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{20 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{9}{38}$, and the probability that Mary picks two red candies after Terry chooses two red candies is $\\frac{7\\cdot8}{18\\cdot17} = \\frac{28}{153}$.

We could also solve the problem using unordered choices. The probabilities calculated will all be the same, but the calculations will appear somewhat different. For instance, the probability that Mary chooses two red candies after Terry chose two red candies will have the form $\\frac{{8\\choose 2}}{{18 \\choose 2}}$, and the probability that Terry chooses two different candies will have the form $\\frac{{10\\choose 1}\\cdot{10\\choose 1}}{{20\\choose2}}$. It is not difficult to see that these yield the same results as our calculations above, as we would expect."
