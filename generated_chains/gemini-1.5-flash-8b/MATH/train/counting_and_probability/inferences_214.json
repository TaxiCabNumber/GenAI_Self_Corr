At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of the same gender?  Assume no one can hold both offices.",
        "inference": "1. To choose a president and a vice-president of the same gender, we must first decide whether the president and vice-president will be boys or girls.\n2. If the president and vice-president are boys, there are 10 choices for the president and 9 choices for the vice-president (since no one can hold both offices). Thus, there are 10 * 9 = 90 ways to choose a boy president and a boy vice-president.\n3. If the president and vice-president are girls, there are 10 choices for the president and 9 choices for the vice-president. Thus, there are 10 * 9 = 90 ways to choose a girl president and a girl vice-president.\n4. To find the total number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president of the same gender, we add the number of ways for boys and girls.\n5. Total ways = 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 9 remaining members of the same sex. The answer is $20\\times 9=\\boxed{180}$."
