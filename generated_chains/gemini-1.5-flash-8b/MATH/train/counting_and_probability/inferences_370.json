The largest possible sum of two sides is $a_{10} + a_{9} = 2a_{10} - 1$.\nThe triangle inequality implies that the largest side must be smaller than the sum of the other two sides. For a triangle inequality to hold for any three sides $a_i, a_j, a_k$, we need $a_i + a_j > a_k$ for $a_k$ as the largest side, $a_i + a_k > a_j$ and $a_j + a_k > a_i$.\nIf we have consecutive integers, the smallest 3 values are $4, 5, 6$, which satisfy $4 + 5 > 6$, $4 + 6 > 5$, and $5 + 6 > 4$.\nThe largest 3 values in a set of 10 consecutive integers are $n-9, n-8, n-7$. We need $n-9 + n-8 > n-7 \\implies 2n - 17 > n-7 \\implies n > 10$.\nThus, for the 10 consecutive integers $\\{n-9, n-8, \\dots, n\\}$, the largest three sides are $n-2, n-1, n$.\nThe triangle inequality is $n - 2 + n - 1 > n$, or $2n - 3 > n$, which gives $n > 3$.\nThe smallest set of 10 elements from consecutive integers is $\\{4, 5, \\dots, 13\\}$, and we want the largest $n$ such that any 10 element subset has the triangle property.\nFor $n=10$, the maximum values are $10, 11, 12, \\dots$. The set $\\{4, 5, \\dots, 13\\}$ contains 10 values.\nWe need any three sides from these 10 values to form a triangle. The largest 3 elements can't form a triangle if the triangle inequality fails.
