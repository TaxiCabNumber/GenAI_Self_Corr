Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers.
