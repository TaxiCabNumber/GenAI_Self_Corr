At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cubes with the faces numbered 1 through 6 are tossed and the numbers shown on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Three are one parity, and three are the other parity, so no matter what the first cube shows, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac12}$ chance that the sum is either parity.
