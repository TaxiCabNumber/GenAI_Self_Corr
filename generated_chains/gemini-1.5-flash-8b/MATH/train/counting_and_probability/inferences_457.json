At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 5 distinct digits, there would be $5! = 120$ orderings. However, we must divide by 3! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in that many ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{5!}{3!\\cdot 2!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = \\boxed{10}$."
