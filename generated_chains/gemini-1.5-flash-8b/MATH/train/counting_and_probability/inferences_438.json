At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA child has a set of 96 distinct blocks. Each block is one of 2 materials (plastic, wood), 3 sizes (small, medium, large), 4 colors (blue, green, red, yellow), and 4 shapes (circle, hexagon, square, triangle). How many blocks in the set differ from the 'plastic medium red circle' in exactly 2 ways? (The 'wood medium red square' is such a block)\n(A) 29 (B) 39 (C) 48 (D) 56 (E) 62\n",
        "inference": "The 'plastic medium red circle' block has 4 characteristics: material (plastic), size (medium), color (red), shape (circle).\nWe need to find blocks that differ from this block in exactly 2 ways.\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 characteristics to change is $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\nCase 1: Change material and size.\nMaterial has 1 choice (wood) and size has 2 choices (small, large).  So we have 2 choices (wood small, wood large).\nColor and shape remain the same.  This gives 2 blocks.\n\nCase 2: Change material and color.\nMaterial has 1 choice (wood).  Color has 3 choices (green, yellow, blue).  So we have 3 choices. Shape remains the same. This gives 3 blocks.\n\nCase 3: Change material and shape.\nMaterial has 1 choice (wood). Shape has 3 choices (hexagon, square, triangle). So we have 3 choices. Color remains the same. This gives 3 blocks.\n\nCase 4: Change size and color.\nSize has 2 choices (small, large). Color has 3 choices (green, yellow, blue).  So we have 6 choices. Material and shape remain the same. This gives 6 blocks.\n\nCase 5: Change size and shape.\nSize has 2 choices (small, large). Shape has 3 choices (hexagon, square, triangle).  So we have 6 choices. Material and color remain the same. This gives 6 blocks.\n\nCase 6: Change color and shape.\nColor has 3 choices (green, yellow, blue). Shape has 3 choices (hexagon, square, triangle).  So we have 9 choices. Material and size remain the same. This gives 9 blocks.\n\nTotal number of blocks that differ in exactly 2 ways is $2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 30$\n\nHowever, the number of choices for each case must include the original choice. So for case 1, we have 2 choices. For case 2, we have 3 choices.  For case 3, we have 3 choices. For case 4, we have 6 choices. For case 5, we have 6 choices. For case 6, we have 9 choices.\nThus, the total number of blocks that differ from 'plastic medium red circle' in exactly 2 ways is $2 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 30 - 2$.  We need to subtract 2 because we have double counted these cases. This should be $2+3+3+6+6+9=30$\n\n$2+3+3+6+6+9=29$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29}$",
        "ground_truth": "The process of choosing a block can be represented by a generating function. Each choice we make can match the 'plastic medium red circle' in one of its qualities $(1)$ or differ from it in $k$ different ways $(kx)$. Choosing the material is represented by the factor $(1+1x)$, choosing the size by the factor $(1+2x)$, etc:\\[(1+x)(1+2x)(1+3x)^2\\]Expanding out the first two factors and the square:\\[(1+3x+2x^2)(1+6x+9x^2)\\]By expanding further we can find the coefficient of $x^2$, which represents the number of blocks differing from the original block in exactly two ways. We don't have to expand it completely, but choose the terms which will be multiplied together to result in a constant multiple of $x^2$:\\[1\\cdot9+3\\cdot6+2\\cdot1=\\boxed{29}\\]"
