At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
        "inference": "1. Total plates: 5+2+2+1 = 10 plates.\n2. Total arrangements around a circular table of n objects is (n-1)!\n3. Total arrangements of all 10 plates: (10-1)! = 9!\n4. Arrangements where the 2 green plates are together: Treat the 2 green plates as a single object. Then there are 9 objects to arrange, which is (9-1)! = 8!.  However, the 2 green plates can be arranged in 2! ways, so we multiply by 2!: 8! * 2!\n5. Arrangements with green plates together: 8! * 2! = 40320 * 2 = 80640\n6. Arrangements where the green plates are not together: Total arrangements - arrangements with green plates together = 9! - (8! * 2!) = 362880 - 80640 = 282240\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{282240}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$."
