Alice, Bob, and Charlie each want to buy a pet. For variety, they each want a different kind of pet. How many ways can Alice, Bob, and Charlie buy pets and leave the store satisfied?",
        "inference": "1. Alice can choose a puppy, kitten, or hamster.  There are 15 choices for a puppy, 6 choices for a kitten, and 8 choices for a hamster.  So there are 15+6+8=29 possible choices for Alice.\n\n2. Bob must choose a different kind of pet than Alice.  If Alice chose a puppy, Bob can choose a kitten or a hamster.  If Alice chose a kitten, Bob can choose a puppy or a hamster.  If Alice chose a hamster, Bob can choose a puppy or a kitten.  Therefore, there are 14 choices if Alice chose a puppy (6 kittens + 8 hamsters).  There are 5 choices if Alice chose a kitten (15 puppies + 8 hamsters).  There are 7 choices if Alice chose a hamster (15 puppies + 6 kittens).  This is a total of 14 + 5 + 7 = 26 possible choices for Bob.\n\n\n3. Charlie must choose a different kind of pet than Alice and Bob.  \n   * If Alice chose a puppy and Bob chose a kitten, Charlie can choose a hamster (8 choices).\n   * If Alice chose a puppy and Bob chose a hamster, Charlie can choose a kitten (6 choices).\n   * If Alice chose a kitten and Bob chose a puppy, Charlie can choose a hamster (8 choices).\n   * If Alice chose a kitten and Bob chose a hamster, Charlie can choose a puppy (15 choices).\n   * If Alice chose a hamster and Bob chose a puppy, Charlie can choose a kitten (6 choices).\n   * If Alice chose a hamster and Bob chose a kitten, Charlie can choose a puppy (15 choices).\n\nSo if Alice chose a puppy there are $6 \\times 8 = 48$ ways for Bob and Charlie to choose. If Alice chose a kitten there are $15 \\times 8 = 120$ ways for Bob and Charlie to choose. If Alice chose a hamster there are $15 \\times 6 = 90$ ways for Bob and Charlie to choose.\nIn total there are 29 * 26 * (15+6+8-3) choices.\n\nThe number of choices for Alice is 29.  The number of choices for Bob, given Alice's choice, is 26.  The number of choices for Charlie, given Alice's and Bob's choices, is the number of remaining choices, which is determined by the kind of pet each chose previously. There are 29 choices for Alice, 26 choices for Bob, and then 29 choices for Alice minus 2 (Alice's choice and Bob's choice) for Charlie.\n\n\nConsider the cases:\nIf Alice chose a puppy, there are 6 choices for Bob (kittens) and 8 choices for Charlie (hamsters). That's 6*8 = 48 ways.\nIf Alice chose a kitten, there are 15 choices for Bob (puppies) and 8 choices for Charlie (hamsters). That's 15*8 = 120 ways.\nIf Alice chose a hamster, there are 15 choices for Bob (puppies) and 6 choices for Charlie (kittens). That's 15*6 = 90 ways.\nThe total number of ways is 48 + 120 + 90 = 258.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{258}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Ignoring who gets which pet for now, we can see that there are $15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8$ ways to choose one puppy, one kitten, and one hamster. Now, Alice has three choices for which type of pet she wants, Bob has two, and Charlie has one, due to the constraint that they must each have a different type of pet.
