They choose their seats at random.  What is the probability that they don't sit next to each other?",
        "inference": "1. Total ways to choose 2 seats out of 7 is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$.\n2. Total ways for Mary and James to sit in 7 chairs is $7 \\times 6 = 42$ ways.\n3. Number of ways for Mary and James to sit next to each other:\n   - Treat Mary and James as a single unit. There are 6 possible positions for this unit (e.g., M J, J M).\n   - Within the unit, Mary and James can switch places, so there are 2 ways.\n   - So there are $6 \\times 2 = 12$ ways for them to sit next to each other.\n4. Number of ways for them NOT to sit next to each other:\n   - Total ways to choose 2 seats - ways to sit next to each other = $42 - 12 = 30$ ways.\n5. Probability that they don't sit next to each other is $\\frac{30}{42} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
