I hope it is correct.'\nA drawer in a darkened room contains $100$ red socks, $80$ green socks, $60$ blue socks and $40$ black socks. A youngster selects socks one at a time from the drawer but is unable to see the color of the socks drawn. What is the smallest number of socks that must be selected to guarantee that the selection contains at least $10$ pairs? (A pair of socks is two socks of the same color. No sock may be counted in more than one pair.)\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 21\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 23\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 30\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 50$\n",
        "inference": "Worst case scenario: the youngster picks one sock of each color.  This means the youngster picks 4 socks.\nThen, the youngster picks one sock of each color again.  This means the youngster picks 4 socks.\nThe youngster continues to pick 4 socks until they have picked 9 socks of each color. This would be 9 socks of each color $\\times 4$ colors = 36 socks total.\nSo far, we only have 9 pairs.\nWe need at least 10 pairs.\nThe youngster picks 4 more socks: 1 of each color.\nThis gives us 9 pairs plus 1 more pair.\nWe have 36 + 4 = 40 socks.\nThe youngster has 40 socks, 10 pairs.\nTo guarantee that the selection contains at least 10 pairs, we need to pick 4 * 9 = 36 socks.\nIf the youngster selects 4 * 9 = 36 socks, we can pick 9 pairs, and 4 additional socks will guarantee us a 10th pair. This would be 36+4=40 socks.\nWorst case scenario: we pick 3 socks of each color, so we have 3*4 = 12 socks. This gives us 3 * 4 = 12 socks.\nThe next 4 socks are either each of a different color.\nPicking 3 * 4 = 12 socks.\nIf we get 3 of each color (12 socks), we can only form 3 pairs.

        "ground_truth": "Suppose that you wish to draw one pair of socks from the drawer. Then you would pick $5$ socks (one of each kind, plus one). Notice that in the worst possible situation, you will continue to draw the same sock, until you get $10$ pairs. This is because drawing the same sock results in a pair every $2$ of that sock, whereas drawing another sock creates another pair. Thus the answer is $5+2\\cdot(10-1) = \\boxed{23}$."

        "inference": "To guarantee at least 10 pairs of socks, we need to consider the worst-case scenario.  The worst-case scenario is that we pick 3 socks of each color, which gives us 12 socks.  The next sock we pick must be a sock of one of the colors we already have 3 of, thus creating a pair.  So, 12 + 1 = 13 socks guarantees at least 4 pairs.  We need 10 pairs, so we need 9 more pairs.  The worst case to get 9 more pairs is picking 3 socks of each of the 4 colors, which is 12 socks.  If we have 3 socks of each color, we have 3 pairs. To guarantee the 10th pair, we need to pick at least 1 more sock of each color.  This means 1*4 = 4 more socks.  So, we need 12+4 = 16 socks. 12+4= 16. To have 10 pairs, we already have 3 of each color. 3+3 = 6 socks. We need 4 pairs. 3 of each color gives us 3 pairs. The next 1 sock of each color. 3(4)+1(4) = 16 socks. The next 4 socks will guarantee 4 pairs. 12+4 = 16 socks to ensure we have 4 pairs. We need 9 pairs, worst case scenario we have 3 socks of each color for a total of 12 socks and 3 pairs. The next 4 socks guarantees the additional pairs.  12+4 = 16 socks to guarantee 7 pairs. We need 9 pairs, so we have 3 of each color for 12 socks and 3 pairs. The next 4 socks will guarantee us the additional pairs needed to get to 9 pairs. So, 12+4 = 16. We need 10 pairs.  Worst case: 12 socks gives us 3 pairs.  Then 7 more pairs will need at least 7 more socks. 12+7 = 19.  We need 3 of each, so 12. Then the next 1 will give a pair. So 13. 9 more pairs.  That means 9 more pairs are needed. 12 socks give 3 pairs.  The worst case is to pick 3 of each color for 12 socks.  12+8 = 20. If we pick 3 of each, we get 12 socks, and then the next 4 socks guarantee us another 4 pairs. So 16 socks.\n\n\n12+8=20.  So 20 socks guarantee 10 pairs.   We need at least 12 socks to guarantee at least 4 pairs.  To get 10 pairs, 3 socks for each color is 12. The next 8 will guarantee us at least 2 more pairs. 12+8 = 20 socks.\n\n$\\boxed{20}$\n",
