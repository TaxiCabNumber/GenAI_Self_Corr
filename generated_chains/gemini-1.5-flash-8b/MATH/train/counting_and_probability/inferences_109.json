At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "1. Since all three triplets are in the starting lineup, we need to choose the remaining 3 starters from the remaining 11 players (14 players total - 3 triplets).\n2. The number of ways to choose 3 players from 11 players is given by the combination formula:  \u00b9\u00b9C\u2083 = \u00b9\u00b9! / (3! * (11-3)!) = \u00b9\u00b9! / (3! * 8!) = (11 * 10 * 9) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 165.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{165}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If all triplets are in the starting lineup, we are choosing the 3 remaining starters from 11 players, which can be done in  $\\binom{11}{3} = \\boxed{165}$ ways."
