        "inference": "Let $A$ be the set of integers between 1 and 999 without a zero digit.  There are $9^3 = 729$ such integers.  If $a+b = 1000$, then $b = 1000 - a$.  For a given $a \\in A$, we want $b = 1000 - a$ to be in $A$.  This is true if $1000 - a \\in A$, which means $1000-a$ has no zero digits.\n\nWe are looking for pairs $(a,b)$ with $a+b=1000$ and $a, b$ in $A$.  However, $a$ and $b$ can be the same, so we consider the case $a=b$ first. We need $2a=1000$, $a=500$. But $500$ has a zero digit, so this case is not possible. Thus $a \\ne b$.\n\nFor each $a \\in A$, $1000-a \\in A$ unless $1000-a$ has a zero digit.  We have $9^3$ values of $a$ and $9^3$ values of $1000-a$.\nSince $a$ and $1000-a$ are both in $A$, the number of pairs is $9^3$.\n\nIf $a=123$, $b=877$. If $a=130$, $b=870$, $b$ has a zero. Thus $a$ and $b$ must be such that $1000-a$ has no zero.\nThere are $729$ values for $a$ in $A$. If $a \\in A$, $1000-a \\in A$ implies $a \\neq 500$.\nSo for every $a \\in A$, except for $500$, $1000-a \\in A$.  If $a=500$, $1000-a=500$ has a zero.\nThus the possible pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \\ne b$ is $9^3 = 729$.\nThe total number of pairs is $\\frac{9^3}{2} = \\frac{729}{2}$ which is not an integer. This is incorrect.\nHowever, if $a=123$, $b=877$. $a \\ne b$.\nIf we have a solution $(a,b)$, then $(b,a)$ is also a solution, so we need to divide by 2.\n\nThere are $9^3$ possible values for $a$, but if $a=500$, then $1000-a=500$.\nHalf of the pairs will have the same value.  The number of such pairs is $\\frac{729}{2}$ is not an integer.\n\nThe number of possible pairs is $\\frac{9^3}{2} = \\frac{729}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(729) = 364.5$ which is wrong.\n\nThe pairs $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ are the same.\nThere are $9^3 = 729$ integers without zeros.\nIf $a \\ne b$, $a+b = 1000$. So the number of pairs is $\\frac{729}{2}$. This is not correct.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3645}$",
