At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ice cream shop offers 6 kinds of ice cream. What is the greatest number of two scoop sundaes that can be made such that each sundae contains two types of ice cream and no two sundaes are the same combination?",
        "inference": "To make a two-scoop sundae, we need to choose 2 different types of ice cream from the 6 available.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 ice cream flavors from 6 is given by the combination formula:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\nIn this case, $n = 6$ and $k = 2$.\n$$\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15$$\nThus, there are 15 possible combinations of two different ice cream flavors.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 6 choices of ice cream and each sundae must consist of 2 of them, there are ${6 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{15}$ kinds of two scoop sundaes."
