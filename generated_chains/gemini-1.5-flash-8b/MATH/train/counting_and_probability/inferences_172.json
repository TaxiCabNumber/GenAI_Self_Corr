        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy grandpa has 10 pieces of art, including 3 prints by Escher. If he hangs the pieces of art in a row in a random order, what is the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to arrange 10 pieces of art in a row is 10!.\n2. Treat the 3 Escher prints as a single block.  There are 8 other pieces and the 3 Escher prints, giving us 8+1=9 objects to arrange.\n3. The number of ways to arrange these 9 objects is 9!.\n4. Within the block of 3 Escher prints, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n5. Thus, the number of arrangements where the 3 Escher prints are together is 9! * 3!.\n6. The probability that the 3 Escher prints are together is (9! * 3!) / 10!\n7. Simplifying, (9! * 3!) / 10! = (9! * 3!) / (10 * 9!) = 3/10\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item. It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways. There are also a total of $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions. Thus the probability that we want is $\\dfrac{8}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}}$."
