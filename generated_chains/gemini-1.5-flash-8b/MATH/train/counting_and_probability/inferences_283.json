There are four identical rooms that they can stay in. If any number of the cousins can stay in one room, how many different ways are there to put the cousins in the rooms?",

We have 4 cousins (stars) and we want to distribute them into 4 rooms (boxes).\n\nThe general formula for distributing $n$ identical items into $k$ distinct boxes is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.\nIn this case, $n = 4$ and $k = 4$.\nThe number of ways is $\\binom{4+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 7 \\times 5 = 35$.\n\nThe different ways to put the 4 cousins in the 4 rooms are:\n(4,0,0,0)\n(3,1,0,0)\n(2,2,0,0)\n(2,1,1,0)\n(1,1,1,1)\n(1,0,3,0)\n(0,4,0,0)\netc.\n\n(4,0,0,0) means 4 cousins in one room and the other rooms empty.\n(3,1,0,0) means 3 cousins in one room, 1 cousin in another room, and 0 cousins in the other two rooms.\n(2,2,0,0) means 2 cousins in one room, 2 cousins in another room, and 0 cousins in the other two rooms.\n(2,1,1,0) means 2 cousins in one room, 1 cousin in another room, 1 cousin in another room, and 0 cousins in the last room.\n(1,1,1,1) means 1 cousin in each room.\n\nUsing stars and bars, the number of ways to put $n$ identical items into $k$ distinct boxes is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.\nIn this case, $n=4$ (cousins) and $k=4$ (rooms).\nSo, the number of ways is $\\binom{4+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{35}$",
