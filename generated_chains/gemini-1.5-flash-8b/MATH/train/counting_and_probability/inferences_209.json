At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are five unmarked envelopes on a table, each with a letter for a different person.  If the mail is randomly distributed to these five people, with each person getting one letter, what is the probability that exactly four people get the right letter?",
        "inference": "There are 5! = 120 possible ways to distribute the letters.\nTo have exactly 4 people get the correct letter, we need to determine the one person who gets the wrong letter.\nWe can choose which person receives the wrong letter in 5 ways.\nOnce we choose the person who receives the wrong letter, there are 4! ways to distribute the other 4 letters correctly.\nThus, there are 5 * 4! = 5 * 24 = 120 ways for exactly 4 people to get the correct letter.\nThe probability is then 120/120 = 1.  However, this is incorrect.\nThe possible ways for exactly 4 people to get the correct letter is to have one person get the wrong letter.\nThere are 5 choices for the person who gets the wrong letter.  The other 4 letters are matched.  This means that 4 people get the right letter, and one person gets the wrong letter.\nSo there are 5 ways to have one person get the wrong letter.\nThe number of ways to distribute 5 letters to 5 people is 5! = 120.\nWe want exactly 4 people to have the correct letter.\nIf person 1 gets the wrong letter, there are 4 choices for person 1's letter.\nThere are 4 choices for the remaining 4 letters, and the letter goes to the correct person.\nPerson 1 gets the wrong letter in 4 ways, 2 gets the wrong letter, 3 gets the wrong letter, 4 gets the wrong letter, and 5 gets the wrong letter.\nThus, there are 5 ways to choose who gets the wrong letter, and there is one way for each of those ways to choose the wrong letter, then there are 4 remaining letters to be distributed to the other 4 people, so there are 4! = 24 ways.\nTotal ways for exactly 4 people to get the correct letter is 5 * 4! = 5 * 24 = 120.\nThe probability is 120/120 = 1.\nIf 4 letters are put in the correct envelopes, then one letter must be in the wrong envelope.\nSo, we can think of the wrong letter in 5 ways. There are 4 choices for where to put the wrong letter. Thus, there are 4 choices for the wrong letter to be in the wrong envelope.  For example, suppose 1 gets 2. Then 2 must get a different letter than 1.\nSo there are 4 remaining letters for the wrong letter to go in.\nThere are 4 remaining people to give the correct letter to.\nThe remaining letter can be given to any one of the other 4 people.\nIn 5! ways, we can arrange the letters.\nThere are 5 ways to choose the person who gets the wrong letter.  Then there is 1 way to give each of the 4 letters to the correct people.\nSo there is 1 way to assign each person to the correct person, and 1 person gets the wrong letter.\nThe probability is $\\frac{5 \\times 4!}{5!} = \\frac{5 \\times 24}{120} = \\frac{120}{120} = 1$.\nThere are 4 possible letters for the one person.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/5}$",
        "ground_truth": "If 4 people get the right letter, then there is only one letter left, and only one person left.  So, the last person will get the right letter, too.  Therefore, it is impossible for exactly four people to get the right letter.  So, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$."
