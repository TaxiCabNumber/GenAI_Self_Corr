At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that has 43 numbers?",
        "inference": "The $n$th row of Pascal's triangle contains $n+1$ numbers.  We want the second number in the row with 43 numbers.  This means the row has 43 numbers, so $n+1=43$, which implies $n=42$.  The second number in row $n$ is the number $\\binom{n}{1} = \\frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} = n$.\nTherefore, the second number in row 42 is $\\binom{42}{1} = 42$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{42}$",
        "ground_truth": "The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers.  The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers.  The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers.  Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list.  So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\\binom{k}{0}, \\binom{k}{1}, \\binom{k}{2}, \\ldots, \\binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 43 numbers starts 1, $\\boxed{42}$."
