At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly two of the triplets are in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose 2 triplets out of 3. This can be done in $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(1)} = 3$ ways.\n2. Once we have chosen the 2 triplets, we need to choose the remaining $6-2=4$ players from the remaining $14-3=11$ players. This can be done in $\\binom{11}{4} = \\frac{11!}{4!(11-4)!} = \\frac{11!}{4!7!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 11 \\times 10 \\times 3 = 330$ ways.\n3. To find the total number of ways to choose 6 starters with exactly 2 of the triplets, we multiply the number of ways to choose the triplets by the number of ways to choose the remaining players: $3 \\times 330 = 990$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{990}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly two of the triplets are in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplets to put in the starting lineup (we can see this by noting that we have 3 choices for which triplet to leave out), and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 4 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{4} = 3 \\times 330= \\boxed{990}$."
