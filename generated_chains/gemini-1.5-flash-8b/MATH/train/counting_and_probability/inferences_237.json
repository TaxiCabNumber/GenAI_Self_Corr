At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarius is entering a wildlife photo contest, and wishes to arrange his seven snow leopards of different heights in a row. If the shortest two leopards have inferiority complexes and demand to be placed at the ends of the row, how many ways can he line up the leopards?",
        "inference": "1. The shortest two leopards must be at the ends.  This fixes their positions.\n2. There are 5 remaining leopards.\n3. The 5 remaining leopards can be arranged in the 5 remaining positions in 5! ways.\n4. 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two ways to arrange the shortest two leopards. For the five remaining leopards, there are $5!$ ways to arrange them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $2\\times5!=\\boxed{240\\text{ ways.}}$"
