At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
        "inference": "We need to find the number of ways to select 4 crayons from 12 crayons without considering the order. This is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is given by:\n$$C(n, k) = \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\nIn this case, n = 12 (total number of crayons) and k = 4 (number of crayons to be selected).\n$$C(12, 4) = \\binom{12}{4} = \\frac{12!}{4!(12-4)!} = \\frac{12!}{4!8!} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{11880}{24} = 495$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{495}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways."
