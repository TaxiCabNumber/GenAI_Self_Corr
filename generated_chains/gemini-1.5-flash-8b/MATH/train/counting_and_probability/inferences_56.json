At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenna is at a fair with four friends. They all want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can fit in a car. How many different groups of three can the five of them make?",
        "inference": "We need to find the number of ways to choose 3 people from a group of 5. This is a combination problem, as the order in which the people are chosen does not matter.\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nwhere n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\nIn this case, n = 5 (the total number of friends) and k = 3 (the number of people that can fit in a car).\n$$ \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 $$\nSo there are 10 different groups of three that can be made from the five friends.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$."
