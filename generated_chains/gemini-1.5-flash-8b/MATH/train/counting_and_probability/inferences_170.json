At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads?",
        "inference": "1. Possible outcomes:\n   Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails).  Since there are 4 coins, there are 2^4 = 16 possible outcomes.\n\n2. Combinations of heads:\n   We need to determine the combinations of heads that yield at least 15 cents.  The coins are a penny (1 cent), a nickel (5 cents), a dime (10 cents), and a quarter (25 cents).\n   * 1 quarter: 25 cents (1 quarter, 0 nickel, 0 dime, 0 penny)  (1 way)\n   * 1 dime and 1 quarter: 35 cents (impossible)\n   * 3 quarters: 75 cents (impossible)\n   * 2 quarters: 50 cents (impossible)\n\n\n3. Identifying the combinations that sum to at least 15 cents:\n   * 1 quarter (25 cents): 1 way (H, T, T, T)\n   * 1 quarter + 1 dime + 1 nickel + 1 penny = 41 cents (impossible)\n   * 1 quarter + 1 dime = 35 cents (impossible)\n   * 1 quarter + 1 dime + 1 nickel = 40 cents\n   * 1 quarter + 1 nickel = 30 cents\n   * 1 quarter + 1 penny = 26 cents\n\n   * 1 nickel + 1 dime = 15 cents\n   * 2 nickels = 10 cents\n   * 1 nickel and 1 penny= 6 cents\n\n   * 3 nickels + 1 penny= 16 cents\n   * 1 nickel = 5 cents\n   * 1 dime = 10 cents\n   * 1 penny = 1 cent\n   * 2 dimes = 20 cents\n   * 3 dimes = 30 cents\n   * 4 dimes= 40 cents\n   * 2 nickels + 1 dime + 1 penny= 16 cents\n   * 2 nickels + 1 dime = 20 cents\n\n4. The combinations that yield at least 15 cents:\n   * 1 dime + 1 nickel = 15 cents\n   * 1 dime + 2 nickels + 1 penny = 16 cents\n   * 2 dimes = 20 cents\n   * 1 quarter = 25 cents\n\n5. Calculating the probability for each combination:\n   * 1 dime + 1 nickel: (1 way to get 1 dime, 1 way to get 1 nickel). 2 ways/(16 possible outcomes) = 2/16 = 1/8.\n   * 1 quarter: (1 way) / (16) = 1/16.\n    \n   * 2 dimes:  (1 way) / (16) = 1/16\n   * 3 nickels + 1 penny= 17 cents\n\n\n6.

        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). If the quarter is heads, there are 8 possibilities, since each of the other three coins may come up heads or tails.  If the quarter is tails, then the nickel and dime must be heads, so there are 2 possibilities, since the penny can be heads or tails.  So there are $8+2 = 10$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{10}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}$."
