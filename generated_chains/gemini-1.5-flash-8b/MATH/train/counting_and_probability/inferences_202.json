At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "1. The probability of drawing a blue chip on the first draw is 5/8.\n2. The probability of drawing a yellow chip on the first draw is 3/8.\n3. If a blue chip is drawn first, the probability of drawing a yellow chip on the second draw is 3/8.  The probability of this sequence is (5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64.\n4. If a yellow chip is drawn first, the probability of drawing a blue chip on the second draw is 5/8.  The probability of this sequence is (3/8) * (5/8) = 15/64.\n5. The probability of drawing chips of different colors is the sum of the probabilities of the two sequences above.\n   (15/64) + (15/64) = 30/64 = 15/32.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$."
