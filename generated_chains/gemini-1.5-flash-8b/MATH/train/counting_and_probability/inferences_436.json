I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain cross country meet between 2 teams of 5 runners each, a runner who finishes in the $n$th position contributes $n$ to his teams score. The team with the lower score wins. If there are no ties among the runners, how many different winning scores are possible?\n(A) 10 (B) 13 (C) 27 (D) 120 (E) 126\n",

Thus, we are looking for the number of possible scores $S_A$ such that there exists a score $S_B$ with $S_A < S_B$ and both are between 15 and 40.  Since $S_A$ and $S_B$ can take on any integer value from 15 to 40, the possible winning scores are $S_A$ with $15 \\le S_A \\le 39$.
