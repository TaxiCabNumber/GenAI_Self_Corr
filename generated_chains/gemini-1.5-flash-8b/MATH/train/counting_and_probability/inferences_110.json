        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the number of apples and $o$ be the number of oranges.\nWe have 5 apples and 10 oranges.\nThe number of apples can be any integer from 0 to 5, i.e., $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nThe number of oranges can be any integer from 0 to 10, i.e., $o \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nWe want to find the number of possible combinations of apples and oranges in a fruit basket.\nThe number of ways to choose apples is 6 (0 to 5).\nThe number of ways to choose oranges is 11 (0 to 10).\nThe total number of kinds of fruit baskets is the product of the number of ways to choose apples and the number of ways to choose oranges.\nSo, the total number of kinds of fruit baskets is $6 \\times 11 = 66$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets."
