At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different four-letter arrangements can be formed using the six letters $A, B, C, D, E$ and $F$, if the first letter must be $C$, one of the other letters must be $B$, and no letter can be used more than once in the arrangement?",

This means that $B$ is one of the remaining 3 letters.\n   - If $B$ is the second letter, then we have 4 remaining letters to choose from for the third and fourth letters. This gives $1 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 24$ possible arrangements.\n   - If $B$ is the third letter, then we have 4 remaining letters to choose from for the second and fourth letters.

        "inference": "The possible letters are A, B, C, D, E.\nWe need to form a 4-letter arrangement starting with C.\nWe must have one B in the arrangement.\n\nCase 1: B is the second letter.\nThe first letter is C, the second is B. We have 4 letters (A, D, E) left. We need to choose 2 from the remaining 4 letters.\nThe number of ways to do this is $4 \\times 3 = 12$.\nSo there are 12 arrangements in this case.\n\nCase 2: B is the third letter.\nThe first letter is C.

We need to choose two of the remaining three letters to be in positions 4 and 1.\nThis is $3 \\times 2 = 6$ ways.\nThus there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ ways.\n\nCase 3: B is the fourth letter.\nThe first letter is C.
