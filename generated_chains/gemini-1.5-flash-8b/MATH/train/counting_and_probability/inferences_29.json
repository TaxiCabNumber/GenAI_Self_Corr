The area of the pentagon is the area of the rectangle minus the small triangle formed by A, B, and C (which is part of the pentagon). The area of the rectangle is $(2\\pi + 1 - 0)(4 - 0) = (2\\pi+1)(4) = 8\\pi + 4$. The area of the triangle formed by A, B, and E is 0.5(4)(2) = 4. Thus, the total area of the pentagon is $4(2\\pi+1) - 4 = 8\\pi + 4$. The total area of the rectangle is (2\u03c0+1-4)(4) = 4(2\u03c0-3) = 8\u03c0 - 12.  The triangle formed by A, B, and C is ignored.  Since AB and CD are parallel, the area is indeed the area of a rectangle with vertices A, B, D, and E.

The probability that angle APB is obtuse is the area of the semicircle with diameter AB divided by the area of the pentagon. The area of the semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi (2^2) = 2\\pi$.
