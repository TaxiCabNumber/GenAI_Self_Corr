        "ground_truth": "Since each day it either snows or doesn't snow, we know that the sum of the probabilities of those two events is 1, which means that the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $1-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{3}$. That means the probability of it $\\emph{not}$ snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}$, and once again we know that the probabilities of complementary events sum to 1, so the probability that we're looking for is $1-\\frac{1}{27}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{26}{27}}$."

        "inference": "The probability of snow on a given day is 2/3. The probability of no snow on a given day is 1/3.  We want the probability of snow on at least one of the three days.  This is easier to calculate as 1 minus the probability of no snow on any of the three days.\n\nP(no snow on any of the three days) = (1/3) * (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/27\n\nP(snow on at least one day) = 1 - P(no snow on any of the three days) = 1 - 1/27 = 26/27\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{26}{27}}$",
