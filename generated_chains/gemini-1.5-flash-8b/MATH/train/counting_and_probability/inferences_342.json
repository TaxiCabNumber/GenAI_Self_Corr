At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.\n",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of getting heads in a single flip.\nThe probability of getting exactly one head in five flips is given by $\\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4$.\nThe probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips is given by $\\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3$.\nWe are given that these probabilities are equal, i.e.,\n$$\\binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4 = \\binom{5}{2} p^2 (1-p)^3$$\n$$5 p (1-p)^4 = 10 p^2 (1-p)^3$$\n$$5 p (1-p) = 10 p^2$$\n$$(1-p) = 2 p$$\n$$1 = 3 p$$\n$$p = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThus, the probability of getting heads in a single flip is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 flips is given by\n$$\\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2 = \\binom{5}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4}{9}\\right) = \\frac{40}{243}$$\nThus, $\\frac{i}{j} = \\frac{40}{243}$.\nSince $\\frac{40}{243}$ is in lowest terms, we have $i=40$ and $j=243$.\nThen $i+j = 40+243 = 283$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{283}$",
        "ground_truth": "Denote the probability of getting a heads in one flip of the biased coin as $h$. Based upon the problem, note that ${5\\choose1}(h)^1(1-h)^4 = {5\\choose2}(h)^2(1-h)^3$.
