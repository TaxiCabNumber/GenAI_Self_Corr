At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMax picks two different cards without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the cards are of different suits?",
        "inference": "There are $\\binom{52}{2}$ ways to choose two cards from a standard 52-card deck.\nThere are 4 suits, and each suit has 13 cards.\nThe number of ways to pick two cards of different suits is:\nPick one card from the first suit, say hearts. There are 13 ways to do this.\nPick one card from a second suit. There are 13 ways to do this.\nThere are 3 other suits, so there are $13 \\times 13 \\times 3 = 13^2 \\times 3$ ways to pick two cards from different suits.\nAlternatively, we can pick one card from any of the 4 suits, and then pick one card from the remaining 3 suits. This gives us $13 \\times 3 \\times 13$ ways.\n\nSo, there are $13 \\times 13 \\times 3 = 507$ ways.\nThere are 13 choices for the first suit. For each choice, there are 3 suits left, and 13 choices for the second suit. This gives $13 \\times 3 \\times 13$ ways to pick two cards of different suits.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52 is $\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 26 \\times 51 = 1326$.\nThe number of ways to pick 2 cards of different suits is $13 \\times 13 \\times 3 = 507$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{507}{1326} = \\frac{13 \\times 39}{13 \\times 102} = \\frac{39}{102} = \\frac{13}{34}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{39}{51}}$",
        "ground_truth": "Once Max has chosen the first card, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 39 do not have the same suit as the first chosen card.  Therefore, the probability that the two cards have different suits is $\\dfrac{39}{51} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}$."
