        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCrestwood Elementary School has an active four-square league, consisting of ten players, including Justin and Tim. Each day at recess, the ten players split into two four-square games, each with five players in no relevant order. Over the course of a semester, each possible match-up of five players occurs once. How many times did Justin play in the same game as Tim?",
        "inference": "1. We need to find the number of ways to choose 5 players out of 10. This is given by $\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 252$.\n2. Each of the 252 possible combinations of 5 players occurs once over the semester.\n3. In each game of 5 players, there are $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$ possible pairs of players.\n4. For each of the 252 possible games, there are 10 possible pairs of players.\n5. We are interested in the number of times Justin and Tim are in the same game.\n6. Since each game has 5 players and Justin and Tim are in the same game, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 more players out of the remaining 8 players. This is given by $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\n7. Since each possible game of 5 players occurs once, and for each game of 5 players, Justin and Tim are in the game in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways.\n8. Therefore, Justin and Tim play together in $252 \\times \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{252 \\times 56}{10} = 252 \\times 5.6 = 1411.2$.\n9. The calculation is incorrect, as Justin and Tim are always in the same game. We are considering that Justin and Tim are playing together in one of the games, not in any combination.\n\n\nThere are 252 possible groups of 5 players. In each of those groups, there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ pairs of players. In each game of 5 players, Justin and Tim will be in $\\binom{8}{3}$ possible pairs. \n1. In each of the 252 possible games, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose two players.\n2. In the $\\binom{10}{5}$ groups of 5 players, we look for the case where Justin and Tim are in the same group.\n3. Out of the remaining 8 players, we need to pick 3. This is $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$.\n4. Thus, Justin and Tim will play together 56 times in each of the 252 games.\n5. Therefore, Justin and Tim will play together a total of $56 \\times 252 = 14112$ times in the semester.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14112}$",
        "ground_truth": "Each game has 5 players. The games that we are counting include Justin, Tim, and 3 of the 8 other players. There are $\\binom{8}{3}$ = 56 such match-ups.\n\n\nAlternatively, There are $\\binom{10}{5}$ = 252 different possible match-ups involving 5 of the 10 players. By symmetry, every player plays in exactly half of them, 126 games. In each of the 126 games that Tim plays, he plays with 4 of the other 9 players. Again by symmetry, he plays with each of those 9 players in 4/9 of his games. So he plays against Justin in 4/9 of 126 games, or $\\boxed{56}$ games."
