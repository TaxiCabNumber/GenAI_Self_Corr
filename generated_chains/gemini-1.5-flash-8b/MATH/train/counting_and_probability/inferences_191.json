However, the boxes are indistinguishable.  If we put 3 balls in box 1 and 2 balls in box 2, it is the same as putting 2 balls in box 1 and 3 balls in box 2.\n4.  Let's consider the different distributions of balls into the two boxes:\n    * 5-0: $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way\n    * 4-1: $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways\n    * 3-2: $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways\n    * 2-3: $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways\n    * 1-4: $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways\n    * 0-5: $\\binom{5}{0} = 1$ way\n5.

        "inference": "To distribute 5 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes, we first consider the case where the boxes are distinguishable.  There are $2^5 = 32$ ways to do this.\n\nHowever, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we have overcounted by a factor of 2.  Thus we divide by 2.

Thus we need only consider the cases (5,0), (4,1), (3,2). The number of ways to distribute the balls is\n$\\binom{5}{5} + \\binom{5}{4} + \\binom{5}{3} = 1+5+10=16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$",
