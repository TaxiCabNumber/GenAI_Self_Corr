At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil rolls 6 fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that at least two dice show the same number?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 6 dice:  6^6 = 46656\n\n2. Calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers.  This is a permutation problem.  There are 6 choices for the first die, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, and so on.  So, 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n\n3. Calculate the probability of all dice showing different numbers: 720 / 46656\n\n4. Calculate the probability of at least two dice showing the same number:  1 - (probability of all dice showing different numbers) = 1 - (720 / 46656)\n\n5. Simplify the fraction:  1 - (720 / 46656) = 1 - (5/324)\n\n6. Calculate the difference: 1 - (5/324) = 319/324\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{319}{324}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
