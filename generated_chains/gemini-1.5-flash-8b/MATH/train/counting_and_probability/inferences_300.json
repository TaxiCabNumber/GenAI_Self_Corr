Use the formula for permutations with repetitions:\n   The number of ways to arrange n objects, where n1 are of one kind, n2 are of a second kind, ..., nk are of a k-th kind, is given by n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!).\n\n4.

Calculate the factorials:\n   6! = 720\n   2! = 2\n   Therefore, 6! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 720 / (2 * 2 * 2) = 720 / 8 = 90\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$\n",
