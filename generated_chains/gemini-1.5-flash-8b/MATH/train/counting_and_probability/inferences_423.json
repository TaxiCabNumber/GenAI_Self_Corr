When the particle is at the point $(a,b)$, it moves at random to one of the points $(a-1,b)$, $(a,b-1)$, or $(a-1,b-1)$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$, independently of its previous moves. The probability that it will hit the coordinate axes at $(0,0)$ is $\\frac{m}{3^n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers such that $m$ is not divisible by $3$. Find $m + n$.\n",

        "inference": "The probability is $\\frac{70}{3^8}$.  To find the probability of reaching (0,0) from (4,4), we need to count the number of paths that consist of 4 steps in the -x direction and 4 steps in the -y direction.  The total number of steps is 8, and the number of ways to choose the 4 x steps is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$. The total number of paths is $3^8$.  So the probability is $\\frac{70}{3^8}$.  The problem asks for $m+n$, where the probability is $\\frac{m}{3^n}$.  Thus, $m=70$ and $n=8$.  Then $m+n=70+8=78$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$",
