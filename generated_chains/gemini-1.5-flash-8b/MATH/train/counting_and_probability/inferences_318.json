At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 5 people be seated around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1.  For the first person, there is only 1 way to seat them since their position is fixed relative to the circular table.\n2.  For the second person, there are 4 remaining seats.\n3.  For the third person, there are 3 remaining seats.\n4.  For the fourth person, there are 2 remaining seats.\n5.  For the fifth person, there is only 1 remaining seat.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 1 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 5 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$."
