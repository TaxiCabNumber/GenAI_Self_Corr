At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nInterior numbers begin in the third row of Pascal's Triangle. The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
        "inference": "The interior numbers in Pascal's Triangle are the numbers other than the 1s at the edges.\nThe third row is 1 3 3 1. The interior numbers are 3 and 3, sum is 6.\nThe fourth row is 1 4 6 4 1. The interior numbers are 4, 6, and 4, sum is 14.\nThe fifth row is 1 5 10 10 5 1. The interior numbers are 5, 10, 10, and 5, sum is 30.\nThe sixth row is 1 6 15 20 15 6 1. The interior numbers are 6, 15, 20, 15, and 6, sum is 62.\nThe seventh row is 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1.

        "ground_truth": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$."
