At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can the digits of $45,\\!520$ be arranged to form a 5-digit number?  (Remember, numbers cannot begin with 0.)",
        "inference": "We have the digits 4, 5, 5, 2, 0. There are 5 digits in total.\nWe want to arrange these digits to form a 5-digit number.\nThe first digit cannot be 0.\nThe digits are 4, 5, 5, 2, 0.\nThe total number of arrangements without considering the restriction on the first digit is $\\frac{5!}{2!} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60$.\nNow, consider the arrangements where the first digit is 0. If the first digit is 0, then we have the digits 4, 5, 5, 2, which can be arranged in $\\frac{4!}{2!} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$ ways.\nThe total number of arrangements where the first digit is not 0 is $60 - 12 = 48$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First we place the $0$, which we only have four options for (everywhere but the first digit).  Then we have 4 remaining places to put the last 4 digits, two of which are not unique (the fives), so there are $\\dfrac{4!}{2!}$ options for arranging the other 4 digits.
