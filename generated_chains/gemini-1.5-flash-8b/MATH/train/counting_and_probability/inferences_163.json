        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lottery in our state consists of two drawings.  First, a MegaBall is picked from among 27 numbered balls.  Second, five WinnerBalls are picked from among 44 numbered balls. To win the lottery, you must pick the MegaBall number correctly and also pick the numbers on the five WinnerBalls (but you don't need to get the order right for the WinnerBalls).  What is the probability that the ticket I hold has the winning numbers?",
        "inference": "The probability of picking the correct MegaBall is $\\frac{1}{27}$.\nThe number of ways to pick 5 WinnerBalls from 44 is $\\binom{44}{5}$.\nThe number of possible combinations of 5 WinnerBalls is $\\binom{44}{5} = \\frac{44!}{5!(44-5)!} = \\frac{44!}{5!39!} = \\frac{44 \\times 43 \\times 42 \\times 41 \\times 40}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1,086,600$.\nThe probability of picking the correct 5 WinnerBalls is $\\frac{1}{1,086,600}$.\nThe probability of picking both the correct MegaBall and the correct WinnerBalls is the product of the probabilities.\nProbability = $\\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{1}{1,086,600} = \\frac{1}{29,362,200}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{29,362,200}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the MegaBall matches is $\\dfrac{1}{27}$ . The probability that the 5 WinnerBalls match is $\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}$.
