        "ground_truth": "There are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total pairings of teams, and thus $2^{780}$ possible outcomes. In order for no two teams to win the same number of games, they must each win a different number of games.

With this in mind, we see that there are a total of $40!$ outcomes in which no two teams win the same number of games.
