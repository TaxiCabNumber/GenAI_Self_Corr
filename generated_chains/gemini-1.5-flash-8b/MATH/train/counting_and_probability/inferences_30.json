At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal?",
        "inference": "Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of dice showing even numbers.\nSince each die has 6 sides, the probability of rolling an even number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of rolling an odd number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe want to find the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal. This means we need to have 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers.\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling 6 dice is $6^6$.\nThe number of ways to have 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\nThe probability of getting 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers is given by\n$$ \\binom{6}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = 20 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = 20 \\left(\\frac{1}{64}\\right) = \\frac{20}{64} = \\frac{5}{16} $$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$\n",
