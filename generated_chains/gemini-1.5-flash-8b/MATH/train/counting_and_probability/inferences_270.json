At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
        "inference": "1. **Edges:** A cube has 12 edges.  Any two edges form a triangle.  A cube has 8 vertices.\n2. **Equilateral triangles:**  No equilateral triangles are possible.\n3. **Right triangles:** Right triangles can be formed by connecting two edges meeting at a right angle and the diagonal.  There are 4 such right triangles for each vertex.  There are 8 vertices, thus there are $4\\times8 = 32$ right triangles. But this counts each triangle twice (e.g., the triangle formed from vertices A, B, C is the same as the triangle formed from vertices C, B, A). Thus we have $32/2=16$ right triangles.\n4. **Isosceles triangles:**  There are triangles with two sides of equal length.  These can have side lengths equal to the edge length of the cube, the length of the body diagonal, and/or the length of the space diagonal.\n5. **Scalene triangles:**  There are triangles with all three sides of different lengths.\n6. **Counting method:** We can count all the triangles. There are $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\times7\\times6}{3\\times2\\times1} = 56$ possible ways to choose 3 vertices from the 8 vertices of a cube.\n7. **Triangles from edges:** There are 12 edges.  Picking three points from these 12 edges does not form a triangle in 3D space. This counting method doesn't work.\n\nCase 1: Triangles with sides equal to the edges.  There are 12 edges.

This leads to $12 \\times 12$ counts. However, the triangle should be distinct.\nCase 3: Triangles with sides equal to the face diagonal.  We have 6 faces.
