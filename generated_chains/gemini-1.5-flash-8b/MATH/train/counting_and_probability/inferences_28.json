At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMahmoud tosses three coins. What is the probability that he will get at least one head?",

The outcomes with at least one head are:\n   HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH.\n\n3. There are 7 outcomes with at least one head.\n\n4. The probability of getting at least one head is the number of outcomes with at least one head divided by the total number of outcomes.\n   Probability = 7/8\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$."
