        "inference": "The problem states that the middle digit $b$ must be larger than the other two digits, $a$ and $c$.  This means that we are looking for the number of 3-digit numbers where the middle digit is greater than the other two.\nThe number of ways to choose $a$ and $c$ for a given $b$ is $b$.
