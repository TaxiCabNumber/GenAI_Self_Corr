        "inference": "Let the 5 friends be A, B, C, D, E.\nCara is in a fixed position.\nThe two friends sitting on either side of Cara are the pair of people she is sitting between.\nIf Cara is in the middle, then there are 2 friends sitting on either side of her.  The friend on the left can be any of the remaining 4 friends. Once the friend on the left is chosen, there is only 1 choice for the friend on the right, since the other friends are already chosen.  Therefore, there are 4 possible pairs.\nIf Cara is at the end of the line, then there is only 1 friend on one side of her. There are 4 choices for the friend on the other side.  So there are 4 choices for a pair.\nHowever, the friends can be arranged in 2 ways.  For example, if A is on the left and B is on the right, then B is on the left and A is on the right.  \nIf Cara is in the middle, the two friends are distinct.  The two friends on either side of Cara form a pair. The friend on the left can be any of the remaining 4. Once the friend on the left is chosen, the friend on the right is uniquely determined. There are 4 choices for the friend on the left of Cara.\nTherefore, there are 4 pairs of friends sitting on either side of Cara.\nThe number of pairs is 4.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe possible pairs are:\n1.  (A,B)\n2.  (A,C)\n3.  (A,D)\n4.  (A,E)\n5.  (B,C)\n6.  (B,D)\n7.  (B,E)\n8.  (C,D)\n9.  (C,E)\n10.
