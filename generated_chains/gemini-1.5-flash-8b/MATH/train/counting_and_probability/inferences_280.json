At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Morse code, each symbol is represented by a sequence of dashes and dots. How many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes?",
