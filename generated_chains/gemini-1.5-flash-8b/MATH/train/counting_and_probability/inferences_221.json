At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNo two students in Mrs. Vale's 26-student mathematics class have the same two initials. Each student's first name and last name begin with the same letter. If the letter ``Y'' is considered a vowel, what is the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The possible vowels are A, E, I, O, U, Y.\n5. There are 6 vowels.\n6. Each student has a unique pair of initials.\n7. The number of possible pairs of initials is the number of vowels squared, since each letter must be a vowel.\n8. The number of possible pairs of initials is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n9. The probability of picking a student whose initials are vowels is the number of vowel pairs divided by the total number of possible student initials.\n10.
