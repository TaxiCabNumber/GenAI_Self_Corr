At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of a professional bowling tournament, the top 5 bowlers have a playoff. First #5 bowls #4. The loser receives $5$th prize and the winner bowls #3 in another game. The loser of this game receives $4$th prize and the winner bowls #2. The loser of this game receives $3$rd prize and the winner bowls #1. The winner of this game gets 1st prize and the loser gets 2nd prize. In how many orders can bowlers #1 through #5 receive the prizes?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 120\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$\n",
        "inference": "There are 2 choices for the winner of the first game (#5 vs #4).\nThere are 2 choices for the winner of the second game (winner of #5 vs #4 vs #3).\nThere are 2 choices for the winner of the third game (winner of previous game vs #2).\nThere are 2 choices for the winner of the final game (winner of previous game vs #1).\nThe total number of orders is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have $2$ choices for who wins the first game, and that uniquely determines $5^{\\text{th}}$ place. Then there are $2$ choices for a next game and that uniquely determines $4^{\\text{th}}$ place, followed by $2$ choices for the next game that uniquely determines $3^{\\text{rd}}$ place. Finally, there are $2$ choices for the last game, which uniquely determines both $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ places, since the winner is $1^{\\text{st}}$ and the loser is $2^{\\text{nd}}$. Thus the number of possible orders is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{16}$."
