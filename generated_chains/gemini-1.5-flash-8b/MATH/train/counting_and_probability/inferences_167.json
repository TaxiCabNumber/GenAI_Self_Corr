At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of different gender?",
        "inference": "1. To choose a president, we can choose from 10 boys or 10 girls.  There are 10 + 10 = 20 choices.\n2. Once the president is chosen, there are 10 boys or 10 girls left to choose from for the vice-president, depending on the gender of the president.\n3. If the president is a boy, there are 10 choices for the vice-president (girls). If the president is a girl, there are 10 choices for the vice-president (boys).\n4. Total ways = (10 boys * 10 girls) + (10 girls * 10 boys) = 100 + 100 = 200\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$\n",
