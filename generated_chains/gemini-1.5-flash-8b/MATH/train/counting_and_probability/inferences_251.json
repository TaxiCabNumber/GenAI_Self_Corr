I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",

        "ground_truth": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants.

        "inference": "There are 5 letters.  We need to find the number of 4-letter words that can be formed using these 5 letters, with at least one consonant.  We don't know the letters.  However, if we assume the letters are distinct, the total number of 4-letter words is $5^4=625$.\nLet's assume that two letters are vowels, and three letters are consonants.  If we have two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (B, C, D), then the number of words with only vowels is $2^4=16$.\nThe number of words with at least one consonant is the total number of 4-letter words minus the number of words with only vowels, which is $5^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 16 = 609$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{609}$",
