I hope it is correct.'\nEach unit square of a 3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For each square, either color is equally likely to be used. The probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red square is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
