At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",

Number of gray-bottomed sock pairs: $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$.\n4. Number of white-bottomed sock pairs: $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$.\n5.
