(4,0,0): There is only 1 way to do this.\n4. (3,1,0): There is $\\binom{4}{3,1,0}/(1!1!1!) = 4!/(3!1!0!) = 4!/3! = 4$ ways. But since balls and boxes are indistinguishable, this needs to be divided by 2 to account for the symmetry. 4/2 = 2 ways.\n5. (2,2,0): There is $\\binom{4}{2,2,0}/(2!2!0!) = 4!/(2!2!0!) = 6$ ways. Since balls and boxes are indistinguishable, this must be divided by 2 for the symmetry of the (2,2,0). 6/2 = 3 ways.\n6. (2,1,1): There is $\\binom{4}{2,1,1}/(2!1!1!) = 4!/(2!1!1!) = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$ ways. But we need to divide by 3! since the boxes are indistinguishable, 12/3! = 12/6 = 2 ways.\n7. Summing the ways gives 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
