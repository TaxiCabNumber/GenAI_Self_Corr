At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven eight distinguishable rings, let $n$ be the number of possible five-ring arrangements on the four fingers (not the thumb) of one hand. The order of rings on each finger is significant, but it is not required that each finger have a ring. Find the leftmost three nonzero digits of $n$.\n",

We want to arrange 5 of them on 4 fingers.\nWe have 4 fingers, and we want to arrange 5 rings on them.\nWe can think of this as distributing 5 indistinguishable items into 4 distinguishable boxes, with replacement. This is equivalent to the stars and bars problem.\nThe number of ways to distribute $n$ items into $k$ boxes is given by $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$ if the items are indistinguishable.\nIn our case, we have 5 rings (items) and 4 fingers (boxes).\nHowever, the rings are distinguishable.

        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{8}{5}$ ways to choose the rings, and there are $5!$ distinct arrangements to order the rings [we order them so that the first ring is the bottom-most on the first finger that actually has a ring, and so forth]. The number of ways to distribute the rings among the fingers is equivalent the number of ways we can drop five balls into 4 urns, or similarly dropping five balls into four compartments split by three dividers. The number of ways to arrange those dividers and balls is just $\\binom {8}{3}$.\nMultiplying gives the answer: $\\binom{8}{5}\\binom{8}{3}5! = 376320$, and the three leftmost digits are $\\boxed{376}$."
