If you pick three jellybeans from the bowl at random and without replacement, what is the probability that exactly two will be red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "First, we consider how many total sets of three jellybeans we can select, which is very simply ${10 \\choose 3} = 120$, if we treat all 10 jellybeans as distinct. Now, if we have exactly 2 red jellybeans, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of red jellybeans, and $5+1 = 6$ choices for the third non-red jellybean. So, there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ successful outcomes. So our probability is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 6}{120} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$."
