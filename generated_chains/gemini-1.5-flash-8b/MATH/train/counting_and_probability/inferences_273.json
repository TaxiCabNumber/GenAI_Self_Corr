At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy club has 25 members.  In how many ways can I choose members to form a 4-person executive committee?",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose a 4-person executive committee from a group of 25 members is given by the combination formula.  The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.  In this case, $n = 25$ and $k = 4$.\n\n$\\binom{25}{4} = \\frac{25!}{4!(25-4)!} = \\frac{25!}{4!21!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22}{24} = 25 \\times 23 \\times 22 = 12650$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12650}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Choosing a committee is a combination, since the order does not matter. We are choosing a 4-person committee from 25 people, so there are 25 ways to pick the first person, 24 ways to pick the second person, etc.  However, we must divide by $4!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22}{4!}=\\boxed{12,\\!650}$."
