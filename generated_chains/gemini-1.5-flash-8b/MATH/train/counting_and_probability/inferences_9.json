        "inference": "The region where John catches the train is given by $T \\le J \\le T+20$.  The sample space is a square with vertices (0,0), (60,0), (60,60), (0,60).  The area of the sample space is $60^2 = 3600$.\nThe region where John catches the train is the area between the lines $y = x$ and $y = x+20$ within the square.  The portion of $y=x$ inside the square is from (0,0) to (60,60). The portion of $y=x+20$ inside the square is from (0,20) to (40,60). Thus we need the area between the lines.\n\nThe area of the region under $y = x+20$ and above $y = x$ from $x=0$ to $x=40$ is a trapezoid with bases 40 and 20 and height 40, with area $\\frac{1}{2}(40)(40+20) = 1200$.\nThe area of the region under $y=x+20$ and above $y=x$ from $x=40$ to $x=60$ is a triangle with base $60-40 = 20$ and height $20$, which is a rectangle and a triangle.  \nThe area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(20)(20) = 200$.\nSo the total area is $1200+200 = 1400$.\nThe total area of the square is $60^2=3600$.\nThe required probability is $\\frac{1400}{3600} = \\frac{14}{36} = \\frac{7}{18}$.\n\n\nThe region above $y=x$ and below $y = x+20$ is a trapezoid with vertices (0,20), (40,60), (40,40), (0,0).\nArea = (1/2) * (60-0)*(60-0) - (1/2)(40-20)*(40-20) = 1800 - 800 = 1000\nHowever, the trapezoid is wrong.\n\nThe region is the area between $y=x$ and $y=x+20$ in a 60 x 60 square.  The portion of the region under $y=x$ lies between (0,0) to (40,40).\nArea of the whole square is $60^2 = 3600$.\nThe area of the region where the condition is met is $1/2 (60)(60) - 1/2 (40)(40) = 1800 - 800 = 1000$.\n\n\nThe area where John catches the train is $\\int_0^{40} x \\, dx + \\int_{40}^{60} (x+20) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} (40^2) + [(\\frac{1}{2} (x^2) + 20x)|_{40}^{60}] = 800 + [(1800+1200)-(800+800)] = 800 + (3000-1600) = 800 + 1400 = 2200$\nThere is a mistake somewhere.\nThe correct area is $\\frac{1}{2}(60 \\times 60) + \\frac{1}{2}(20 \\times 20) - \\frac{1}{2}(40 \\times 40) = 1800 + 200 - 800 = 1200$\n\nThe probability is $\\frac{1200}{3600} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n\n$\\frac{2200-1600}{3600} = \\frac{600}{3600}$\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7/18}$",
