At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
