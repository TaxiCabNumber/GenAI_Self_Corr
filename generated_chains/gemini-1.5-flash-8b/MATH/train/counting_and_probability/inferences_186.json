At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 5 books, two of which are identical copies of the same math book (and all of the rest of the books are different).  In how many ways can I arrange them on a shelf?",

        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to arrange the books if they are unique, but two are identical so we must divide by $2!$ for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{2!} = \\boxed{60}$."
