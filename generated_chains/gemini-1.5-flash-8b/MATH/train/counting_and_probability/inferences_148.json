At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider a regular octagon.  How many triangles can be formed whose vertices are the vertices of the octagon?",

(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3! 5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{336}{6} = 56$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$."
