        "ground_truth": "First, the $2002$th positive even integer is $4004$, so we are looking for the number of digits used when the positive even integers less than or equal to $4004$ are written. Split this problem into cases. It's easy to see that there are four positive even integers with one digit: $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. Beginning with $10$ and ending with $98$, there are $\\frac{98-10}{2} +1 = 45$ positive even numbers with two digits.

Finally, beginning with $1000$ and ending with $4004$, there are $\\frac{4004-1000}{2} + 1 = 1503$ positive even numbers with four digits.
