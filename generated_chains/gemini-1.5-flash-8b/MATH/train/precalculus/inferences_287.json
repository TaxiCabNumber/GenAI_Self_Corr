The planes are parallel.\nTo find the distance between the parallel planes, we can find the distance from a point on the first plane to the second plane.  Let $P_1$ be a point on the first plane. From $x+2y-2z+1=0$, we can set $x=0, y=0$, which gives $-2z+1=0$, so $z=\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus $P_1=(0,0,\\frac{1}{2})$ is on the first plane.\nThe distance between the planes is the perpendicular distance from a point on one plane to the other plane. We use the formula for the distance between a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and a plane $ax+by+cz+d=0$ as $\\frac{|ax_0+by_0+cz_0+d|}{\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}$.\nIn this case, the point is $P_1 = (0,0, \\frac{1}{2})$ and the plane is $x + 2y - 2z + \\frac{5}{2} = 0$.\nThe distance is\n$$ \\frac{|1(0) + 2(0) - 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + \\frac{5}{2}|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + (-2)^2}} = \\frac{|0 - 1 + \\frac{5}{2}|}{\\sqrt{1 + 4 + 4}} = \\frac{|\\frac{3}{2}|}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
