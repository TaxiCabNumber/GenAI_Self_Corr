When we apply the matrix\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\]to $S,$ we obtain the region $S'.$  Find the area of $S'.$",

The determinant of the matrix\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\]is $(2)(-3) - (1)(7) = -6 - 7 = -13$.  The absolute value of the determinant is $|-13| = 13$.
