        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $x+y = 10$ and $2x+y = 13$, evaluate $x^2-y^2$.",
        "inference": "From the first equation, $x+y = 10$, we can isolate $y$ to get $y = 10 - x$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, $2x+y=13$, we get $2x + (10-x) = 13$.\nSimplifying, $x + 10 = 13$, so $x = 3$.\nSubstituting $x = 3$ into the equation $x+y=10$, we get $3+y=10$, so $y=7$.\nNow we want to evaluate $x^2-y^2$.\nSubstituting $x=3$ and $y=7$ into the expression $x^2-y^2$, we get $3^2 - 7^2 = 9 - 49 = -40$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-40}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting the first given equation from the second equation, we have $2x+y-(x+y)=13-10 \\Rightarrow x=3$. Plugging the value of $x$ into the first given equation to solve for $y$, we have $y=10-x=7$. Thus, $x^2-y^2=3^2-7^2=\\boxed{-40}$."
