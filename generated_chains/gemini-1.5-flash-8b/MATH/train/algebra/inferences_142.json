At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k > 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
        "inference": "Since $k > 0$ and $x \\ge 1$, we have $x^k \\ge 1^k = 1$.  Thus, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is 1.\nAs $x$ increases, $x^k$ also increases.  There is no upper bound for $x^k$ as $x$ goes to infinity.  Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $[1, \\infty)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because $k > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ increases without bound.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values greater than or equal to 1, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$."
