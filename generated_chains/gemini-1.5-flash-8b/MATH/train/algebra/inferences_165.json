We can factor the quadratic:\n$(x + 7)(x - 5) = 0$\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:\n$x + 7 = 0 \\implies x = -7$\n$x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5$\nThe solutions are $x = -7$ and $x = 5$.\nThe product of the solutions is $(-7)(5) = -35$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-35}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
