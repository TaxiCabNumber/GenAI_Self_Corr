        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent basketball game, Shenille attempted only three-point shots and two-point shots.  She was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots and $30\\%$ of her two-point shots.  Shenille attempted $30$ shots.  How many points did she score?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of three-point shots attempted and $y$ be the number of two-point shots attempted. We are given that $x+y=30$.\nShenille was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots. So, the number of points scored from three-point shots is $0.2x \\times 3 = 0.6x$.\nShenille was successful on $30\\%$ of her two-point shots. So, the number of points scored from two-point shots is $0.3y \\times 2 = 0.6y$.\nThe total points scored is $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$. Since $x+y=30$, the total points scored is $0.6(30)=18$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$.  We know that $x+y=30$.   We need to evaluate $(0.2\\cdot3)x +(0.3\\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\\%$ of them.\n\nSimplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$.  Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \\boxed{18}$."
