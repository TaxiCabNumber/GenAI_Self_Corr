After how many bounces will the ball first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot?",
        "inference": "1. Initial height: 1000 feet\n2. First bounce: 1000 * 0.5 = 500 feet\n3. Second bounce: 500 * 0.5 = 250 feet\n4. Third bounce: 250 * 0.5 = 125 feet\n5. The height after the nth bounce is given by the formula: $1000 \\times (0.5)^n$\n6. We want to find the smallest integer n such that $1000 \\times (0.5)^n < 1$\n7. $\\frac{1000}{2^n} < 1$\n8. $1000 < 2^n$\n9. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides: $log_2(1000) < n$\n10. $log_2(1000) \\approx 9.96578$\n11. The smallest integer greater than 9.96578 is 10.\n12. Therefore, after 10 bounces, the maximum height will first be less than 1 foot.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have a geometric sequence with first term 1000 and common ratio $1/2$. Any term in this sequence can be represented as $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k=500$, or the height of the $k=1^\\text{st}$ bounce). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k<1$.
