        "inference": "The problem states that the square of an integer is 182 greater than the integer itself.  This translates to the equation $n^2 = n + 182$.  Rearranging to form a quadratic equation, we get $n^2 - n - 182 = 0$. Factoring, we have $(n-14)(n+13) = 0$. This gives us two possible solutions: $n = 14$ and $n = -13$. The problem asks for the sum of the integers, which is $14 + (-13) = 1$.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$\n",
