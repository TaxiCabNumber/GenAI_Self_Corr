At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy works for 36 hours per week for 10 weeks during the summer, making $\\$3000$. If she works for 30 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$3000$, how many hours per week must she work?",
        "inference": "Amy worked 36 hours/week * 10 weeks = 360 hours total during the summer.\nHer summer pay was $3000.\nSo her hourly rate is $3000 / 360 hours = $8.33/hour (approximately).\nAmy needs to make another $3000 during the school year.\nLet 'x' be the number of hours she needs to work per week during the school year.\nShe works for 30 weeks during the school year.\nSo, 30 weeks * x hours/week = 30x hours.\nTo make $3000, she needs 30x hours * $8.33/hour = $3000.\n30x * $8.33 = $3000\n250x = 3000\nx = 3000/250\nx = 12 hours/week\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ hours. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 3 times as many weeks, she can work 3 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
