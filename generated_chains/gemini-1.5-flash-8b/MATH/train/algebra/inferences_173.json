        "inference": "The given expression is $x^2 - 20x + 36$.\nWe want to complete the square for $x^2 - 20x$.\nWe take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $-\\frac{20}{2} = -10$, and square it to get $(-10)^2 = 100$.\nWe add and subtract 100 to complete the square:\n$x^2 - 20x = x^2 - 20x + 100 - 100 = (x^2 - 20x + 100) - 100 = (x-10)^2 - 100$.\nNow we substitute this back into the original expression:\n$x^2 - 20x + 36 = (x-10)^2 - 100 + 36 = (x-10)^2 - 64$.\nComparing this to the form $(x+b)^2 + c$, we have $x-10 = x+b$, so $b = -10$.\nAlso, $-64 = c$.\nThus, $b+c = -10 + (-64) = -74$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-74}$",
