At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat number can be added to both the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{3}{5}$ so that the resulting fraction will be equivalent to $\\frac{5}{6}$?",

        "ground_truth": "We seek the number $n$ such that $\\frac{3+n}{5+n} = \\frac{5}{6}$.  Multiplying both sides by $5+n$ and by 6 gives $(3+n)(6) = 5(5+n)$.  Expanding both sides gives $18 + 6n = 25 + 5n$.  Simplifying this equation gives $n = \\boxed{7}$."
