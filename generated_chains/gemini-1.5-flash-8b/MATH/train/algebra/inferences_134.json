I hope it is correct.'\nIf the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, then what is the value of $a$ when $b=12-5a$?",
        "inference": "1. We are given that the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, which means $\\frac{b}{a} = 3$.  This implies $b = 3a$.\n\n2. We are also given that $b = 12 - 5a$.\n\n3. Now we can set the two expressions for $b$ equal to each other: $3a = 12 - 5a$.\n\n4. Add $5a$ to both sides: $3a + 5a = 12$\n\n5. Simplify: $8a = 12$\n\n6.

        "ground_truth": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable.
