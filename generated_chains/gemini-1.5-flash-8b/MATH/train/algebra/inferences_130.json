        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven the function $f(x)=3x^3+2$, find the value of $x$ so that $f^{-1}(x)=4$.",
        "inference": "1. To find $f^{-1}(x)$, we need to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ in the equation $y = 3x^3 + 2$.\n\n2. Subtract 2 from both sides: $y - 2 = 3x^3$\n\n3. Divide both sides by 3: $\\frac{y - 2}{3} = x^3$\n\n4. Take the cube root of both sides: $x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y - 2}{3}}$\n\n5. Thus, $f^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y - 2}{3}}$.\n\n6. Now we are given that $f^{-1}(x) = 4$, so we set $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x - 2}{3}} = 4$.\n\n7. Cube both sides: $\\frac{x - 2}{3} = 4^3 = 64$\n\n8. Multiply both sides by 3: $x - 2 = 64 \\times 3 = 192$\n\n9. Add 2 to both sides: $x = 192 + 2 = 194$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{194}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The equation $f^{-1}(x)=4$ is equivalent to $x=f(4)$.  Therefore we want to find the value $f(4)$. We compute $f(4) = 3 \\cdot 4^3 + 2 = \\boxed{194}$."
