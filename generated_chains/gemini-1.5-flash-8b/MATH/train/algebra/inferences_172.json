At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -16t^2 + 80t$ describes the height (in feet) of a projectile launched from the ground at 80 feet per second. At what $t$ will the projectile reach 36 feet in height for the first time? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.",
