        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAfter traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?",
        "inference": "Let $F$ be the taxi fare and $d$ be the distance traveled.\nWe are given that the taxi fare is directly proportional to the distance traveled. This means that $F = kd$, where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n\nWe are given that Ann is charged $\\$120$ for traveling 50 miles. So, we have $120 = k \\times 50$.\nSolving for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{120}{50} = \\frac{12}{5} = 2.4$.\nNow, we want to find the fare if Ann had traveled 70 miles. We have $F = 2.4 \\times 70 = 168$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$168}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ equal the cost of a 70 mile taxi ride. Since we know that Ann was charged $120 dollars a 50 mile taxi ride, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{120}{50}=\\frac{d}{70}$. If we solve for $d$ by multiplying both sides by 70, we find that $d=\\left(\\frac{120}{50}\\right)(70)=\\boxed{168}$ dollars."
