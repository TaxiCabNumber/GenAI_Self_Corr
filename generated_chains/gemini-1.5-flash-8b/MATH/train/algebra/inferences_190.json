        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
        "inference": "1. Let $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$ represent the distances hiked on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n2. We are given that $d_1 + d_2 = 22$.\n3. We are given that the average of $d_2$ and $d_3$ is 13 miles per day, so $\\frac{d_2 + d_3}{2} = 13$, which means $d_2 + d_3 = 26$.\n4. We are given that $d_3 + d_4 = 30$.\n5. We are given that $d_1 + d_3 = 26$.\n\n6. From equation (2), we have $d_2 = 26 - d_3$. Substituting this into equation (1), we get $d_1 + (26 - d_3) = 22$, which gives $d_1 - d_3 = -4$.\n7. From equation (5), we have $d_3 = 26 - d_1$. Substituting this into $d_1 - d_3 = -4$, we get $d_1 - (26 - d_1) = -4$, which simplifies to $2d_1 - 26 = -4$, giving $2d_1 = 22$, so $d_1 = 11$.\n8. From equation (5), $d_3 = 26 - d_1 = 26 - 11 = 15$.\n9. From equation (4), $d_4 = 30 - d_3 = 30 - 15 = 15$.\n10. The total length of the trail is $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 11 + d_2 + 15 + 15 = 41 + d_2$.\n11. From equation (1), $d_2 = 22 - d_1 = 22 - 11 = 11$.\n12. The total length of the trail is $11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long."
