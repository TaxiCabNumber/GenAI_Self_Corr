        "inference": "The number of logs in each row forms an arithmetic sequence with first term $a_1 = 12$ and common difference $d = -1$.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by\n$S_n = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}$\nIn this case, $n=10$, $a_1 = 12$, and $a_{10} = 3$.\n$S_{10} = \\frac{10(12 + 3)}{2} = \\frac{10(15)}{2} = 5(15) = 75$\nThere are 75 logs in the stack.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$\n",

The value of the sum is $\\frac{15}{2}\\cdot10=15\\cdot5=75$, so there are $\\boxed{75}$ logs in the stack."
