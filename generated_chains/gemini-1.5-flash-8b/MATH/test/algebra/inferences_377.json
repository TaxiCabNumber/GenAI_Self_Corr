        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $\\displaystyle\\frac{n+5}{n-3} = 2$ what is the value of $n$?",
        "inference": "1. Multiply both sides of the equation by (n-3):\n   n + 5 = 2(n-3)\n2. Distribute the 2:\n   n + 5 = 2n - 6\n3. Subtract n from both sides:\n   5 = n - 6\n4. Add 6 to both sides:\n   11 = n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$ . I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides by $n-3$, we have $n+5 = 2(n-3)$.  Expanding gives $n+5 = 2n - 6$, and solving this equation gives $n=\\boxed{11}$."
