At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMonica, who is 5 feet tall, is standing next to a pine tree that casts a shadow 34 feet long. If Monica's shadow is 2 feet long, how tall is the pine tree, in feet?",
        "inference": "Let Monica's height be $h_M$ and the length of her shadow be $s_M$.\nLet the height of the pine tree be $h_T$ and the length of the pine tree's shadow be $s_T$.\nWe are given that $h_M = 5$ feet and $s_M = 2$ feet.\nWe are also given that $s_T = 34$ feet.\nWe can use similar triangles to relate the height of Monica and the height of the pine tree to the lengths of their shadows.\nSince the triangles formed by Monica, her shadow, and the line connecting the top of her head to the tip of her shadow, and the pine tree, its shadow, and the line connecting the top of the tree to the tip of its shadow, are similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.\nThus, $\\frac{h_M}{s_M} = \\frac{h_T}{s_T}$.\nPlugging in the given values, we get $\\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{h_T}{34}$.\nNow, we solve for $h_T$.\n$h_T = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 34$\n$h_T = 5 \\times 17$\n$h_T = 85$ feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{85}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Monica's shadow is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as she is tall, so the pine tree's shadow is also $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as the tree is tall. Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, the pine tree itself is $34\\div \\dfrac{2}{5}=(34)\\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{85\\text{ feet}}$ tall."
