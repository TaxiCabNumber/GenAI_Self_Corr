        "inference": "1. The triangle has vertices at $(0,5)$, $(k,\\frac{2}{3}k+5)$, and $(k,0)$.\n2. The base of the triangle is along the x-axis, with length $k$.\n3. The height of the triangle is the $y$-coordinate of the point where $y = \\frac{2}{3}x+5$ intersects with $x=k$, which is $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$.\n4. The area of the triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height = \\frac{1}{2} \\times k \\times (\\frac{2}{3}k+5) = \\frac{1}{3}k^2 + \\frac{5}{2}k$.\n5. We are given that the area is less than $20$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}k^2 + \\frac{5}{2}k < 20$.\n6. Multiplying by 6 to eliminate fractions, $2k^2 + 15k < 120$.\n7. Rearranging the inequality, $2k^2 + 15k - 120 < 0$.\n8. To find the roots of $2k^2 + 15k - 120 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n$k = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{15^2 - 4(2)(-120)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{225 + 960}}{4} = \\frac{-15 \\pm \\sqrt{1185}}{4} = \\frac{-15 \\pm 5\\sqrt{47.4}}{4}$.\n9. The approximate values of the roots are $k_1 \\approx \\frac{-15 - 34.4}{4} \\approx -12.35$ and $k_2 \\approx \\frac{-15 + 34.4}{4} \\approx 4.85$.\n10. Since the parabola $2k^2+15k-120$ opens upwards, the values of $k$ that satisfy the inequality are between the roots, i.e., $-12.35 < k < 4.85$.\n11. The integral values of $k$ are $-12, -11, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.\n12. The sum of the possible integral values of $k$ is $-12 - 11 - ... - 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = \\sum_{i=-12}^4 i = \\frac{(-12+4)(4-(-12)+1)}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\times 17}{2} = -68$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-68}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since two of the lines that are the edges of the triangle are known, their intersection must be one of the vertices of the triangle. So we have $y=0$ (the $x$-axis) and $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$. Solving this equation, we find $0=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$, or $-5=\\frac{2}{3}x$, so $x=-\\frac{15}{2}$. Thus one of the vertices of the triangle is $\\left(-\\frac{15}{2},0\\right)$. The other vertices lie on the line $x=k$, so they take the form $(k,0)$ and $\\left(k,\\frac{2}{3}k+5\\right)$. The area of the triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. The height is $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$, since the base is along the $x$-axis, and the base is $k-\\left(-\\frac{15}{2}\\right)=k+\\frac{15}{2}$.

But the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x+5$ will be below the $x$-axis so the value $\\frac{2}{3}k+5$ will be negative as well. Half their product, the area, will thus be positive as desired.

The decimal approximations of the roots are $-15.25\\ldots$ and $0.25\\ldots$, respectively, so we have $-15.25<k<0.25$. Since we are interested in values of $k$ for which $k$ is an integer, we have $-15\\le k\\le 0$. The problem asks for the sum of all integral values of $k$, so we must sum the integers from $-15$ to $0$.
