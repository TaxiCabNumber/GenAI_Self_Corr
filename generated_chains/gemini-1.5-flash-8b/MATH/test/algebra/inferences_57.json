        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear.  We are given $x(x+5) = -n$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$.

The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(1)(n) = 25 - 4n$.  We need $25 - 4n < 0$, which means $25 < 4n$, so $n > \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25$.  Since $n$ is an integer, $n$ must be 7, 8, 9, or 10.
