At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe combined weight of three basset hounds is $185$ pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds. How many pounds does the largest dog weigh?",
        "inference": "Let the weights of the three basset hounds be $w_1, w_2, w_3$, where $w_1 \\le w_2 \\le w_3$.\nWe are given that $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 185$.\nWe are also given that $w_1 = w_2$ and $w_3 - w_1 = 20$.\nSince $w_1 = w_2$, we have $w_1 + w_1 + w_3 = 185$, which simplifies to $2w_1 + w_3 = 185$.\nAlso, $w_3 - w_1 = 20$.\nFrom $w_3 - w_1 = 20$, we get $w_3 = w_1 + 20$.\nSubstituting $w_3 = w_1 + 20$ into $2w_1 + w_3 = 185$, we get $2w_1 + (w_1 + 20) = 185$.\nThis simplifies to $3w_1 + 20 = 185$.\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get $3w_1 = 165$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get $w_1 = 55$.\nSince $w_3 = w_1 + 20$, we have $w_3 = 55 + 20 = 75$.\nThe largest dog weighs 75 pounds.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$",
        "ground_truth": "Let the three basset hounds weigh $a$, $a$, and $b$ pounds, where $a < b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds."
