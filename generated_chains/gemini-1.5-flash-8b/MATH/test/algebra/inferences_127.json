At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat power of 4 is equal to 8? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "To find the power of 4 that equals 8, we need to solve for x in the equation 4<sup>x</sup> = 8.\n\nFirst, rewrite 4 and 8 as powers of 2: 4 = 2<sup>2</sup> and 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>.  Substituting these into the equation, we get (2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>x</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup>.\n\nUsing the power of a power rule, (a<sup>m</sup>)<sup>n</sup> = a<sup>mn</sup>, we have 2<sup>2x</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup>.\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal: 2x = 3.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 3/2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We are asked to solve $4^x=8$ for $x$.  Writing $4$ as $2^2$ and $8$ as $2^3$, the equation becomes $(2^2)^x=2^3$.  The left-hand side simplifies to $2^{2x}$, so we may set exponents equal to find $2x=3$, which implies $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
