At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the function $j(x)$ is defined only on domain $[-1,2]$, and is defined on this domain by the formula $$j(x) = 2x^2+1,$$ then what is the range of $j(x)$? Express your answer as an interval or as a union of intervals.",
        "inference": "1. The function $j(x) = 2x^2 + 1$ is a parabola opening upwards.  The vertex of the parabola occurs at $x = 0$, and $j(0) = 2(0)^2 + 1 = 1$.\n2. Since the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value of $j(x)$ on the interval $[-1, 2]$ is the $y$-value at the vertex, which is 1.\n3. The maximum value of $j(x)$ occurs at one of the endpoints of the interval $[-1, 2]$.\n   - At $x = -1$, $j(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$.\n   - At $x = 2$, $j(2) = 2(2)^2 + 1 = 2(4) + 1 = 9$.\n4. The maximum value is 9, and the minimum value is 1.\n5. The range of $j(x)$ is the interval $[1, 9]$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{[1, 9]}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $x^2$ assumes every value from $0$ to $4$, inclusive, as $x$ varies throughout the interval $[-1,2]$. Therefore, $j(x)$ assumes every value from $2(0)+1=1$ to $2(4)+1=9$ (and no other values). The range of $j(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,9]}$."
