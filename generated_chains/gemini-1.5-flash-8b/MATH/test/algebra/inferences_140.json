At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence starts with the term 2222. Each succeeding term is found by adding 1010 to the previous term. What is the sum of the sixth and seventh terms?",
        "inference": "1. First term: 2222\n2. Second term: 2222 + 1010 = 3232\n3. Third term: 3232 + 1010 = 4242\n4. Fourth term: 4242 + 1010 = 5252\n5. Fifth term: 5252 + 1010 = 6262\n6. Sixth term: 6262 + 1010 = 7272\n7. Seventh term: 7272 + 1010 = 8282\n8. Sum of sixth and seventh terms: 7272 + 8282 = 15554\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15554}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of the sequence is $2222+1010(n-1)$.  Therefore, the sum of the sixth and seventh terms is $2222+1010(5)+2222+1010(6)=4444+1010(11)=4444+11110=\\boxed{15554}$."
