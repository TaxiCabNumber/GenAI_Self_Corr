At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials in $t$, what is the degree of $p(t)\\cdot q(t)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of a product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.  Since $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are both seventh-degree polynomials, their degrees are 7.  The degree of $p(t) \\cdot q(t)$ is $7 + 7 = 14$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The $t^7$ terms multiply to a $t^{14}$ term.  All the other terms multiply to terms of lesser degree, so the degree of the product of polynomials is $\\boxed{14}$."
