I hope it is correct.'\nAn airplane climbs 100 feet during the first second after takeoff.  In each succeeding second it climbs 100 feet more than it climbed during the previous second.  How many  seconds does it take for the plane to reach an altitude of   12,000 feet above its takeoff height?",
        "inference": "Let $h_n$ be the altitude reached after $n$ seconds.\nIn the first second, the plane climbs 100 feet. So $h_1 = 100$.\nIn the second second, the plane climbs 100 + 100 = 200 feet. So $h_2 = h_1 + 200 = 100 + 200 = 300$.\nIn the third second, the plane climbs 100 + 200 = 300 feet. So $h_3 = h_2 + 300 = 300 + 300 = 600$.\nThe altitude after $n$ seconds is given by the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$h_n = 100 + 200 + 300 + \\dots + n(100) = 100(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n) = 100 \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 50n(n+1)$.\nWe want to find $n$ such that $h_n = 12000$.\n$50n(n+1) = 12000$\n$n(n+1) = 240$\n$n^2 + n - 240 = 0$\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to -240 and add to 1.\nThe numbers are 15 and -16.\n$n^2 + 16n - 15n - 240 = 0$\n$n(n+16) - 15(n+16) = 0$\n$(n-15)(n+16) = 0$\nSince $n$ must be positive, $n = 15$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "After $t$ seconds, the airplane's altitude (in feet) is $100 + 200 + \\dots + 100t = 100(1 + 2 + \\dots + t) = 100 \\cdot t(t + 1)/2 = 50t(t + 1)$.
