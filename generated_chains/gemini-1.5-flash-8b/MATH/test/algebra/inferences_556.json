        "inference": "1. Since the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $1$.  The axis of symmetry of a parabola $y = ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. Thus, $-\\frac{b}{2a} = 1$, which means $b = -2a$.\n\n2. The parabola goes through the points $(-1,3)$ and $(2,-2)$. Substituting these points into the equation $y = ax^2+bx+c$, we get the following system of equations:\n   $3 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\Rightarrow 3 = a - b + c$\n   $-2 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c \\Rightarrow -2 = 4a + 2b + c$\n\n3. Substitute $b = -2a$ into the two equations from step 2:\n   $3 = a - (-2a) + c \\Rightarrow 3 = 3a + c$\n   $-2 = 4a + 2(-2a) + c \\Rightarrow -2 = 4a - 4a + c \\Rightarrow -2 = c$\n\n4. Substitute $c = -2$ into the equation $3 = 3a + c$ to find $a$:\n   $3 = 3a + (-2) \\Rightarrow 3 = 3a - 2 \\Rightarrow 5 = 3a \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{5}{3}$\n   Since $b = -2a$, $b = -2\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{10}{3}$.\n\n5. Now we have the equation $y = \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x - 2$.  To find the roots, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$:\n   $0 = \\frac{5}{3}x^2 - \\frac{10}{3}x - 2$.\n   Multiplying by 3 to clear the fractions:\n   $0 = 5x^2 - 10x - 6$\n   Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we get\n   $x = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4(5)(-6)}}{2(5)} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 120}}{10} = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{220}}{10} = \\frac{10 \\pm 2\\sqrt{55}}{10} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{55}}{5}$.\n\n6. The greater root is $\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{55}}{5}$. Since we are given the greater root is $\\sqrt{n}+1$, we have $\\sqrt{55} = \\sqrt{n}$, so $n=55$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{55}$",
        "ground_truth": "Rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=1$, so $h=1$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-1)^2+k$.
