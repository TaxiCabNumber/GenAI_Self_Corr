        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $j$ is perpendicular to $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. What is the slope of line $j$?",
        "inference": "1. Rewrite the given equation in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n   $\\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{2x}{5} = 2$\n   $\\frac{y}{3} = -\\frac{2}{5}x + 2$\n   $y = -\\frac{6}{5}x + 6$\n\n2. Identify the slope of the given line. The slope (m) is the coefficient of x, which is $-\\frac{6}{5}$.\n\n3. Find the slope of the line perpendicular to the given line. The slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope m is $-\\frac{1}{m}$.\n\n4. Calculate the slope of line j:\n   $m_{perpendicular} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{6}{5}} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the slope of $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. We change the form to slope-intercept form. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $y+\\frac{6x}{5}=6$. Moving the $x$ to the right, we get $y=-\\frac{6x}{5}+6$. The slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $j$ is the opposite reciprocal of $-\\frac{6}{5}$ which is $\\boxed{\\frac56}$."
