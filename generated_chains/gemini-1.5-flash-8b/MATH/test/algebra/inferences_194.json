        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$1000$ in one-time equipment fees and then it costs $\\$0.50$ for each widget it makes. It sells widgets at a price of $\\$2.75$ per widget. What is the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of widgets.\nThe cost of producing $x$ widgets is $1000 + 0.5x$.\nThe revenue from selling $x$ widgets is $2.75x$.\nThe company makes a profit when the revenue is greater than the cost, i.e., $2.75x > 1000 + 0.5x$.\n$2.75x - 0.5x > 1000$\n$2.25x > 1000$\n$x > \\frac{1000}{2.25} = \\frac{1000 \\times 4}{9} = \\frac{4000}{9} \\approx 444.44$\nSince the number of widgets must be a whole number, the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit is 445.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{445}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of widgets $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue. \\begin{align*}\n1000+.5n&<2.75n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n1000&<2.25n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n444.\\overline{4}=\\frac{1000}{2.25}&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $444.\\overline{4}$ is 445, so the company has to sell at least $\\boxed{445}$ widgets to make a profit."
