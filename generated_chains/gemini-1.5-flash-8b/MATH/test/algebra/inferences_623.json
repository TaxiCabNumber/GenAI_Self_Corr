At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn is 31 years younger than his dad. The sum of their ages is 53 years. How many years old is John's dad?",
        "inference": "Let John's age be J and his dad's age be D.\nJ = D - 31  (John is 31 years younger than his dad)\nJ + D = 53 (The sum of their ages is 53)\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second equation:\n(D - 31) + D = 53\n2D - 31 = 53\n2D = 53 + 31\n2D = 84\nD = 84 / 2\nD = 42\n\nJohn's dad is 42 years old.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{42}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old."
