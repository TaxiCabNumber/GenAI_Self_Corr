At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix construction workers that work at the same rate can build a house in 1.5 days.  How long does it take 15 construction workers, working at the same rate, to finish building a house?  Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",

        "ground_truth": "The number of workers is inversely proportional to the amount of time it takes to build a house.  Thus $$\\text{number of workers} \\times \\text{time} = \\text{constant}.$$Using this, we have that $6 \\cdot 1.5 = 15 \\cdot t \\Rightarrow t = .6$.  As a fraction in lowest terms this is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$."
