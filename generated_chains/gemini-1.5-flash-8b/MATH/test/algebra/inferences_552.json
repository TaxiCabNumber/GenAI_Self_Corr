At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne day, I decide to run to the park. On the way there, I run at a rate of $x^2$ miles per hour for $3$ hours. On the way back, I take the same path and jog at a slower rate of $16 - 4x$ miles per hour so that it takes me $4$ hours to get home. Given that $x > 0$, what is $x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
