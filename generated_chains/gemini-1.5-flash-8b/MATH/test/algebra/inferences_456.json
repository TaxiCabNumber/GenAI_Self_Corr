        "inference": "The graph of $y = ax^2 + bx - 6$ is completely below the $x$-axis. This means the quadratic $ax^2 + bx - 6$ is negative for all real values of $x$.\n\nFor a quadratic to always be negative, the parabola must open downward, so $a < 0$, and the discriminant must be negative.\nThe discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = a$, $b = b$, and $c = -6$.  Thus $b^2 - 4(a)(-6) < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 + 24a < 0$.\n\nWe are given that $a^2 = 49$, so $a = 7$ or $a = -7$.\nSince the parabola must open downward, we have $a = -7$.\nNow substitute $a=-7$ into the inequality $b^2 + 24a < 0$:\n$b^2 + 24(-7) < 0$\n$b^2 - 168 < 0$\n$b^2 < 168$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $|b| < \\sqrt{168}$, which is $|b| < \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 42} = 2\\sqrt{42}$.\nThis means $-\\sqrt{168} < b < \\sqrt{168}$.
