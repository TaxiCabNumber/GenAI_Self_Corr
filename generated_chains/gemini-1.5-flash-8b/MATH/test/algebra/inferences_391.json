        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZeno had to paint a $15^\\prime \\times 15^\\prime$ square floor. He decided that each day he would paint half of the unpainted part from the previous day until there was only one square foot or less left, in which case he would stay and finish the job that day. Using this strategy, how many days did it take Zeno to paint the entire floor?",
        "inference": "1. Day 1: Paints half of the floor, leaving $15^2 / 2 = 112.5$ square feet unpainted.\n2. Day 2: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $112.5 / 2 = 56.25$ square feet unpainted.\n3. Day 3: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $56.25 / 2 = 28.125$ square feet unpainted.\n4. Day 4: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $28.125 / 2 = 14.0625$ square feet unpainted.\n5. Day 5: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $14.0625 / 2 = 7.03125$ square feet unpainted.\n6. Day 6: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $7.03125 / 2 = 3.515625$ square feet unpainted.\n7. Day 7: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $3.515625 / 2 = 1.7578125$ square feet unpainted.\n8. Day 8: Paints half of the remaining unpainted area, leaving $1.7578125 / 2 = 0.87890625$ square feet unpainted.\n\nThe unpainted area is decreasing by half each day.  We can calculate the number of days it takes to paint a 15' x 15' square floor by determining when the remaining unpainted area is less than or equal to 1 square foot.\n\nThe remaining area after n days is $15^2 (1/2)^n = 225 (1/2)^n$.\nWe want to find the smallest integer n such that $225 (1/2)^n \\le 1$.\n$ (1/2)^n \\le 1/225$\n$ 2^n \\ge 225$\n$ 2^7 = 128, 2^8 = 256$\n$2^8 \\ge 225$\nSo $n = 8$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$",
        "ground_truth": "We focus on the portion of the floor that is left unpainted. After one day, $\\frac12$ of the floor is left unpainted. After two days, $\\frac1{2^2}$ of the floor is left unpainted, and so on. After $n$ days, $\\frac1{2^n}$ of the floor is unpainted. The floor has area $15^2 = 225$ square feet, so we look for the least number of days $n$ when at most $\\frac1{225}$ of the floor is left unpainted: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac1{2^n} &\\leq \\frac1{225}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2^n &\\geq 225\\\\\n\\Rightarrow n&\\geq8.\n\\end{align*} Thus, Zeno took $\\boxed{8}$ days to paint the floor."
