At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConnie is starting an exercise program. On June 1, she will do 25 sit-ups. Each day after that, she will increase her number of sit-ups by four. On which date during the month of June will Connie first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day?",
