At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSquare A and Square B are both $2009$ by $2009$ squares.  Square A has both its length and width increased by an amount $x$, while Square B has its length and width decreased by the same amount $x$.  What is the minimum value of $x$ such that the difference in area between the two new squares is at least as great as the area of a $2009$ by $2009$ square?",
