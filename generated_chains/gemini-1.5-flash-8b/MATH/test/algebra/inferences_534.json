At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
        "inference": "Let $C$ be the number of correct answers, $I$ be the number of incorrect answers, and $U$ be the number of unanswered questions.\nWe are given that the total number of questions is 100.\nThus, $C + I + U = 100$.\nWe are given that Frank answered 80 questions, so $C + I = 80$.\nFrom $C + I + U = 100$, we have $80 + U = 100$, which implies $U = 20$.\nThe score for correct answers is $5C$, for incorrect answers is $-2I$, and for unanswered questions is $0 \\times U = 0$.\nThe total score is $5C - 2I$.\nWe are given that the total score is 232, so $5C - 2I = 232$.\nWe have the system of equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $C + I = 80$\n    \\item $5C - 2I = 232$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom equation (1), $I = 80 - C$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2), we get\n$5C - 2(80 - C) = 232$\n$5C - 160 + 2C = 232$\n$7C = 232 + 160$\n$7C = 392$\n$C = \\frac{392}{7}$\n$C = 56$\nNow, we find $I$:\n$I = 80 - C = 80 - 56 = 24$\nThus, Frank answered 56 questions correctly.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly."
