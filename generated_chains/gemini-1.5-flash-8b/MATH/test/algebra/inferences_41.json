        "inference": "The problem is asking for the value of $y$ when $a = 4$ in the equation $3x + 2y = 12$. The solution, as presented, appears to assume that $x = a$, which isn't stated in the question.  We need to find a value for $y$.\n\n\n$3x + 2y = 12$\nIf $a = 4$, there is no explicit connection between $a$ and $x$ or $y$. Thus, the problem is ill-posed.  We need more information to solve the problem.  If we're supposed to find $y$ given $a=4$, we need an expression for $x$ in terms of $a$ or $y$ in terms of $a$.\n\nWithout any further information, it is impossible to find a unique value for $y$.\n\n$\\boxed{0}$ is not correct.\n",
