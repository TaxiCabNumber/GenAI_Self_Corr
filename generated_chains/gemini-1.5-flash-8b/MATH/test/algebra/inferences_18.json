At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?",
        "inference": "Let T represent the weight of a trek, S represent the weight of a squig, and G represent the weight of a goolee.\nWe are given the following information:\n1) 10T = 3S + 1G\n2) 2T + 1G = 1S\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express G in terms of T and S:\n1G = 1S - 2T\nSubstitute this expression for G into equation (1):\n10T = 3S + (1S - 2T)\n10T = 4S - 2T\n12T = 4S\nS = 3T\n\nTherefore, the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of 3 treeks.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \\begin{align*}\n10t &=3s+g\\\\\n2t +g &= s.\n\\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \\begin{align*}\n10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow s &=3t.\n\\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\\boxed{3}$ treeks."
