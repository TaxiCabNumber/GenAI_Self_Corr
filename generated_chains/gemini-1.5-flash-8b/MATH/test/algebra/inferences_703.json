        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 7th and 8th grades have enrollments of 520 and 650 respectively. The two grades have a total of 18 representatives on the Student Council. How many representatives should the 8th grade have if there is to be a fair representation of the two grades?",
        "inference": "1. Total students: 520 + 650 = 1170\n2. Ratio of students: 520/1170 = 52/117 \u2248 0.444\n3. Ratio of students: 650/1170 = 65/117 \u2248 0.556\n4.  Ratio of representatives: 0.444 + 0.556 = 1\n5.  Let 'x' be the number of representatives from 8th grade. Then the number of representatives from 7th grade = 18 - x.\n6.  Fair representation means the ratio of representatives matches the ratio of students.\n7.  (18-x) / x = 52/65\n8.  65(18-x) = 52x\n9.  1170 - 65x = 52x\n10. 1170 = 117x\n11. x = 10\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The 8th grade has $\\frac{650}{520+650} = \\frac{650}{1170} = \\frac{65}{117}$ of the total students. To simplify this fraction further, we notice that $65 = 5 \\cdot 13$. Since $117$ is not divisible by $5$, we test if it's divisible by $13$ and find that $117 = 9 \\cdot 13$. Thus to have fair representation, the 8th grade should have $\\frac{65}{117} \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 18 = \\boxed{10}$ of the $18$ representatives."
