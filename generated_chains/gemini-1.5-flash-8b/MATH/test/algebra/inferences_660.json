Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get\n$x/3 > 1/ \\frac{1}{3} \\implies x/3 > 3 \\implies x > 9$.\nNext, consider $\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we get\n$x/3 < 4/3 \\implies x < 4$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we have $9 < x < 4$.  This is impossible since $9 > 4$.  To be greater than 9, $x$ must also be less than 4, which is impossible.\nLet's look at the inequality again $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$.\nWe can rewrite the inequality as\n$\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{x}$ and $\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$.\nFor $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{x}$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides (remembering to reverse the inequality signs):\n$3 < \\frac{9}{x} \\implies 3x < 9 \\implies x < 3$\nFor $\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$, we can take the reciprocal of both sides (remembering to reverse the inequality signs):\n$x < 4$\n\nCombining these inequalities gives $x < 3$ and $x < 4$.\nSince $x$ is an integer, $x$ must be less than 3.\nSo we have $9 < x$ and $x < 4$.\nThe integer values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality are $10, 11, 12, ...$. But the inequality given is $1/3 < 3/x < 3/4$ which means $x/3 > 1/3$ and $3/x < 3/4$, which gives us $x > 3$ and $4 < x$.\nWe now find the integer values of x such that $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$. \nFrom $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{x}$, we have $x < 9$.\nFrom $\\frac{3}{x} < \\frac{3}{4}$, we have $x > 4$.\nCombining the inequalities we get $4 < x < 9$. \nThe integers satisfying this are 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThe sum of these integers is $5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$",
