        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $a$ is parallel to line $b$ and goes through the point $(1,2)$. Line $b$ goes through the point $(3,1)$ and is perpendicular to line $c$ whose equation is $y=-2x+3$. Find the y-intercept of line $a$.",
        "inference": "1. Since line $c$ has the equation $y = -2x + 3$, its slope is $-2$.\n2. Line $b$ is perpendicular to line $c$, so the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $c$. The slope of line $b$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n3. Line $b$ goes through the point $(3,1)$. Using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of line $b$ is $y - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 3)$, which simplifies to $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2} + 1$, or $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n4. Line $a$ is parallel to line $b$, so the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n5. Line $a$ goes through the point $(1,2)$. Using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of line $a$ is $y - 2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x - 1)$, which simplifies to $y = \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2} + 2$, or $y = \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{3}{2}$.\n6. The y-intercept is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. Plugging in $x = 0$ into the equation for line $a$, we get $y = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $b$ is the negative reciprocal of $-2$, which is $\\frac12$. The slopes of parallel lines are the same, therefore the slope of line $a$ is also $\\frac12$. Using the point-slope formula, the equation of line $a$ is $y-2=\\frac12(x-1)$. Changing the form to slope-intercept, we get the equation $y=\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac32$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{\\frac32}$."
