        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNew York and Denver are in different time zones.  When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver.  A train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time) and arrives in Denver 45 hours later.  What time is it in Denver when the train arrives?",
        "inference": "1. The train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time).\n2. The train travels for 45 hours.\n3. To find the New York time of arrival, we add 45 hours to 2 p.m.: 2 p.m. + 45 hours = 2 p.m. + 1 day + 22 hours = 2 p.m. + 1 day + 10 p.m. = 10 p.m. next day. This means it is 10 p.m. on the day after the train left New York.\n\n4. Since the time difference between New York and Denver is 2 hours (New York is 2 hours ahead of Denver), we subtract 2 hours from the New York arrival time: 10 p.m. - 2 hours = 8 p.m.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8:00 PM}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$"
