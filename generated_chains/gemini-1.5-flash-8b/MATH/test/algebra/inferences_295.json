At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA man nearing retirement wants to invest some money in a fund that compounds annually at a rate of 6 percent, so that in five years, he will have at least $\\$100,000$.  How much money must he invest now to make that happen?  (Give your answer to the nearest dollar.)",
