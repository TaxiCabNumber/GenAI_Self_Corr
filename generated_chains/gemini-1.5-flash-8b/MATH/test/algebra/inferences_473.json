        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy usual workout consists of running 10 laps around a 400 meter track. If I go to a track that is only 250 meters long, how many laps will I need to run to get the same workout?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total distance of my usual workout: 10 laps * 400 meters/lap = 4000 meters.\n2. Calculate the number of laps needed on the shorter track: 4000 meters / 250 meters/lap = 16 laps.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the total distance that I run is constant, the length of each lap and the total number of laps are inversely proportional. Consequently, if each lap is $\\frac{250}{400}=\\frac{5}{8}$ as long, I need to run $\\frac{8}{5}$ as many laps, so our answer is $\\frac{8}{5}\\cdot10=\\boxed{16}$ laps."
