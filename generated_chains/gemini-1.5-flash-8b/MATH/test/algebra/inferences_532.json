At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chime clock strikes 1 chime at one o'clock, 2 chimes at two o'clock, 3 chimes at three o'clock, and so forth. What is the total number of chimes the clock will strike in a twelve-hour period?",
        "inference": "The number of chimes struck at each hour is the hour number.\nThe total number of chimes in a twelve-hour period is the sum of the integers from 1 to 12.\nThe sum of the first n integers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2.\nIn this case, n = 12.\nThe sum is 12(12+1)/2 = 12(13)/2 = 156/2 = 78.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We want to find the sum $1 + 2 + \\dots + 12$.  This sum is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the total number of terms, which is \\[\\frac{1 + 12}{2} \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{78}.\\]"
