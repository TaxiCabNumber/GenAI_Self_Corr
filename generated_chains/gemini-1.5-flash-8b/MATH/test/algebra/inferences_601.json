At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $t$ is greater than $2$ and less than $3.5$. How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition?",
        "inference": "1. The square root of $t$ is greater than $2$.  This means $\\sqrt{t} > 2$. Squaring both sides, we get $t > 4$.\n\n2. The square root of $t$ is less than $3.5$. This means $\\sqrt{t} < 3.5$. Squaring both sides, we get $t < 12.25$.\n\n3. Combining the two inequalities, we have $4 < t < 12.25$.\n\n4. The integer values of $t$ that satisfy this condition are $5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$.\n\n5. Counting the integers, we have $11 - 5 + 1 = 7$ integer values.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have: $2 < \\sqrt{t} < \\frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $\\boxed{8}$ possible integer values of $t$."
