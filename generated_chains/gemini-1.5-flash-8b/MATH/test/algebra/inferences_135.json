        "inference": "1. The line $3x-7y = 65$ can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form $y = \\frac{3}{7}x - \\frac{65}{7}$.  The slope of this line is $\\frac{3}{7}$.\n2. Since the line parallel to $3x-7y = 65$ passes through the point $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$, it must have the same slope $\\frac{3}{7}$.\n3. Using the point-slope form of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, we can use the point $(7,4)$ and the slope $\\frac{3}{7}$:\n   $y - 4 = \\frac{3}{7}(x - 7)$.\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   $y - 4 = \\frac{3}{7}x - 3$\n   $y = \\frac{3}{7}x + 1$.\n5. Now, we can use the point $(0,K)$ to find K. Substitute $x=0$ and $y=K$ into the equation:\n   $K = \\frac{3}{7}(0) + 1$\n   $K = 1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We put the equation of the line into slope-intercept form by solving for $y$: $y=\\frac{65-3x}{-7}$. That means the slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{7}$, and the slope of a parallel line must also be $\\frac{3}{7}$. The slope of the line through $(7,4)$ and $(0,K)$ is $\\frac{4-K}{7-0}$, which we set equal to $\\frac{3}{7}$ and solve for $K$. $$\\frac{4-K}{7}=\\frac{3}{7}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 4-K=3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow 1=K$$ So the value of K is $\\boxed{1}$."
