At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $h(x)=f^{-1}(x)$. If $h(2)=10$, $h(10)=1$ and $h(1)=2$, what is $f(f(10))$?",

Since $f(10) = 2$, we have $f(f(10)) = f(2)$.\nFrom the given information, $f(2) = 1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
