        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of teachers to students in a particular school is 1 to 11. The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. If there are 396 female students, how many teachers are there?",
        "inference": "1. If the ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9, and there are 396 female students, then the total number of students is (9/4) * 396 = 9 * 99 = 891.\n\n2. The ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11.  This means there are 1 teacher for every 11 students.\n\n3. The number of teachers is (1/11) * 891 = 81.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total."
