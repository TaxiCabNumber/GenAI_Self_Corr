At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?",
        "inference": "To find the vertical asymptotes of the function $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator is zero and the numerator is not zero.\nThe denominator is $x^2+x-6$. We need to find the values of $x$ for which $x^2+x-6=0$. Factoring the quadratic gives $(x+3)(x-2)=0$.\nThis means the denominator is zero when $x=-3$ or $x=2$.\nThe numerator is always 2, which is not zero.\nTherefore, there are vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.\nHow many vertical asymptotes are there? There are 2 vertical asymptotes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes."
