At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the arithmetic sequence be denoted by $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \\dots$.\nThe first term is $a_1$. The common difference is $d$.\nGiven $a_1 = a_3 - a_2$.\nSince the terms form an arithmetic sequence, we have $a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$, $a_4 = a_1 + 3d$.\nSubstituting these into the given equation, we have $a_1 = (a_1 + 2d) - (a_1 + d)$.\nSimplifying, $a_1 = a_1 + 2d - a_1 - d = a_1 + d$.\nThis gives $a_1 = a_1 + d$, so $d=0$. This means the sequence is constant.\nGiven that $a_4 = 8$, we have $a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 8$.\nSince $d=0$, we have $a_1 + 3(0) = 8$.\nTherefore, $a_1 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  We told that the first term is equal to the third term minus the second term, so the first term is equal to $d$.  Then the second term is equal to $2d$, the third term is equal to $3d$, and the fourth term is equal to $4d = 8$.  Hence, the first term is $d = \\boxed{2}$."
