        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?",
        "inference": "The height of the ball is given by the quadratic function $h(t) = -25t^2 + 75t + 24$.  This is a parabola opening downward, so the maximum height occurs at the vertex.  The t-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $at^2 + bt + c$ is given by $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$.\n\nIn this case, $a = -25$ and $b = 75$.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$t = -\\frac{75}{2(-25)} = -\\frac{75}{-50} = \\frac{75}{50} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the maximum height of the ball by maximizing the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-25$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-25t^2+75t+24=-25(t^2-3t)+24\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $\\left( -\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{9}{4}$ inside the parentheses to get \\begin{align*}\n-25(t^2-3t)+24&=-25\\left(t^2-3t+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{225}{4}+\\frac{96}{4}\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{321}{4}\n\\end{align*}Since $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=0$. This happens when $t-\\frac{3}{2}=0$. Therefore the height of the ball is at its maximum when $t=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$."
