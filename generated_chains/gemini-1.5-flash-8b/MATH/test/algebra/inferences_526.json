        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have a square that has a side length of $1$ centimeter. Each minute, $2$ centimeters are added to the side length. After $10$ minutes, what will be the difference between the area of the last square and the area of the initial square in square centimeters (do not include the units in your answer)?",
        "inference": "1. Initial square side length = 1 cm.\n2. Initial square area = 1 cm * 1 cm = 1 square cm.\n3. After 1 minute, side length = 1 cm + 2 cm = 3 cm.\n4. Area after 1 minute = 3 cm * 3 cm = 9 square cm.\n5. After 2 minutes, side length = 1 cm + (2 cm * 2) = 5 cm.\n6. Area after 2 minutes = 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 square cm.\n7. After 10 minutes, side length = 1 cm + (2 cm * 10) = 1 cm + 20 cm = 21 cm.\n8. Area after 10 minutes = 21 cm * 21 cm = 441 square cm.\n9. Difference in area = 441 square cm - 1 square cm = 440 square cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{440}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The initial square has area $1^2 = 1\\text{ cm}^2$. After ten minutes, the side length of the square will be $1 + 2\\cdot 10 = 21\\text{ cm}$. So, the last square has area $21^2 = 441\\text{ cm}^2$. So the difference in areas is $441 - 1 = \\boxed{440\\text{ cm}^2}$."
