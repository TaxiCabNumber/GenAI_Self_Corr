At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile on her vacation in Cancun, Colleen can buy a sombrero and a pair of flip-flops for $\\$32$. She can buy the pair of flip-flops and sunglasses for $\\$42$. She can buy the sombrero and the sunglasses for $\\$30$. How many dollars does the sombrero cost?",

Substituting G = 10 + S, we have S + (10 + S) = 30.\nThis simplifies to 2S + 10 = 30, which gives 2S = 20, and thus S = 10.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$",
