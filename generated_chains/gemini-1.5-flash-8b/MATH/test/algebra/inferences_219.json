At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the numbers 4, 5 and 6 are each used exactly once to replace the letters in the expression $A ( B - C )$, what is the least possible result?",

We want $B - C$ to be as small as possible.\n$B - C$ can be $4 - 6 = -2$, $5 - 6 = -1$, or $6 - 5 = 1$.\nThe smallest value is $-2$.\nThen we want $A$ to be as small as possible.  This means $A = 4$.\nThus, the expression becomes $4(4 - 6) = 4(-2) = -8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-8}$ I hope it is correct.",
