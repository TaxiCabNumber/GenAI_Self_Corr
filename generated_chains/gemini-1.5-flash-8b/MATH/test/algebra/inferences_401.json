        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers are in the solution of the inequality $|x + 4|< 9$?",
        "inference": "1. The inequality is $|x + 4| < 9$.\n2. This inequality is equivalent to $-9 < x + 4 < 9$.\n3. Subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality: $-9 - 4 < x + 4 - 4 < 9 - 4$.\n4. Simplify: $-13 < x < 5$.\n5. The integers that satisfy this inequality are -12, -11, ..., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n6. To count the integers, we find the number of integers from -12 to 4, inclusive. This is $4 - (-12) + 1 = 4 + 12 + 1 = 17$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $x+4\\geq 0$ (or $x\\geq -4$), then the given inequality is the same as $x+4<9$ which means $x<5$. If $x+4<0$ (or $x<-4$), we have $-(x+4)<9$ which means $x+4>-9$ which yields $x>-13$. Thus, the solution is $-13<x<5$. Thus, the integers in this solution are -1 through -12 (12 integers), 1 through 4 (4 integers), and 0 (1 integer). Thus, the total is $12+4+1=\\boxed{17}$ integers."
