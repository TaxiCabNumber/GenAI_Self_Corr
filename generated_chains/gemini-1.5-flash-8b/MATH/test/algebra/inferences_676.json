At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWilliam runs at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour. Running at this constant speed, it takes William 75 seconds to run from his house to school. How many miles did William run?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 75 seconds to hours: 75 seconds * (1 minute / 60 seconds) * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 0.0208333 hours.\n\n2. Calculate the distance: Speed = Distance / Time, so Distance = Speed * Time.  Distance = 8 miles/hour * 0.0208333 hours = 0.1666664 miles.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.17}$ miles. I hope it is correct.\n",
