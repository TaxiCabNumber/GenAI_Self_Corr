At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "1 five-pound cake requires 1.5 cups * (5 pounds / 2 pounds) = 3.75 cups of flour.\n2 five-pound cakes require 3.75 cups * 2 = 7.5 cups of flour.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7.5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

Since a two-pound cake requires $1.5$ cups of flour, a ten pounds of cake will require five times as much flour (since $10/2=5$). Five times $1.5$ cups of flour is $\\boxed{7.5}$ pounds of flour."
