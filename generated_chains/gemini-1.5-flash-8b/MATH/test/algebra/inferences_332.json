        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 12 and their product is 35. What is the positive difference between the numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be x and y.\nWe are given that x + y = 12 and xy = 35.\nWe want to find the positive difference between the numbers, which is |x - y|.\nWe know that (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) - 4xy = (x + y)^2 - 4xy.\nSubstituting the given values, we have (x - y)^2 = (12)^2 - 4(35) = 144 - 140 = 4.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get |x - y| = \u221a4 = 2.\nThe positive difference between the numbers is 2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.  We are given  \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12\\text{, and} \\\\\nxy&=35.\n\\end{align*} Solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second equation, we find $x(12-x)=35$.  Subtracting the left-hand side from both sides of the equation and distributing, we find $0=x^2-12x+35$.  We can factor the right-hand side as $(x-7)(x-5)$, so the solutions are $x=7$ and $x=5$.  Substituting either of these back into $y=12-x$, we find that the two numbers are $7$ and $5$, and their difference is $\\boxed{2}$."
