At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 60 feet per second from a height of 54 feet from the ground, where $t$ represents time, measured in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "1. The ball hits the ground when the height is 0.  So we set $y = 0$:\n   $0 = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$\n\n2. This is a quadratic equation in the form $at^2 + bt + c = 0$, where $a = -16$, $b = -60$, and $c = 54$.\n\n3. We use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$:\n   $t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n   $t = \\frac{-(-60) \\pm \\sqrt{(-60)^2 - 4(-16)(54)}}{2(-16)}$\n   $t = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{3600 + 3456}}{-32}$\n   $t = \\frac{60 \\pm \\sqrt{7056}}{-32}$\n   $t = \\frac{60 \\pm 84}{-32}$\n\n4. We have two possible solutions:\n   $t_1 = \\frac{60 + 84}{-32} = \\frac{144}{-32} = -4.5$\n   $t_2 = \\frac{60 - 84}{-32} = \\frac{-24}{-32} = 0.75$\n\n5.
