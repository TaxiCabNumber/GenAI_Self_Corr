At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve friends met for dinner at Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House, and each ordered one meal. The portions were so large, there was enough food for 18 people. If they share, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?",
        "inference": "12 friends need food for 12 people, but there is food for 18.\nThe ratio of people to meals is 12 friends / 12 meals = 1.\nThe ratio of people to meals is 18 people / x meals = 1.8 (where x is the number of meals).\nSince the food is sufficient for 18 people, 12 people will need less than 12 meals (18 people / 12 people = 1.5).\nThe amount of food is enough for 18 people, which means the ratio of people to meals is 18/x = 1.2.\nIf they share, the food for 18 people is enough to feed 12 people.\nThis means 18 portions are sufficient for 12 people.\n18 portions / 12 people = 1.5 portions per person.\nIf 12 people want to eat, then they need 12 meals.\nIf 18 people can eat with the food, and 12 people need the same amount of food, they need 12/18 * number of meals.\n12/18 = 2/3.\nThus, 2/3 of 12 meals = 12 * 2/3 = 8 meals.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If 12 people order $\\frac{18}{12}=1\\frac{1}{2}$ times too much food, they should have ordered $\\frac{12}{\\frac{3}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3}\\times 12=\\boxed{8}$ meals."
