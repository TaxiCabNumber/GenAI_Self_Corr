At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile watching a parade I saw some clowns and horses. I counted 30 legs and 10 heads. How many horses did I see in the parade?",
        "inference": "Let 'c' be the number of clowns and 'h' be the number of horses.\nClowns have 2 legs and 1 head. Horses have 4 legs and 1 head.\nWe have the following system of equations:\n1) c + h = 10\n2) 2c + 4h = 30\n\nFrom equation 1), we can express c in terms of h:\nc = 10 - h\n\nSubstitute this into equation 2):\n2(10 - h) + 4h = 30\n20 - 2h + 4h = 30\n20 + 2h = 30\n2h = 10\nh = 5\n\nNow substitute h = 5 back into equation 1):\nc + 5 = 10\nc = 5\n\nTherefore, there are 5 horses.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of clowns in the parade be $c$ and the number of horses be $h$. We are looking for the value of $h$. Assuming that each clown has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each horse has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2c+4h &= 30 \\\\\nc + h &= 10 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo solve for $h$, we need to eliminate $c$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $c=10-h$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $c$ gives $2(10-h)+4h = 30$, or $h=5$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ horses in the parade."
