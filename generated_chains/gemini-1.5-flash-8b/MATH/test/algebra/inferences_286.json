At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job?",
        "inference": "Let $N$ be the charge for coming out to the house, and $x$ be the charge per hour.\nFor a one-hour repair job, the charge is $N + 1x = 97$.\nFor a five-hour repair job, the charge is $N + 5x = 265$.\nWe have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1) $N + x = 97$\n2) $N + 5x = 265$\nWe can solve for $N$ and $x$.\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$(N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97$\n$4x = 168$\n$x = \\frac{168}{4} = 42$\nNow substitute the value of $x$ into equation (1):\n$N + 42 = 97$\n$N = 97 - 42 = 55$\nSo, the charge for coming out to the house is $N = 55$ dollars, and the charge per hour is $x = 42$ dollars.\nFor a two-hour repair job, the charge is $N + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{139}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nN+x &= 97\\\\\nN+5x &= 265\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \\begin{align*}\n4x &= 265-97=168\\\\\nx &= 42.\n\\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \\$ 55+2\\cdot \\$ 42 = \\boxed{\\$ 139}$."
