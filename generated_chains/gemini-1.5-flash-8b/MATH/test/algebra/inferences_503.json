        "inference": "The problem is asking for the domain of a function involving a square root.  The function is not given, but the argument under the square root is $x^2 - 5x + 6$.  For the square root to be defined, the expression inside must be non-negative.\n\nThe expression $x^2 - 5x + 6$ is equal to zero when $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.  Also, the expression is positive for $x < 2$ or $x > 3$ and non-negative for $x=2$ and $x=3$. Thus, we have $x^2 - 5x + 6 \\ge 0$ for $x \\le 2$ or $x \\ge 3$.  The denominator $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3)$ cannot be zero, so $x \\ne 2$ and $x \\ne 3$.\n\nCombining these conditions, we have $x \\le 2$ or $x \\ge 3$.\nThe final answer is $(-\\infty, 2] \\cup [3,\\infty)$.\n\n$\\boxed{(-\\infty, 2] \\cup [3, \\infty)}$\n",
