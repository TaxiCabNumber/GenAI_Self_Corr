        "ground_truth": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$."

        "inference": "The problem statement is missing crucial information about the equations.  We need the first equation to analyze the system. Assuming the first equation is of the form $Ax + Cy = D$, we can proceed with the given substitution.\n\nLet the first equation be $Ax+Cy=D$. The second equation is $y = -3-5x$.  Substituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$Ax + C(-3-5x) = D$$\n$$Ax - 3C - 5Cx = D$$\n$$(A-5C)x - 3C = D$$\nFor infinitely many solutions, the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term must both be zero.\n$$A-5C = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -3C = D$$\nWe need to know the values of $A$ and $C$ to find $a$ and $b$.
