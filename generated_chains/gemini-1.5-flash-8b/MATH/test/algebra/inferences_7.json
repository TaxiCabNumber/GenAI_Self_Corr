At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate.  After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars.  What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage?  (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)",
        "inference": "Let $P$ be the initial investment, $r$ be the annual interest rate, $t$ be the number of years, and $A$ be the amount after $t$ years.\nThe formula for compound interest is $A = P(1+r)^t$.\nIn this case, $P = 1000$, $A = 1225$, and $t = 3$.\nWe have $1225 = 1000(1+r)^3$.\nDividing both sides by 1000, we get\n$(1+r)^3 = \\frac{1225}{1000} = 1.225$.\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get\n$1+r = \\sqrt[3]{1.225} \\approx 1.06295$.\nSubtracting 1 from both sides, we get\n$r = 1.06295 - 1 = 0.06295$.\nTo express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n$r \\approx 0.06295 \\times 100 = 6.295\\%$.\nRounding to the nearest integer, we get $6\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
