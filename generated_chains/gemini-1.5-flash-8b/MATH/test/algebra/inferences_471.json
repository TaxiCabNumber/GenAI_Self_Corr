At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, and four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, how many cupcakes can Bob buy for the price of eighteen cookies?",
        "inference": "1. Six cookies = 2 brownies.  This means 1 brownie = 3 cookies.\n\n2. Four brownies = 10 cupcakes.  Substituting the equivalent of brownies in cookies: 4 * 3 cookies = 10 cupcakes, which means 12 cookies = 10 cupcakes.\n\n3.  Therefore, 1 cupcake = 1.2 cookies (12 cookies / 10 cupcakes).\n\n4. Bob has the price of 18 cookies.  Dividing 18 cookies by the cost of 1 cupcake in cookies: 18 cookies / 1.2 cookies/cupcake = 15 cupcakes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes."

        "inference": "Let $C$ be the cost of a cookie, $B$ the cost of a brownie, and $P$ the cost of a cupcake.\nFrom the first statement, 6 cookies = 2 brownies.  This means 3 cookies = 1 brownie.  So $3C = B$.\nFrom the second statement, 4 brownies = 10 cupcakes. Substituting $B = 3C$, we have $4(3C) = 10P$, which simplifies to $12C = 10P$.\nTherefore, $1.2C = P$, which means 1 cupcake costs 1.2 cookies.\nBob has the price of 18 cookies.
