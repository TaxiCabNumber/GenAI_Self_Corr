At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou connect the points (0, 0) and (9, 6) with a line segment. Starting at (0, 0), you move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment. What is the sum of the coordinates of the point you land upon?",

Moving $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment from $A$ to $B$ means we are looking for the point that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the vector $\\langle 9, 6 \\rangle$.  To find this point, we multiply the vector by $\\frac{1}{3}$:  $\\frac{1}{3}\\langle 9, 6 \\rangle = \\langle 3, 2 \\rangle$.\n\nAdding this vector to the starting point (0,0) gives the new point: $(0+3, 0+2) = (3, 2)$.\n\nThe sum of the coordinates is $3+2=5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since we move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way along the segment, we will move $\\frac{1}{3}(9-0) = 3$ units in the $x$-direction and $\\frac{1}{3}(6-0)= 2$ units in the $y$-direction. This means that we will end up at the point $(0 + 3, 0 + 2) = (3, 2)$. Adding the sum of the coordinates of this point, we find that the answer is $3 + 2 = \\boxed{5}$."
