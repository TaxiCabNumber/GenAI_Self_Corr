        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all possible values of $x$ such that $2x(x-10)=-50$?",
        "inference": "1. Distribute the $2x$: $2x^2 - 20x = -50$\n2. Move the constant to the left side: $2x^2 - 20x + 50 = 0$\n3. Divide by 2: $x^2 - 10x + 25 = 0$\n4. Factor the quadratic: $(x-5)(x-5) = 0$\n5. Solve for $x$: $x = 5$\n6. The possible values of $x$ are $x=5$.\n7. The sum of the possible values of $x$ is $5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First we divide both sides by 2 to get $x(x-10)=-25$. Expanding the left side and bringing the constant over, we get $x^2-10x+25=0$. We can factor this into $(x-5)(x-5)$, so the only possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is also our answer."
