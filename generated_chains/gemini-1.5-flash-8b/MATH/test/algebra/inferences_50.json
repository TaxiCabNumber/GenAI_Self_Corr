We can find the equations for the different segments:\n   - From $x=0$ to $x=6$, the slope is $\\frac{8-2}{6-0} = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$. The y-intercept is 2. So, $f(x) = x+2$ for $0\\le x\\le 6$.\n   - From $x=6$ to $x=10$, the slope is $\\frac{8-8}{10-6} = 0$, and the function value is 8, so $f(x)=8$ for $6 \\le x \\le 10$.\n   - From $x=10$ to $x=12$, the slope is $\\frac{10-8}{12-10} = 1$, and the function value at $x=10$ is $f(10)=8$, so the equation is $f(x) = x -2$ for $10\\le x\\le 12$.\n   - From $x=12$ to $x=18$, the slope is $\\frac{10-10}{18-12} = 0$. The y-value is 10, so $f(x)=10$ for $12\\le x\\le 18$.\n2. Analyze the graph of $g(x)$. The function is also piecewise linear.\n   - From $x=0$ to $x=2$, the slope is $\\frac{10-10}{2-0} = 0$. The function value is 10, so $g(x) = 10$ for $0 \\le x \\le 2$.\n   - From $x=2$ to $x=8$, the slope is $\\frac{10-10}{8-2} = 0$. The function value is 10. So, $g(x)=10$ for $2\\le x \\le 8$.\n   - From $x=8$ to $x=10$, the slope is $\\frac{4-10}{10-8} = \\frac{-6}{2} = -3$. The function value at $x=8$ is 4. So, $g(x) = -3x+22$ for $8\\le x\\le 10$.\n   - From $x=10$ to $x=18$, the slope is $\\frac{12-4}{18-10} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1$. The function value at $x=10$ is 4. So, $g(x) = x-6$ for $10\\le x\\le 18$.\n\n3. Find the difference $f(x)-g(x)$:\n   - For $x=10$, $f(10)-g(10) = 4-4=0$.\n   - For $x=12$, $f(12)-g(12) = 10-10=0$.\n   - For $x=2$, $f(2)-g(2) = 10-10=0$.\n   - For $x=6$, $f(6)-g(6) = 8-8=0$.\n\nNow we have to check values for $f(x)-g(x)$. Looking at the difference function, it seems that the maximal difference will occur near $x=18$.  When $x=18$, $f(18) = 12$ and $g(18) = 10$, so $f(18)-g(18)=12-10=2$.\n4. Find the maximum difference for other values.  $f(x)-g(x)$ seems to reach a maximum around x=8 to 10. For $x=8$, $f(8)=4$ and $g(8)=4$, so $f(8)-g(8) = 0$.\n\nBy examining the graphs, we see the largest difference occurs around x=18. Thus, the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ is 2.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$",
        "ground_truth": "We can measure $|f(x)-g(x)|$ as the vertical distance between the two graphs at $x$. The sign of $f(x)-g(x)$ is positive if $f(x)>g(x)$, so we focus on the part of the graph where the dashed orange line lies above the solid dark green line. Within this part of the graph, the greatest vertical distance between the orange and green lines is $\\boxed{4}$ (achieved for all $x$ from $8$ to $12$)."
