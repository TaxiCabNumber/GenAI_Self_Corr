At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJosh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?",

        "ground_truth": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$."
