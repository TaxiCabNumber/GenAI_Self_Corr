        "inference": "The parabola is $y=x^2-8x+5$.  Completing the square gives $y = (x-4)^2-16+5 = (x-4)^2-11$.  The vertex is at $(4,-11)$.\nSince the opposite side is parallel to the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the other two vertices is the same.

        "ground_truth": "One vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{-(-8)}{2(1)}=4$. To find the $y$-coordinate, we plug in $x=4$ to find $y=4^2-8\\cdot 4+5=16-32+5=-11$. So one vertex of the triangle is at $(4, -11)$.\n\nThe other two vertices are on the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2-8x+5$ and the line $y=k$. Thus we have $x^2-8x+5=k$ or $x^2-8x+(5-k)=0$.

This means the height is equal to $k-(-11)=k+11$, since $-11$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.
