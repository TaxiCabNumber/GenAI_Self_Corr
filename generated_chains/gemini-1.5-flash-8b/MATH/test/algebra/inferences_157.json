        "inference": "Let $f(x) = x^2 + 2$.\nLet $g(x) = x^2$.\nWe have $f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = (x^2)^2 + 2 = x^4 + 2$.\nWe have $g(f(x)) = g(x^2 + 2) = (x^2 + 2)^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$.\nGiven $f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = x^2 + 2$, we have $x^4 + 2 = x^2 + 2$. This simplifies to $x^4 = x^2$, which gives $x^4 - x^2 = 0$ or $x^2(x^2 - 1) = 0$. This implies $x^2 = 0$ or $x^2 = 1$. Thus, $x = 0$ or $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.\nAlso, given $g(f(x)) = g(x^2 + 2) = (x^2 + 2)^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 + 4$.\nComparing the expressions, we have $x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = (x^2+2)^2 = x^2+2$.\n$x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = x^2 + 2$. This simplifies to $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2 = 0$.\nLet $u = x^2$. Then $u^2 + 3u + 2 = 0$. This factors as $(u + 1)(u + 2) = 0$.\nThis gives $u = -1$ or $u = -2$.\nSince $u = x^2$, we have $x^2 = -1$ or $x^2 = -2$. Since $x^2$ cannot be negative, there are no real solutions.\nThe problem statement likely has a typo or is inconsistent.\nIf the given information is $f(g(x)) = f(x^2) = x^2 + 2$, $g(f(x)) = g(x+2) = (x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4$, the given $x^2+2 = x^2+4x+4$ implies $4x+2 = 0$ or $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nChecking $x=-\\frac{1}{2}$, $f(g(-\\frac{1}{2})) = f(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{4} + 2 = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n$g(f(-\\frac{1}{2})) = g(-\\frac{1}{2} + 2) = g(\\frac{3}{2}) = (\\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$.\n\nThus $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$ is the solution.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1/2}$",
