At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdina and Lynn are going rock-climbing and need to rent special shoes. Lynn is normally size 9 and knows that her rock-climbing shoe-size is 42. If Adina is normally size 6, what size rock-climbing shoes should she rent assuming shoe size is directly proportional to rock-climbing shoe size?",
        "inference": "Lynn's normal shoe size is 9 and her rock-climbing shoe size is 42.  The ratio of rock-climbing size to normal size is 42/9 = 14/3.\n\nAdina's normal shoe size is 6.  Her rock-climbing shoe size will be 6 * (14/3) = 84/3 = 28.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be Adina's rock-climbing size.  The ratio of the girl's shoe sizes must be constant: \\[\\frac{\\text{Lynn's size}}{\\text{Adina's size}} = \\frac{9}{6}=\\frac{42}{x},\\]so $9x=42\\cdot 6$, or $x=\\frac{42\\cdot 6}{9}=\\boxed{28}$."
