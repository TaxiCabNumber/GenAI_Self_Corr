        "inference": "The equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is given by $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.\nIn this case, the center is $(-5,2)$, so the equation is $(x-(-5))^2 + (y-2)^2 = r^2$, which simplifies to $(x+5)^2 + (y-2)^2 = r^2$.\nExpanding this equation, we get\n$x^2 + 10x + 25 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = r^2$.\nRearranging the terms, we have\n$x^2 + y^2 + 10x - 4y + 29 = r^2$.\nComparing this to the given equation $Ax^2 + 2y^2 + Bx + Cy = 40$, we have\n$A=1$, $B=10$, $C=-4$.\n$r^2 = 29 + 40 - 29 = 40$.\nThus, $r^2 = 40$, so $r = \\sqrt{40} = 2\\sqrt{10}$.\nThen, $A+B+C+r = 1 + 10 + (-4) + 2\\sqrt{10} = 7 + 2\\sqrt{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7+2\\sqrt{10}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "As the center of the circle is at the point $(-5,2)$ and its radius is $r$, the equation for the circle is $(x+5)^2+(y-2)^2=r^2$. Expanding this, \\begin{align*}\nx^2+10x+25+y^2-4y+4 &= r^2 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2+10x-4y &= r^2-29.\n\\end{align*}Now, this equation must match the form $Ax^2 + 2y^2 + Bx + Cy = 40,$ so we see that we can multiply the above by two so that the coefficients for $y^2$ match: $$2x^2 + 2y^2+20x-8y= 2r^2-58.$$Thus, $A=2$, $B=20$, and $C=-8$. Also, $2r^2-58=40 \\Rightarrow 2r^2=98 \\Rightarrow r^2=49$. As $r$ is the radius, it must be positive, so $r=7$.\nTherefore, $A+B+C+r= 2+20-8+7= \\boxed{21}$."
