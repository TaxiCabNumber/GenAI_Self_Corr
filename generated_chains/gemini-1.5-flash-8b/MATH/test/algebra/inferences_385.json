        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA TV screen measures 24 by 16 inches. If each dimension is increased by 20$\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
        "inference": "Original dimensions: 24 inches by 16 inches.\nOriginal area: 24 * 16 = 384 square inches.\nIncreased dimensions: 24 * 1.2 = 28.8 inches and 16 * 1.2 = 19.2 inches.\nIncreased area: 28.8 * 19.2 = 552.96 square inches.\nIncrease in area: 552.96 - 384 = 168.96 square inches.\nPercent increase: (168.96 / 384) * 100% = 44%.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{44%}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since we're dealing with percentages, the actual dimensions do not matter. Let $l$ and $w$ represent the dimensions of the TV screen. The current area is $lw$. If we increase $l$ by $20\\%$, we end up with $l\\left(1+\\frac{20}{100}\\right)=l\\left(\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{2}{10}\\right)=\\frac{12}{10}l$. Increasing the width results in $\\frac{12}{10}w$. The new area is $\\frac{12}{10}l\\times\\frac{12}{10}w=\\frac{144}{100}lw=lw\\left(1+\\frac{44}{100}\\right)$. The area increases by $\\boxed{44\\%}$."
