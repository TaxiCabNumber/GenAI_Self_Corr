At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?",
