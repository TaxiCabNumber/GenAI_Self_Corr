        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
        "inference": "Let 'd' be the number of dimes and 'n' be the number of nickels.\nWe are given:\nd + n = 11  (Equation 1)\n10d + 5n = 75  (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express d in terms of n:\nd = 11 - n\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 2:\n10(11 - n) + 5n = 75\n110 - 10n + 5n = 75\n110 - 5n = 75\n-5n = 75 - 110\n-5n = -35\nn = 7\n\nSo Hillary has 7 nickels.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels."
