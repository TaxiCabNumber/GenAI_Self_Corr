        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the average of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ if the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7 and the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8?",
        "inference": "1. The average of $a$ and $2b$ is 7.  This means $\\frac{a + 2b}{2} = 7$, which simplifies to $a + 2b = 14$.\n\n2. The average of $a$ and $2c$ is 8. This means $\\frac{a + 2c}{2} = 8$, which simplifies to $a + 2c = 16$.\n\n3. Now we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n   * $a + 2b = 14$\n   * $a + 2c = 16$\n\n4. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'a':\n   $(a + 2c) - (a + 2b) = 16 - 14$\n   $2c - 2b = 2$\n\n5. Divide both sides by 2:\n   $c - b = 1$\n\n6.  We want the average of $a$, $b$, and $c$. This is $\\frac{a + b + c}{3}$.\n\n7.  We can rewrite the first equation as $a = 14 - 2b$.\n8.   We can rewrite the second equation as $a = 16 - 2c$.\n9.   We can set the two expressions for $a$ equal to each other:\n    $14 - 2b = 16 - 2c$\n    $-2b + 2c = 2$\n    $2c - 2b = 2$\n    $c - b = 1$\n10.  From the equation $c - b = 1$, we can solve for $c$: $c = b + 1$.\n11.  Substituting $c = b + 1$ into the second average equation:\n     $a + 2(b+1) = 16$\n     $a + 2b + 2 = 16$\n     $a + 2b = 14$\n\n12. Now we can express $a$ and $c$ in terms of $b$:\n    $a = 14 - 2b$\n    $c = b + 1$\n\n13. We don't need a specific value for $a$, $b$, or $c$. We just need their sum:\n   $a + b + c = (14 - 2b) + b + (b + 1) = 14 - 2b + b + b + 1 = 15$.\n14. Now find the average:\n    $\\frac{a + b + c}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} = 5$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$",
        "ground_truth": "We can rephrase the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2} &= 7\\\\\n\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 8\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a+2b}{2}+\\frac{a+2c}{2} &= 7+8\\\\\n\\frac{2a+2b+2c}{2} &= 15\\\\\na+b+c &= 15\\\\\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3} &= \\frac{15}{3} = \\boxed{5}\n\\end{align*}"
