At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have two arithmetic sequences. The first term of the first sequence is $0$. The second term of the first sequence is the first term of the first sequence plus the first term of the second sequence. Similarly, the third term of the first sequence is the second term of the first sequence plus the second term of the second sequence. If the fifth term of the second sequence is $3$, what is the fifth term of the first sequence?",
        "inference": "Let the first arithmetic sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots$ and the second arithmetic sequence be $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\dots$.\nWe are given that $a_1 = 0$.\nThe second term of the first sequence is $a_2 = a_1 + b_1$. Since $a_1 = 0$, $a_2 = b_1$.\nThe third term of the first sequence is $a_3 = a_2 + b_2 = b_1 + b_2$.\nThe fourth term of the first sequence is $a_4 = a_3 + b_3 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3$.\nThe fifth term of the first sequence is $a_5 = a_4 + b_4 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4$.\nWe are given that $b_5 = 3$.\nSince the second sequence is an arithmetic sequence, we can write $b_n = b_1 + (n-1)d$ for some common difference $d$.\nThen $b_5 = b_1 + 4d = 3$.\nNow, we need to find an expression for $a_5$.\n$a_5 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = (b_1 + 0d) + (b_1 + 1d) + (b_1 + 2d) + (b_1 + 3d) = 4b_1 + 6d$.\nWe have $b_1 + 4d = 3$, so $b_1 = 3 - 4d$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $a_5$,\n$a_5 = 4(3 - 4d) + 6d = 12 - 16d + 6d = 12 - 10d$.\nWe need to find the relationship between $b_1$ and $b_5$ to determine the value of $d$.\n$b_5 = b_1 + 4d = 3$\nIf we consider $b_1 = 1$, $b_5 = 1 + 4d = 3$, so $4d = 2$, $d = 1/2$.\n$a_5 = 12 - 10(1/2) = 12 - 5 = 7$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$",
