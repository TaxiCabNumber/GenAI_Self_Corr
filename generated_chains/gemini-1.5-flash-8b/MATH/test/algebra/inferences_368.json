        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 153, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.7. What is the value of $y - x$?",
        "inference": "1. From the given information, we have:\n   $x + y = 153$\n   $\\frac{x}{y} = 0.7 = \\frac{7}{10}$\n2. From the second equation, we can write $x = \\frac{7}{10} y$.\n3. Substitute this expression for $x$ into the first equation:\n   $\\frac{7}{10} y + y = 153$\n4. Combine the terms with $y$:\n   $\\frac{17}{10} y = 153$\n5. Solve for $y$:\n   $y = 153 \\times \\frac{10}{17} = 9 \\times 10 = 90$\n6. Now substitute the value of $y$ back into the equation $x = \\frac{7}{10}y$:\n   $x = \\frac{7}{10} \\times 90 = 7 \\times 9 = 63$\n7. Finally, calculate $y - x$:\n   $y - x = 90 - 63 = 27$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$."
