        "inference": "1. From the first statement, we have $2d = 17e - 8$.\n2. From the second statement, we have $2e = d - 9$.\n3. We can rewrite the second equation as $d = 2e + 9$.\n4. Substitute the expression for $d$ from step 3 into the first equation:\n   $2(2e + 9) = 17e - 8$\n5. Distribute the 2:\n   $4e + 18 = 17e - 8$\n6. Subtract $4e$ from both sides:\n   $18 = 13e - 8$\n7. Add 8 to both sides:\n   $26 = 13e$\n8. Divide both sides by 13:\n   $e = 2$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
