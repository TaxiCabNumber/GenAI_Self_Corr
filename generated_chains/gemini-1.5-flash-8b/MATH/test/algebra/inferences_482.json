At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJanaina is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2+18x-9 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $c$?",
        "inference": "To complete the square for the equation $x^2 + 18x - 9 = 0$, we first move the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n$$x^2 + 18x = 9$$\nNext, we take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term (which is 18), square it, and add it to both sides of the equation. Half of 18 is 9, and 9 squared is 81. So we add 81 to both sides:\n$$x^2 + 18x + 81 = 9 + 81$$\n$$(x + 9)^2 = 90$$\nComparing this to the form $(x + b)^2 = c$, we have $b = 9$ and $c = 90$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$\n",
