At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA population of bacteria is doubling every four hours. At noon there are $600$ bacteria. If this rate continues, how many bacteria will be present at midnight, twelve hours later?",
        "inference": "1.  The bacteria doubles every 4 hours.\n2.  From noon to midnight is 12 hours.\n3.  12 hours / 4 hours/doubling = 3 doublings.\n4.  The population will double 3 times.\n5.  Initial population: 600 bacteria\n6.  After 1 doubling: 600 * 2 = 1200\n7.  After 2 doublings: 1200 * 2 = 2400\n8.  After 3 doublings: 2400 * 2 = 4800\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4800}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Twelve hours later is three four-hour intervals later, so the population will double three times. The population size will be $600\\times2\\times2\\times2=600\\times2^3=\\boxed{4800}$ bacteria."
