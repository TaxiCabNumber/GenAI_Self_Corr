        "inference": "The question is likely asking for the smallest integer value of x for which the expression $\\sqrt{x^2+x-6}$ is defined.\n\n1. The expression is defined when the denominator is not zero. This is irrelevant as there is no denominator in the expression $\\sqrt{x^2+x-6}$. The denominator issue is a red herring.\n\n2.
