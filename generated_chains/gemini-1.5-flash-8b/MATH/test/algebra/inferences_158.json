At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ inches and the width be $w$ inches.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by $P = 2(l+w)$.\nGiven that the perimeter is 12 inches, we have $2(l+w) = 12$, which simplifies to $l+w = 6$.\nThe area of the rectangle is given by $A = lw$.\nWe want to maximize the area $A$. From $l+w = 6$, we can express $w$ as $w = 6-l$.\nSubstituting this into the area equation, we get $A = l(6-l) = 6l - l^2$.\nTo find the maximum area, we can find the vertex of the parabola $A(l) = -l^2 + 6l$.\nThe $l$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $l = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a = -1$ and $b = 6$.\nSo, $l = -\\frac{6}{2(-1)} = 3$.\nNow, substitute $l = 3$ into $w = 6-l$ to get $w = 6-3 = 3$.\nThe maximum area occurs when the rectangle is a square with side length 3 inches.\nThe maximum area is $A = lw = 3 \\times 3 = 9$ square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square."
