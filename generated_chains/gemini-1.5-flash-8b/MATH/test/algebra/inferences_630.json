        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe largest value of $x$ that satisfies $\\sqrt{x+1}=x$ can be written as $\\dfrac{a+\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $c$ has no common factor with $a$ and $\\sqrt{b}$ and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1.

        "inference": "The error is in the final step.  The problem asks for the sum $a+b+c$, but $x$ is given as $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, not $x^2$. The problem statement implies that $a = 1, b = 5, c = 2$.  So $\\sqrt{x+1}=x$ implies $x = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$.\nThe solution correctly finds the expression for $x$ using the quadratic formula, but then incorrectly labels the coefficients. We have $x = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The problem should be $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$. The coefficients are $a=1, b=-1, c=-1$.\n$a+b+c = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$",
