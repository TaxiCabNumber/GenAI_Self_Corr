What is the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold?",
        "inference": "Let $f$ be the cost per pound of feathers and $g$ be the cost per ounce of gold.\nFrom the given information, we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $8f + 2g = 932$\n    \\item $14f + 3g = 1402$\n\\end{enumerate}\nMultiply the first equation by 3:\n$24f + 6g = 2796$\nMultiply the second equation by 2:\n$28f + 6g = 2804$\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n$(28f + 6g) - (24f + 6g) = 2804 - 2796$\n$4f = 8$\n$f = 2$\nSubstitute $f = 2$ into the first equation:\n$8(2) + 2g = 932$\n$16 + 2g = 932$\n$2g = 916$\n$g = 458$\nWe want to find the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold:\n$5f + 5g = 5(2) + 5(458) = 10 + 2290 = 2290 + 10 = 2300$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2300}$",

Substituting into the second equation, we solve \\[\n14f+3(466-4f)=1402\n\\]to find $f=2$.  Substituting into $g=466-4f$ we have $g=458$.
