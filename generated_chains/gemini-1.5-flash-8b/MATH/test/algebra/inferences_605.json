At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two solutions for the equation $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$. What is the product of these two solutions?",
        "inference": "The equation is $x^2 - x - 6 = 0$.\nWe can factor the quadratic equation as $(x - 3)(x + 2) = 0$.\nThe solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -2$.\nThe product of the two solutions is $3 \\times (-2) = -6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the product of the roots is $c/a$. Applying this formula to the problem, we have that the product of the two roots is $-6/1=\\boxed{-6}$."
