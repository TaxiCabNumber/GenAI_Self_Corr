        "inference": "Let the increasing arithmetic sequence be $a, b, c, d$. Then $b-a=c-b=d-c=k$ for some positive $k$.\nThus, $b = a+k$, $c = a+2k$, and $d = a+3k$.\nSince $a, b, d$ form a geometric sequence, we have $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{d}{b}$, so\n$$\\frac{a+k}{a} = \\frac{a+3k}{a+k}.$$\nCross-multiplying gives $(a+k)^2 = a(a+3k)$.
