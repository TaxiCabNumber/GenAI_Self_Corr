At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?",
        "inference": "1.  First, determine the time it takes to travel 20 miles at 60 miles per hour.\n    Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / 60 miles/hour = 1/3 hour.\n\n2.  Convert the time from hours to minutes.\n    1/3 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes."
