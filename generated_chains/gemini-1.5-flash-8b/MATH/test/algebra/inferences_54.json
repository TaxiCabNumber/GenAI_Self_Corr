At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
        "inference": "Let $t$ be the number of tickets bought.\nIf $t \\le 60$, the price per ticket is $\\$70$. The total cost is $70t$.\nIf $t > 60$, the price per ticket is $70 - (t-60) = 130 - t$. The total cost is $(130-t)t = 130t - t^2$.\nLet $P(t)$ be the profit.\nIf $t \\le 60$, $P(t) = 70t - C_1$, where $C_1$ is the cost of operating the amusement park.\nIf $t > 60$, $P(t) = (130t - t^2) - C_2$, where $C_2$ is the cost of operating the amusement park.\nThe problem states that the profit is greater than $\\$4200$.\nIf $t \\le 60$, $70t - C_1 > 4200$.\nIf $t > 60$, $130t - t^2 - C_2 > 4200$.\nWe need to find the largest $t$ such that $P(t) > 4200$.\nWe assume the cost $C_1 = C_2 = 0$.\nIf $t \\le 60$, $70t > 4200 \\implies t > 60$.\nIf $t > 60$, $130t - t^2 > 4200 \\implies t^2 - 130t + 4200 < 0$.\nWe need to find the roots of $t^2 - 130t + 4200 = 0$.\nUsing the quadratic formula, $t = \\frac{130 \\pm \\sqrt{130^2 - 4(4200)}}{2} = \\frac{130 \\pm \\sqrt{16900 - 16800}}{2} = \\frac{130 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2} = \\frac{130 \\pm 10}{2}$.\n$t_1 = \\frac{130+10}{2} = \\frac{140}{2} = 70$ and $t_2 = \\frac{130-10}{2} = \\frac{120}{2} = 60$.\nThe inequality $t^2 - 130t + 4200 < 0$ holds for $60 < t < 70$.\nThe largest $t$ is 69.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{69}$",
        "ground_truth": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$."
