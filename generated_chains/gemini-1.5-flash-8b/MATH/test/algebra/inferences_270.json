Four years ago,  Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In four years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now?",
        "inference": "Let Amy's current age be A, Ben's current age be B, and Chris's current age be C.\nThe average of their ages is 6, so\n$$\\frac{A+B+C}{3} = 6 \\implies A+B+C = 18 \\hspace{1cm} (1)$$\nFour years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now, so\n$$C-4 = A \\hspace{1cm} (2)$$\nIn four years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time, so\n$$B+4 = \\frac{3}{5}(A+4) \\hspace{1cm} (3)$$\nFrom (2), $A = C-4$.
