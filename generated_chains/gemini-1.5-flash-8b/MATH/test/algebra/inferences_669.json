At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $c$ is a constant such that $x^2+25x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial, then what is $c$?",
        "inference": "The square of a binomial is of the form $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$.\nComparing this to $x^2+25x+c$, we have $2a=25$, which means $a=\\frac{25}{2}$.\nTherefore, $c=a^2 = (\\frac{25}{2})^2 = \\frac{625}{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{625}{4}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $x^2+25x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.\n\nExpanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. For this to be equal to $x^2+25x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $25$. This gives $a=\\frac{25}2$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{625}4}$."
