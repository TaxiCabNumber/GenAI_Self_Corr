At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30 bricks per hour. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the two of them placed a total of 600 bricks. How many bricks did David lay?",
        "inference": "Alan worked 3 times as many hours as David. Let 'x' be the number of hours David worked. Then Alan worked 3x hours.\nAlan placed 30 bricks per hour, so in 3x hours, Alan placed 30 * 3x = 90x bricks.\nDavid placed 30 bricks per hour, so in x hours, David placed 30 * x = 30x bricks.\nThe total number of bricks placed by both is 600.\nSo, 90x + 30x = 600\n120x = 600\nx = 600 / 120\nx = 5\nDavid worked for 5 hours, and placed 30 bricks/hour * 5 hours = 150 bricks.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks."
