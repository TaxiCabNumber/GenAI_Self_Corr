At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA worker receives an annual wage of $\\$20{,}000$, which he always deposits into a savings account at the end of the year. By the end of the third year (when he makes the third deposit), he wants to have at least $\\$66,200$ in the account to finance the purchase of a house. What is the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide? Express your answer as a percentage, but do not include the percent sign.",
