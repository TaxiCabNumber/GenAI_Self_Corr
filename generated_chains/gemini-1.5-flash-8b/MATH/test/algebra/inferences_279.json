At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree people are standing on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Robert is standing at point $(4,3)$, Lucy at point $(6,1)$, and Liz at point $(1,7)$. How many units away is the farther person from Robert?",

Calculate the distance between Robert (4,3) and Lucy (6,1) using the distance formula:\n   Distance = \u221a((6-4)\u00b2 + (1-3)\u00b2) = \u221a(2\u00b2 + (-2)\u00b2) = \u221a(4 + 4) = \u221a8 = 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.83\n\n2. Calculate the distance between Robert (4,3) and Liz (1,7) using the distance formula:\n   Distance = \u221a((1-4)\u00b2 + (7-3)\u00b2) = \u221a((-3)\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + 16) = \u221a25 = 5\n\n3. Compare the distances: 2\u221a2 \u2248 2.83 and 5. Since 5 > 2.83, the farther person from Robert is Liz.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$\n",
