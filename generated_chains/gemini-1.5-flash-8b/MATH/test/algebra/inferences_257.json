At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 7$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$. What is the area of the square?",
        "inference": "1. Since the side of the square lies on the line $y = 7$, the y-coordinate of the endpoints of the side are 7.\n2. We need to find the x-coordinates of the endpoints by substituting $y = 7$ into the parabola equation:\n   $7 = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$\n3.
