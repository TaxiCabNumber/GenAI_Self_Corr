Thus, $x_2 = \\pm 3$.\nCase 1: $x_2 = 3$.  Then $x_1 = 2(3) = 6$.  From $3x_2 = -b/a$, we have $3(3) = -b/a$, so $9 = -b/a$.\nCase 2: $x_2 = -3$.  Then $x_1 = 2(-3) = -6$.  From $3x_2 = -b/a$, we have $3(-3) = -b/a$, so $-9 = -b/a$.\nIn either case, we have $b/a = \\pm 9$.\nSince we want the largest possible value of $b$, we choose $b/a = 9$.\nIn general, if $x_1 = 2x_2$, then the quadratic can be $x^2 - 3x - 18 = 0$.\nPossible values are $x_1 + x_2 = 9, -9$.
