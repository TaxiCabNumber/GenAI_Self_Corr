I hope it is correct.'\nThe parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and vertex $(h,k)$ is reflected about the line $y=k$. This results in the parabola with equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$?",
        "inference": "Reflecting the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ with vertex $(h,k)$ about the line $y=k$ means that each point $(x,y)$ on the parabola is reflected to the point $(x,2k-y)$ on the new parabola.  Thus, the new parabola equation is $2k-y = ax^2+bx+c$, or $y = -ax^2-bx+(2k-c)$.  Comparing this to $y = dx^2+ex+f$, we have $d=-a, e=-b, f=2k-c$.  So $a+b+c+d+e+f = a+b+c+(-a)+(-b)+(2k-c) = 2k$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2k}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite the equation of the original parabola as $y=f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ (for some $a$). After reflection of the parabola, the equation becomes $y=g(x)=-a(x-h)^2+k$. Notice that $f(x)+g(x)=2k$. Since $f(1)=a+b+c$ and $g(1)=d+e+f$, we have $a+b+c+d+e+f=f(1)+g(1)=\\boxed{2k}$."
