At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLines $y=(3a+2)x-2$ and $2y=(a-4)x+2$ are parallel. What is the value of $a$?",

The slope of this line is $3a+2$.\nThe second line is $2y=(a-4)x+2$, which can be rewritten as $y = \\frac{a-4}{2}x+1$. The slope of this line is $\\frac{a-4}{2}$.\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the slopes are equal:\n$3a+2 = \\frac{a-4}{2}$\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n$2(3a+2) = a-4$\n$6a+4 = a-4$\n$5a = -8$\n$a = -\\frac{8}{5}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We find the slopes of the two lines and set them equal to each other, since parallel lines have the same slope. This gives $3a+2=\\frac{a}{2}-2$, which implies $a=\\boxed{-\\frac{8}{5}}$."
