I hope it is correct.'\nA horse 64 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 27 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 16 feet from the center have to make?",

        "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions."

        "inference": "The problem states that the first horse travels a distance of 2\u03c0r \u00d7 n, where r = 64 and n = 27 revolutions.\nThe distance traveled by the first horse is 2\u03c0(64)(27) = 1728\u03c0 feet.\n\nThe second horse has a radius of 16. Let the number of revolutions it makes be n.\nThe distance traveled by the second horse is 2\u03c0(16)n = 32\u03c0n feet.\n\nThe problem implies that the two horses travel the same distance. Thus,\n1728\u03c0 = 32\u03c0n\nn = 1728\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 1728 / 32 = 54\n\nThus, the second horse makes 54 revolutions.\n\n$\\boxed{54}$\n",
