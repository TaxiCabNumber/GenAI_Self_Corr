        "inference": "1.  Since the parabola contains the point $(-1,0)$, we have $a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 0$, which simplifies to $a - b + c = 0$.\n\n2.  Since the parabola contains the point $(0,5)$, we have $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 5$, which simplifies to $c = 5$.\n\n3.  Since the parabola contains the point $(5,0)$, we have $a(5)^2 + b(5) + c = 0$, which simplifies to $25a + 5b + c = 0$.\n\n4.  Substituting $c=5$ into the first equation, we get $a - b + 5 = 0$, so $a - b = -5$.\n\n5.  Substituting $c=5$ into the third equation, we get $25a + 5b + 5 = 0$, so $25a + 5b = -5$. Dividing by 5, we get $5a + b = -1$.\n\n6.  From $a - b = -5$, we have $b = a + 5$. Substituting this into $5a + b = -1$, we get $5a + (a + 5) = -1$, which simplifies to $6a = -6$, so $a = -1$.\n\n7.  Since $b = a + 5$, we have $b = -1 + 5 = 4$.\n\n8.  We are asked to find the value of $100a + 10b + c$. Substituting $a = -1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 5$ into the expression, we get $100(-1) + 10(4) + 5 = -100 + 40 + 5 = -55$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-55}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the points $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points.  The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \\[a(x-2)^2+k.\\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \\[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\\] or  \\[9a+k=0.\\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \\[5=a(0-2)^2+k\\] or  \\[4a+k=5.\\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \\[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.\n\nSince $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \\[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \\[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\\boxed{-55}.\\]"
