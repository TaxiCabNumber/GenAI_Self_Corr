        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJill is trying to solve the following quadratic equation by completing the square: $$x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0.$$She rewrites this equation in the form of $(ax + b)^2 + c,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are integers. What is $ab$?",
        "inference": "To complete the square for the equation $x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0$, we first move the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n$$x^2 - 8x = 49$$\nNext, we take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term, which is $-8$, and square it: $\\left(\\frac{-8}{2}\\right)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16$. We add this value to both sides of the equation:\n$$x^2 - 8x + 16 = 49 + 16$$\nNow, the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$(x - 4)^2 = 65$$\nThis is in the form $(ax+b)^2 + c$, where $a = 1$, $b = -4$, and $c = 65$.\nWe are asked to find $ab$.\n$$ab = (1)(-4) = -4$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $x^2 - 8x - 49$, we start with $a^2 = 1,$ and so we let $a = 1.$ Then, $2ab = -8,$ so $b = -4.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \\boxed{-4}.$\n\nNote: Letting $a = -1$ gives us $(-x+4)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer."
