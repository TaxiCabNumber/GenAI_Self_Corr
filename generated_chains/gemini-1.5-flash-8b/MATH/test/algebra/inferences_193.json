        "inference": "Let the length and width of the rectangular patio be $l$ and $w$ respectively.\nThe area is given as $180$ square feet, so $lw = 180$.\nThe perimeter is given as $54$ feet, so $2(l+w) = 54$, which simplifies to $l+w = 27$.\nFrom the equation $l+w = 27$, we can express $w$ as $w = 27 - l$.\nSubstituting this into the area equation $lw = 180$, we get $l(27-l) = 180$.\nExpanding this, we have $27l - l^2 = 180$.\nRearranging the equation gives $l^2 - 27l + 180 = 0$.\nWe need to factor this quadratic equation. We are looking for two numbers that multiply to 180 and add up to -27. These numbers are -15 and -12.\nSo, we have $(l-15)(l-12)=0$.\nThis gives us two possible values for $l$: $l = 15$ or $l = 12$.\nIf $l = 15$, then $w = 27 - 15 = 12$.\nIf $l = 12$, then $w = 27 - 12 = 15$.\nIn either case, the dimensions are 12 feet by 15 feet.\nThe length of the diagonal, $d$, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $d^2 = l^2 + w^2$.\n$d^2 = 15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{369}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Set one side of the patio equal to $a$ and the other equal to $b$, producing two equations: \\begin{align*}\nab&=180,\\text{ and}\\\\\n2a+2b&=54.\n\\end{align*}The second equation can be rewritten as $b=27-a$. Substituting, we have \\begin{align*}\n180&=a\\left(27-a\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n180&=27a-a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-180&=a^2-27a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=a^2-27a+180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=\\left(a-12\\right)\\left(a-15\\right).\n\\end{align*}So $12$ feet and $15$ feet are the lengths of the two sides of the patio.
