At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)=\\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^2+4x+c}$ has a domain of all real numbers?",
        "inference": "For the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^2+4x+c}$ to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator $x^2+4x+c$ must not be equal to zero for any real value of $x$.  This means the quadratic $x^2+4x+c$ must never have real roots.  The discriminant of the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $b^2-4ac$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c$ is unknown. For the quadratic to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative.\n\nThus we have:\n$4^2 - 4(1)(c) < 0$\n$16 - 4c < 0$\n$16 < 4c$\n$4 < c$\n\nThe smallest integer value of $c$ that satisfies this inequality is $c=5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The given function has a domain of all real numbers if and only if the denominator is never equal to zero.  In other words, the quadratic $x^2 + 4x + c = 0$ has no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $16 - 4c$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $16 - 4c < 0$, or $c > 4$.  The smallest integer $c$ that satisfies this inequality is $c = \\boxed{5}$."
