At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMike paid $\\$1.25$ for a stamp three years ago. He was just offered double that amount for the stamp. Assuming the stamp's offer price doubles every three years, how many dollars will he be offered in 12 more years?",

In 12 more years, there are 12/3 = 4 doubling periods.\n4. The offer price after 4 doubling periods is $2.50 * 2^4 = $2.50 * 16 = $40.00.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$40.00}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
