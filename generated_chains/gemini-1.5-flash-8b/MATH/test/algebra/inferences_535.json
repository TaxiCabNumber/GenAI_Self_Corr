In this case, we have the sum from $-25$ to $n$ as\n$\\frac{(n+(-25))(n-(-25)+1)}{2} = \\frac{(n-25)(n+26)}{2} = \\frac{n^2+n-650}{2}$.\nWe want this sum to be at least $26$, so we need\n$\\frac{n^2+n-650}{2} \\geq 26$.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we have\n$n^2+n-650 \\geq 52$.\n$n^2+n-702 \\geq 0$.\nWe need to find the roots of $n^2+n-702=0$.
