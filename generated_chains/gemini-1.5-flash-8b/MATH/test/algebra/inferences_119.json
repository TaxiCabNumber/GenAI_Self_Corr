The $y$-intercept occurs when $x=0$. Plugging in $x=0$ into the equation, we get $y = a(0-p)^2 + p = ap^2 + p = -p$. This implies $ap^2 + p = -p$, which simplifies to $ap^2 = -2p$. Since $p \\ne 0$, we can divide by $p$ to get $ap = -2$.\n3. Expanding the vertex form, we have $y = a(x^2 - 2px + p^2) + p = ax^2 - 2apx + ap^2 + p$.\n4. Comparing this to the standard form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $b = -2ap$.\n5. From the equation $ap = -2$, we have $-2ap = -2(-2) = 4$.
