At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEleven pencils cost as much as three pens. If seven pens cost $\\$ 9.24$, what is the cost, in cents, of one pencil?",
        "inference": "1. Find the cost of one pen:\n   Seven pens cost $9.24, so one pen costs $9.24 / 7 = $1.32.\n\n2. Convert the cost of one pen to cents:\n   $1.32 = 132 cents.\n\n3. Find the cost of eleven pencils in cents:\n   Eleven pencils cost as much as three pens, so eleven pencils cost 3 * 132 cents = 396 cents.\n\n4. Find the cost of one pencil in cents:\n   One pencil costs 396 cents / 11 = 36 cents.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If seven pens costs $\\$9.24$, then each pen costs $\\frac{924}{7}=132$ cents. Now we can multiply ratios to find the cost of one pencil. $$\\frac{11\\text{ pencils}}{3 \\text{ pens}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ pen}}{132\\text{ cents}}=\\frac{11}{132\\times3}=\\frac{1}{12\\times3}=\\frac{1 \\text{ pencil}}{36 \\text{ cents}}$$ The ratio is $1$ pencil to $36$ cents, so a pencil costs $\\boxed{36}$ cents."
