        "inference": "The given equation is\n$$(x^2-1)f(x) = 5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17.$$\nIf $x^2-1 = 0$, then $x^2 = 1$, so $x = \\pm 1$.\nIf $x = 1$, we have $(1-1)f(1) = 5(1)^6-1^5+3(1)^4+1^3-25(1)^2+38(1)-17 = 5-1+3+1-25+38-17 = 0$.\nIf $x = -1$, we have $(-1-1)f(-1) = 5(-1)^6-(-1)^5+3(-1)^4+(-1)^3-25(-1)^2+38(-1)-17 = 5-(-1)+3+(-1)-25-38-17 = 0$.\nSince the right side is of degree 6, and the left side is of degree $2+\\text{deg}(f)$, we have\n$$2 + \\text{deg}(f) = 6$$\n$$\\text{deg}(f) = 6 - 2 = 4$$\nSince $f(1)=0$ and $f(-1)=0$, the roots are 1 and -1. Thus $(x-1)(x+1) = x^2-1$ is a factor of the right side.\nBy polynomial division, we can divide $5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17$ by $x^2-1$ to find $f(x)$.\n$$\\frac{5x^6-x^5+3x^4+x^3-25x^2+38x-17}{x^2-1} = 5x^4-x^3+3x^2+x-25+ \\frac{x-2}{x^2-1}$$\nSo $f(x) = 5x^4 - x^3 + 3x^2 + x - 25$.\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is 4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$",
