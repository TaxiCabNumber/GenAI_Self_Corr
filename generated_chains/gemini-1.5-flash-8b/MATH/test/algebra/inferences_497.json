        "ground_truth": "To find the number of criminals that Wonder Woman can capture in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours, we multiply how many criminals she can capture per hour by the number of hours she spends capturing criminals. Thus, she can capture $6 \\cdot (4 \\frac{1}{2})=6 \\cdot \\frac{9}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ criminals in $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ hours."
