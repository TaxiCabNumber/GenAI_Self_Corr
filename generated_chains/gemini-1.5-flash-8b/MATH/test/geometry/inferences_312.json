        "inference": "The trapezoid $OBCD$ has vertices $O(0,0)$, $B(8,0)$, $C(4,3)$, and $D(2,3)$. The height of the trapezoid is the distance between the parallel bases $OB$ and $CD$, which is 3.  The length of the base $OB$ is 8.  The length of the base $CD$ is $4-2=2$.  The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b_1=8$, $b_2=2$, and $h=3$.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} (8 + 2) (3) = \\frac{1}{2} (10) (3) = 15$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{(b_1+b_2)h}{2}$. This trapezoid has bases of $2$ and $8$ units and a height of $3$ units, so the area is $\\frac{(2+8)3}{2}=\\boxed{15}$ square units."
