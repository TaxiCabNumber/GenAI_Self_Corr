At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBy how many degrees does the measure of an interior angle of a regular octagon exceed the measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.\nFor a regular octagon (n=8), the sum of the interior angles is (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees.\nSince it is a regular octagon, each interior angle measures 1080 / 8 = 135 degrees.\nFor a regular hexagon (n=6), the sum of the interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 4 * 180 = 720 degrees.\nSince it is a regular hexagon, each interior angle measures 720 / 6 = 120 degrees.\nThe difference in the measures of the interior angles is 135 - 120 = 15 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the octagon's angles is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = 135^\\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular hexagon has measure $\\frac{720^\\circ}{6} = 120^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the desired difference is $135^\\circ - 120^\\circ = \\boxed{15^\\circ}$."
