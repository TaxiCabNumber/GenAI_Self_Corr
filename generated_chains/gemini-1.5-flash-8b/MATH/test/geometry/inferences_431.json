At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the perimeters of two equilateral triangles is $45$ inches, and the area of the larger one is $16$ times the area of the smaller one. What is the area, in square inches, of the larger triangle? Express your answer in the simplest radical form.",

        "ground_truth": "We set $a$ as the length of the side of the first triangle and $b$ as the length of the side of the second.

Solving and taking the positive root, we get that $b=4a$. Thus, $a+4a=15 \\rightarrow a=3$.
