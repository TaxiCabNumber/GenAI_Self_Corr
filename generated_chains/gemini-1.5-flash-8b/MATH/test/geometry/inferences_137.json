        "inference": "The horizontal base of the trefoil has length 2.  The equilateral triangles have sides of length 2.  The height of each equilateral triangle is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length.  Therefore, the height is $\\sqrt{3}$.  The area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times \\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{3}$.  Since there are three equilateral triangles, their combined area is $3\\sqrt{3}$.  The circular sectors are each $\\frac{1}{6}$ of a circle.  Each sector has a radius of 1.  The area of a sector with a radius of 1 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\pi (1)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.  Since there are 6 sectors, the combined area of the sectors is $6 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\pi$.  The area of the trefoil is the area of the equilateral triangles plus the area of the sectors, minus the area of the overlapped sectors. The overlapped area is the area of a circle with radius 1 minus the area of the sector. That is, $ \\pi - \\pi/6 \\times 3 = \\pi - \\pi/2 = \\pi/2$. Thus the area of the sectors is $6(\\pi/6)= \\pi$.  Therefore, the total area of the trefoil is the area of the three equilateral triangles plus the area of the 6 sectors, minus 6 times the area of the overlapped triangles.  Each equilateral triangle has an area of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The three equilateral triangles have a combined area of $3\\sqrt{3}$.  The total area of the sectors is $\\pi$.  The area of the overlapped regions (3 sectors) is $\\pi/2$, so the area is $3\\sqrt{3} + \\pi - \\pi/2 = 3\\sqrt{3} + \\pi/2$.\n\nThe equilateral triangles have sides of length 2. The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 is $\\sqrt{3}$. The area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.  The area of the three triangles is $3\\sqrt{3}$.  The six circular sectors have radius 1. The area of each sector is $(1/6)\\pi(1)^2=\\pi/6$. The total area of the six sectors is $6(\\pi/6) = \\pi$. The three overlapped sectors together contribute $\\pi/2$. The area of the trefoil is $3\\sqrt{3}+\\pi-\\pi/2 = 3\\sqrt{3} + \\pi/2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$",
