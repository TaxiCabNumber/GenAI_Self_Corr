Meanwhile, $E$ is a point on $AC$ such that $AB \\parallel DE.$ If $BC = 12$  and the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $180,$ what is the area of $ABDE$?",
        "inference": "1. Since $AB = AC$ and $AD$ is an altitude, $AD$ bisects $BC$.  Thus, $BD = DC = \\frac{1}{2} BC = \\frac{1}{2} (12) = 6$.\n\n2. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times BC \\times AD = 180$.  So $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times AD = 180$. This gives $AD = \\frac{180 \\times 2}{12} = 30$.\n\n3. Since $AB \\parallel DE$, $\\triangle ADE \\sim \\triangle ABC$.  The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.  Let $AE = x$.  Since $AB \\parallel DE$, $\\frac{AE}{AC} = \\frac{DE}{BC}$.  Also, since $AB = AC$, $\\frac{AE}{AC} = \\frac{DE}{BC}$.\n\n4.  By the altitude formula, the area of $\\triangle ADE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AE \\times h$, where $h$ is the height from $D$ to $AE$.  Since $AB \\parallel DE$, the altitude from $D$ to $AE$ is the same as the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. Thus, $h = AD = 30$.\n\n\n5. We know that the ratio of the sides is $\\frac{AE}{AC}$.\n$\\frac{Area(\\triangle ADE)}{Area(\\triangle ABC)} = \\frac{AE^2}{AC^2}$.\nWe know the area of $\\triangle ABC = 180$.\nLet $\\frac{AE}{AC} = k$, then $AE = kAC$.\nSince $AB = AC$, we have $AE = k AC = k AB$.\nSo $\\frac{AE}{AC} = k = \\frac{x}{AC}$, and $\\frac{Area(\\triangle ADE)}{Area(\\triangle ABC)} = k^2 = \\left(\\frac{x}{AC}\\right)^2$.\n\n6.  Since $AB \\parallel DE$, the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ is also the altitude from $D$ to $AE$, which is $30$.\nThe area of $\\triangle ADE = \\frac{1}{2} AE \\times AD = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AE \\times 30$.\n\n7. The area of $\\triangle ADE = k^2 \\times \\text{Area}(\\triangle ABC)$.\nSince $AE$ is part of the side $AC$ which is equal to $AB$, $\\frac{AE}{AC} = \\frac{x}{AC}$.\nIf $AC = x$, $AE = x/2$, then $\\frac{Area(\\triangle ADE)}{Area(\\triangle ABC)} = (\\frac{AE}{AC})^2$.\n\n\n8. Let $AE = x$.\nSince $AE/AC = x/AC = x/AB$ and $AB \\parallel DE$, the ratio of the heights from A and D to their bases BC and AE is $\\frac{DE}{BC}$. The areas of triangles $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle ABC$ are related as:\n$\\frac{Area(\\triangle ADE)}{Area(\\triangle ABC)} = \\frac{AE^2}{AC^2}$.\n\n9. We know that the ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of the sides:  $\\frac{AE^2}{AC^2} = \\frac{Area(ADE)}{Area(ABC)} = \\frac{Area(ADE)}{180}$.\n\n\n10. The area of $ABDE = 180 - (\\frac{1}{4})180 = 135.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}$",
