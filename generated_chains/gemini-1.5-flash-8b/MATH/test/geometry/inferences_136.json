        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many of the letters in MATHCOUNTS have a horizontal line of symmetry?",
        "inference": "1. Identify the letters in MATHCOUNTS: M, A, T, H, C, O, U, N, T, S.\n2. Analyze each letter for horizontal line symmetry.\n   - M: Yes\n   - A: No\n   - T: No\n   - H: Yes\n   - C: No\n   - O: Yes\n   - U: No\n   - N: No\n   - T: No\n   - S: No\n3. Count the letters with horizontal line symmetry: M, H, O\n4. There are 3 letters with horizontal line symmetry.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We look at how many of the letters can be cut in half horizontally and are symmetrical across that line. For instance, with C, we can draw a horizontal line through it and the top and bottom halves are reflections of each other across the line. We find that only H, C, and O have a horizontal line of symmetry, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ letters."
