At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the volume of a 2-cm-by-2cm-by-2cm cube is increased by 19 cubic centimeters to form a larger cube, what is the length in centimeters of one edge of the new cube?",
        "inference": "Original volume = 2cm * 2cm * 2cm = 8 cubic cm.\nIncreased volume = 8 cubic cm + 19 cubic cm = 27 cubic cm.\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of an edge.\n27 cubic cm = s^3\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\ns = \u221b27 = 3 cm\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of the $2$-cm cube is $2^3=8$ cubic centimeters. The volume of the larger cube is $8+19=27$, so the length of one edge is $\\sqrt[3]{27}=\\boxed{3}$ cm."

This means the new volume is 8 + 19 = 27 cubic cm.\n\nThe formula for the volume of a cube is V = s\u00b3.  If the new volume is 27 cubic cm, then 27 = s\u00b3.
