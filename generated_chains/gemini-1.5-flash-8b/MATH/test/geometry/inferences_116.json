At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right square pyramid has a base with edges each measuring 3 cm and a height twice the perimeter of its base. What is the volume of the pyramid?",
        "inference": "1. The perimeter of the base is 4 * 3 cm = 12 cm.\n2. The height of the pyramid is 2 * 12 cm = 24 cm.\n3. The area of the base is 3 cm * 3 cm = 9 sq cm.\n4. The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height.\n5. Volume = (1/3) * 9 sq cm * 24 cm = 72 cubic cm.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of the base is $4\\cdot 3 = 12$ cm, so the height of the pyramid is $2\\cdot 12 = 24$ cm.  The base has area $3^2 = 9$ square cm.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $9\\cdot 24/3=\\boxed{72}$ cubic cm."
