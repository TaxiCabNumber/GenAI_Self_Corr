        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMrs. Read can knit one pair of children's mittens with a ball of yarn six inches in diameter. How many pairs of identical mittens can she knit with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter? Assume that the balls of yarn are rolled consistently.",
        "inference": "The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3.\nFor a ball of yarn six inches in diameter, the radius is 3 inches.\nThe volume of this ball is V\u2081 = (4/3)\u03c0(3\u00b3) = 36\u03c0 cubic inches.\nFor a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter, the radius is 6 inches.\nThe volume of this ball is V\u2082 = (4/3)\u03c0(6\u00b3) = 288\u03c0 cubic inches.\nSince the volume of the larger ball is 288\u03c0 / 36\u03c0 = 8 times larger than the smaller ball, Mrs. Read can knit 8 pairs of mittens with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "A ball of yarn 12 inches in diameter has twice the diameter of a ball of yarn 6 inches in diameter.  Let the radius of the small ball be $r$ and the radius of the large ball be $2r$.  Then, the volume of the small ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the large ball is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2r)^3 = 8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Hence the large ball has 8 times the volume of the small ball, so Mrs. Read can knit $\\boxed{8}$ pairs of identical mittens with the large yarn ball."

        "inference": "The problem states that Mrs. Read can knit 8 pairs of mittens with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter.  The question is likely asking how many pairs of mittens she can knit with a ball of yarn of a certain diameter, based on the volume of yarn.  The provided calculations are correct.  Thus, the answer is 8 pairs.\n$\\boxed{8}$\n",
