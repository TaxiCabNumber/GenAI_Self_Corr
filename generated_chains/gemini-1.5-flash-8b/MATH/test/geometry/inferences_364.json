        "inference": "The problem states $\\overline{AB} \\parallel \\overline{CD}$.

This contradicts the statement that $\\angle ADC = 50^\\circ$.\nThus the information provided about $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{CD}$ and $\\angle DAB = \\angle ADC = 50^\\circ$ is inconsistent.  Therefore, the problem cannot be solved. The length of arc $\\widehat{AB}$ cannot be determined with the given information.\n\nThe arc length of $\\widehat{AB}$ depends on the radius and the central angle formed by the radii that form the endpoints of $\\widehat{AB}$. We don't have enough information about the central angle.\n\nThe error lies in the assumption that $\\angle DAB$ intercepts $\\widehat{DB}$. Also, the solution improperly concludes $\\angle DAB = 50^\\circ$, $\\angle ADC=50^\\circ$, and then proceeds to solve for the arc length.\n\nSince there's a contradiction, the provided information doesn't allow us to find the arc length.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{10\\pi}$",
