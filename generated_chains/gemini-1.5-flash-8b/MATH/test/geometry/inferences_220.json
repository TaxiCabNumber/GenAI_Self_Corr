At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle of side 12 centimeters is rotated about an altitude to form a cone. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone?",
        "inference": "The altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length 12 cm is given by the formula  $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s$, where $s$ is the side length.  So, $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\sqrt{3}$ cm.\n\nThe radius of the base of the cone is half the side length of the equilateral triangle, which is  $r = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$ cm.\n\nThe volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (6^2)(6\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (36)(6\\sqrt{3}) = 72\\pi\\sqrt{3}$ cubic cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72\\sqrt{3}\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
