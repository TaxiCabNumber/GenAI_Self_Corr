We don't know PM.\nIf M is the midpoint of QR, this is not enough information to solve for QM.  Thus, the problem statement must be incorrect.\n\nIf M is the midpoint of PR, as in the initial solution, then  $PM = \\frac{1}{2} PR = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 = 16$. \nThen\n$1090 = QM^2 + 16^2$\n$1090 = QM^2 + 256$\n$QM^2 = 834$\n$QM = \\sqrt{834}$\n\nHowever, the original solution assumed M was the midpoint of PR and then correctly applied Apollonius' Theorem.\nGiven the problem statement, the correct solution for QM assumes M is the midpoint of PR.
