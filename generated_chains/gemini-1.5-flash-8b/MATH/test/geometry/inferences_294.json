        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cube of side 3 inches has a cube of side 1 inch cut from each corner. A cube of side 2 inches is then inserted in each corner. What is the number of square inches in the surface area of the resulting solid?",
        "inference": "1. Original cube surface area: 6 * (3 inches)^2 = 54 square inches.\n2. Area of 8 corner cubes removed: 8 * 6 * (1 inch)^2 = 48 square inches.\n3. Area of 8 corner cubes added: 8 * 6 * (2 inches)^2 = 192 square inches.\n4. Net change in surface area from removing the corner cubes is -48 square inches.\n5. Net change in surface area from adding the corner cubes is +192 square inches.\n6. Total change in surface area: -48 + 192 = 144 square inches.\n7. Final surface area: 54 + 144 = 198 square inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{198}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Our initial cube has 6 faces with 9 square inches of surface area each for a total of 54 square inches. When we cut away the 8 cubes of side length one, we remove 3 square inches of surface area for each one for a total of 24 square inches of surface area lost. We then add a 2 inch cube to each corner for a total of 8 more cubes. A 2 inch cube has a surface area of 24 but each of these cubes is missing 3 $\\text{in}^2$ of surface area, so the total surface area is $54-24+8(24-3)=\\boxed{198}$ square inches."

        "inference": "Let the original cube have side length 3 inches.\nThe original surface area is $6 \\times (3^2) = 54$ square inches.\nWhen 8 corner cubes are removed, the surface area of the original cube is reduced. The surface area of each corner cube is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$ square inches.\nSince 8 corner cubes are removed, the reduction in surface area is $8 \\times 6 = 48$ square inches.\nThe new surface area is $54 - 48 = 6$ square inches.\nWhen 8 corner cubes are added, the surface area of the original cube is increased.
