At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has leg lengths of 8 and 15 units. What is the length, in units, of the median to the hypotenuse? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.\n   median = (1/2) * 17 = 8.5\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "$8^2+15^2=289=17^2$, so the hypotenuse has length $17$.  The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is a radius of the circumcircle, while the hypotenuse is a diameter.  So the median is half as long as the hypotenuse, and thus has length $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$."
