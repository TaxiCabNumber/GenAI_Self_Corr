        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.",
        "inference": "Surface area of a sphere is given by $4\\pi r^2$.\nWe are given that the surface area is $196\\pi$.\nSo, $4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi$.\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we have $4r^2 = 196$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we have $r^2 = 49$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $r = 7$ inches.\nThe circumference of a great circle of a sphere is given by $2\\pi r$.\nSubstituting $r = 7$, we have $2\\pi (7) = 14\\pi$ inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi.\\] Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$ yields $r^2 = 49$; taking the square root of both sides and keeping the positive solution yields $r=7$ inches.\n\nA great circle of a sphere is the circular cross-section of the sphere that passes through the sphere's center, which, in this case, is a circle with radius 7.  The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches."
