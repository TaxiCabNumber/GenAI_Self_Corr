Finally, we must consider the case of inscribed polyhedra for which the center of the sphere does not lie inside the polyhedron. However, in this case, we can still construct pyramids with apex $O$ whose bases are the faces of $P$; then the surface area of $P$ is still the sum of the areas of the bases, but the volume of $P$ is less than the total volume of the pyramids. This only strengthens the argument for an upper bound of $12$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
