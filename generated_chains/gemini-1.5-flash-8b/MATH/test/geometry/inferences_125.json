This is incorrect.\n\nThe correct calculation is:  The side length of the octagon is the difference between the side of the square and 2 times the leg of the triangle. The leg length of the triangle is $1000\\sqrt{2}$. The side of the octagon is $2000 - 2(1000\\sqrt{2} / \\sqrt{2}) = 2000 - 2(1000) = 2000 - 2000 = 0$. This is incorrect.\n\nThe side length of the octagon is the side length of the square minus 2 times the leg length of the removed right triangle. The leg length is $1000\\sqrt{2}$.

Removing a 45-45-90 triangle from a corner leaves a length of $2000 - 1000\\sqrt{2}$.

This is the side of the square - 2x.\nThe side of the octagon is $2000 - 2\\times 1000 = 2000 - 2000 = 0$.
