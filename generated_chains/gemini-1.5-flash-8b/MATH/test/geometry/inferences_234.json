I hope it is correct.'\nAn isosceles trapezoid has sides of length 4 cm, 10 cm, 16 cm and 10 cm. What is the area of this trapezoid, in square centimeters?",
        "inference": "Let the trapezoid be ABCD, with AB = 4, BC = 10, CD = 16, and AD = 10.\nSince it is an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal in length.  The height of the trapezoid can be found by dropping perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base.  Let these points be E and F. Then AE = BF and CE = DF.  Since AB = 4 and CD = 16, and the trapezoid is isosceles, CE = DF = (16-4)/2 = 6.\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle ADE, we have AE^2 + DE^2 = AD^2.\nWe also have DE = CE = 6.\nAE^2 + 6^2 = 10^2\nAE^2 + 36 = 100\nAE^2 = 64\nAE = 8.\nThe area of the trapezoid is given by (1/2)(sum of bases)(height).\nThe bases are AB = 4 and CD = 16.  The height is AE = 8.\nArea = (1/2)(4+16)(8) = (1/2)(20)(8) = 10(8) = 80.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We drop an altitude from either vertex of the shorter base, forming a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 10 and one leg of length $(16 - 4)/2 = 6$. The remaining leg, which is the height of the trapezoid, is thus 8.\n\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{4 + 16}{2}\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{80}$ square centimeters."
