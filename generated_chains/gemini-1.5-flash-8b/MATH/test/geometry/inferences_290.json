        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?",
        "inference": "The label covers the lateral surface area of the cylinder.\nThe lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by $2\\pi rh$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.\nWe are given that the height $h=6$ inches and the area of the label is $60\\pi$ square inches.\nSo, $2\\pi rh = 60\\pi$.\nSubstituting $h=6$, we get $2\\pi r(6) = 60\\pi$.\n$12\\pi r = 60\\pi$.\nDividing both sides by $12\\pi$, we get\n$r = \\frac{60\\pi}{12\\pi}$.\n$r = 5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$."
