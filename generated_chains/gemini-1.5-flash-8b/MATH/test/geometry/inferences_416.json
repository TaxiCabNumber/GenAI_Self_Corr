At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right square pyramid's base has edges measuring 20 feet each. If the pyramid's height is 27 feet, what is its volume, in cubic feet?",
        "inference": "1. The base is a square with side length 20 feet.  The area of the base is 20 * 20 = 400 square feet.\n\n2. The height of the pyramid is 27 feet.\n\n3. The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula (1/3) * base area * height.\n\n4. Volume = (1/3) * 400 sq ft * 27 ft = 400 * 9 cubic feet = 3600 cubic feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3600}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
