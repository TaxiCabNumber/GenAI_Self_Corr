        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle with sides measuring 8, 15 and 17 units is inscribed in a circle. What is the radius of the circle, in units? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "1. The triangle with sides 8, 15, and 17 is a right triangle. This is because $8^2 + 15^2 = 64 + 225 = 289 = 17^2$.\n\n2. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 15 = 60$.\n\n3. The radius of the circumscribed circle for a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the radius is $\\frac{17}{2} = 8.5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8.5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "An $8-15-17$ triangle is always right. It follows that the hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle, and the radius must be half the hypotenuse, or $\\frac{17}{2} = \\boxed{8.5}$."
