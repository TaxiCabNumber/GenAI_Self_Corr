        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?",
        "inference": "1 cubic foot = 12 inches * 12 inches * 12 inches = 1728 cubic inches.\nThe volume of a cube is given by side^3.\nSo, side^3 = 1728.\nTaking the cube root of both sides, side = $\\sqrt[3]{1728} = 12$ inches.\nThe surface area of a cube is given by 6 * side^2.\nSurface area = 6 * (12 inches)^2 = 6 * 144 square inches = 864 square inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{864}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that  $$1 \\mbox{ foot} = 12 \\mbox{ inches}$$\n\nHence $$1 \\mbox{ foot}^2 = 12^2 \\mbox{ inches}^2 = 144 \\mbox{ inches}^2$$\n\nFinally, remember the formula $V = l \\times w \\times h$, that is, Volume is the product of length, width, and height.\n\nThe length, height, and width for a cube are equal, so the cube we are given has sides of length $1 \\mbox{ feet}$. Now, a cube has 6 faces, so the surface area of our cube is $$6 \\times (1 \\mbox{ foot} \\times 1 \\mbox{ foot}) = 6 \\mbox{ feet}^2$$\n\nNow, convert: $$ 6 \\mbox{ feet}^2 \\frac{144 \\mbox{ inches}^2}{1 \\mbox{ foot}^2} = 864 \\mbox{ inches}^2$$\n\nSo, our final answer is $\\boxed{864 \\mbox{ inches}^2}$"
