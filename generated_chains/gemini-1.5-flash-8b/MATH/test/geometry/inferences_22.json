        "inference": "The area of a triangle inscribed in a circle is maximized when the triangle is a right triangle with the diameter of the circle as its hypotenuse.  Given a diameter of 100, the hypotenuse has length 100.  Let the legs of the right triangle be $a$ and $b$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = 100^2 = 10000$.
