        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA water tank in the shape of a right circular cylinder has a base radius of $30$ meters and a volume of $2700\\pi$ cubic meters. What is the number of meters in the height of the tank?",
        "inference": "The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height. We are given that the radius $r = 30$ meters and the volume $V = 2700\\pi$ cubic meters. We need to find the height $h$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we have:\n$2700\\pi = \\pi (30^2) h$\n$2700\\pi = \\pi (900) h$\nNow, divide both sides by $\\pi$ and by 900:\n$\\frac{2700\\pi}{\\pi \\times 900} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 900 \\times h}{\\pi \\times 900}$\n$3 = h$\nTherefore, the height of the tank is 3 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters."
