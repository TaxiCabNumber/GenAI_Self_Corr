We need to approximate the value of $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the final numerical answer. \n$\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732$\n(3\u221a3/4) $\\approx$ (3 * 1.732/4) = 1.299 ft^2\nTotal surface area $\\approx$ 1.299 ft^2 + 9 ft^2 $\\approx$ 10.299 ft^2. \n\nThe problem likely intends to find the total surface area of the prism. The answer is the sum of the area of the two hexagonal bases and the 6 rectangular faces: (3\u221a3/4) + 9.  \nThe question asks for the area of the rectangular faces.
