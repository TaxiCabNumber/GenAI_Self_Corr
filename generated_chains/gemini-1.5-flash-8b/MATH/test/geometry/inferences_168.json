        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?",
        "inference": "The angle between the 3 and 9 on a clock is 180 degrees.\nThe angle between the 2 and 10 on a clock is 160 degrees.\nThe difference in the angles is 180 - 160 = 20 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "From ``$3$'' to ``$9$'' is a difference of 6 hours out of the 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$ of the degrees on the clock. From ``$2$'' to ``$10$,'' the smaller angle (clockwise from $10$ to $2$) is a difference of 4 hours out of 12 on the clock, so the hands are separated by $\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the degrees on the clock. The difference in the angles is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the degrees on the clock. Since the clock has $360^\\circ$, the angle decreases by $\\frac{360}{6}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$."
