At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty-seven solid gold spherical beads each of radius 3 are melted down and recast into a larger, solid gold sphere. How many units are in the radius of this larger gold sphere?",

Volume of the larger sphere:  972\u03c0\n4. Let R be the radius of the larger sphere.  Then (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3 = 972\u03c0\n5. Divide both sides by (4/3)\u03c0: R\u00b3 = 972\u03c0 * (3/4\u03c0) = 729\n6. Take the cube root of both sides: R = \u221b729\n7. R = 9\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
