The intersection point of $y=0$ and $x+3y=12$ is (12,0). To find the intersection of the last 2 lines, we substitute the first equation for $y$ and then solve for $x$.

Let the base of the triangle be the side of the triangle on the $x$-axis. Because this side is between the points (-4,0) and (12,0), its length is $12-(-4)=12+4=16$. The height must be perpendicular to this side and through the final vertex. This is along the $y$-axis. Thus, the height of the triangle is just the $y$-coordinate of the other point, which is 4.
