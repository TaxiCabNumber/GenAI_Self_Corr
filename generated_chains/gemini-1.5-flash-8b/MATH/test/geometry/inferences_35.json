        "inference": "1. The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.\n2. We are given that the volume $V = 63,960$ cubic meters and the height $h = 30$ meters.\n3. We can solve for the area of the base $B$ using the formula: $B = \\frac{3V}{h} = \\frac{3(63,960)}{30} = 6396$ square meters.\n4. Since the base is a square, the area of the square base is $s^2 = 6396$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square base.\n5. Therefore, $s = \\sqrt{6396} = 79.975 \\approx 80$ meters.\n6. The lateral height ($\\overline{AB}$) forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. One leg of the triangle is half the length of the base, and the other leg is the height of the pyramid.\n7. The length of half the base is $s/2 = 80/2 = 40$ meters.\n8. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $(\\overline{AB})^2 = (s/2)^2 + h^2$.\n9. Substituting the values we have: $(\\overline{AB})^2 = (40)^2 + (30)^2 = 1600 + 900 = 2500$.\n10.
