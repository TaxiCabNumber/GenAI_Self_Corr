        "ground_truth": "The diagonal of a square is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 right triangle whose legs are the sides of the square.  Therefore, the diagonal of the square measures $12\\sqrt{2}$ units.  The diagonal of the square is a diameter of the circle, so the radius of the circle is $6\\sqrt{2}$ units.
