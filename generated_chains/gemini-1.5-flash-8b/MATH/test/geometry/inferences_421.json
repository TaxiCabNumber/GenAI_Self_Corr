We know that the angles which are not right must have measure less than 180 if the polygon is to be convex.  So, let $n$ equal the number of right angles in the octagon.  The average measure of the remaining angles must be less than $180^{\\circ}$, which is equivalent to: $$\\frac{1080-90n}{8-n}<180$$ We can simplify this inequality: $$1080-90n<1440-180n$$ $$90n<360$$ $$n<4$$ So, the greatest possible number of right angles will be $\\boxed{3}$."

        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of an octagon is (8-2) * 180 = 1080 degrees.  If an octagon has *n* right angles (90 degrees each), the sum of the remaining (8-n) angles must be 1080 - 90n.  For the remaining angles to be interior angles, each must be less than 180 degrees.  Thus, (8-n) * 179 < 1080 - 90n.  This simplifies to 1432 - 179n < 1080 - 90n, which leads to 352 < 89n.  Solving for n gives n < 3.92.  Since n must be an integer, the maximum number of right angles is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
