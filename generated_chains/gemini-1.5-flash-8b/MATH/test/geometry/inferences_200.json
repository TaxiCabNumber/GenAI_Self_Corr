Since the angle at Z is 90 degrees, we can consider the right triangle XYZ.\n4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: XY^2 + YZ^2 = XZ^2  =>  96^2 + YZ^2 = 104^2\n5. Solving for YZ: YZ^2 = 104^2 - 96^2 = 10816 - 9216 = 1600\n6. YZ = sqrt(1600) = 40\n7. The area of the trapezoid XYZW is given by the formula: Area = (1/2)(sum of parallel sides)(height).\n8. The parallel sides are XY and ZW.\n9. The height is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides, which is YZ in this case.\n10. Therefore, Area = (1/2)(XY + ZW)(YZ) = (1/2)(96 + 24)(40) = (1/2)(120)(40) = 60(40) = 2400.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2400}$",
