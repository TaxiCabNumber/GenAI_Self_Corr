        "inference": "The problem statement is ambiguous.  We need more information about the relationship between the pentagon, quadrilateral, and heptagon.  To solve for x, we need an equation relating the angles in the pentagon, quadrilateral, and the two angles adjacent to x.  Without that, x is indeterminate.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement intends that the heptagon has an interior vertex where the pentagon and quadrilateral share a common side with the heptagon.  If so, x is the interior angle at that common vertex.\n\nThe angle at vertex x is part of the quadrilateral.  The two exterior angles at the vertex are related to the two interior angles adjacent to the common side.  Since the pentagon and quadrilateral share a side, the two exterior angles at the vertex where the pentagon and quadrilateral meet sum to the interior angle at that vertex in the heptagon.\n\n2 * (360/7) = 720/7\n\nSum of interior angles in a pentagon = 540 degrees\nSum of interior angles in a quadrilateral = 360 degrees\nSum of interior angles in a heptagon = 900 degrees\n\nLet the two angles in the heptagon adjacent to x be a and b.\nIn the heptagon, we have a + b + x = 900/7\n\nIn the quadrilateral, let the two interior angles be y and z.  y + z = 180 - (360/7)\n\n\nWe need an explicit connection between the angles in the figure.  Without that, x is not determinable.\n\nHowever, if we assume the angles in the heptagon, pentagon, and quadrilateral are all interior angles, the solution is:\n\nx + 2 * (360/7) = 180\nx = 180 - 720/7 = (1260 - 720)/7 = 540/7\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{540}{7}}$\n",
