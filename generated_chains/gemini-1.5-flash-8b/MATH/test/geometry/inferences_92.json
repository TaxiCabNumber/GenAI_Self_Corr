At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many edges does a hexagonal prism have?",
        "inference": "A hexagonal prism has two hexagonal bases and six rectangular faces connecting the corresponding vertices of the hexagons.\nEach hexagon has 6 edges.\nThe two hexagons have 6 * 2 = 12 edges.\nThe six rectangular faces have 6 * 4 = 24 edges.\nHowever, the edges of the rectangular faces are shared between two faces. Thus, the total number of edges is (12 + 24) / 2 = 18 edges.\nThe two hexagons have 6 edges each, for a total of 12 edges.\nThe rectangular faces have 4 edges each, for a total of 6 * 4 = 24 edges.\nBut, the rectangular edges are shared, so we divide the total edges by 2: (12 + 24) / 2 = 36/2 = 18 edges.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two bases on the prism, each with six edges, for a total of 12 base edges. Each vertex on a base is connected to a corresponding vertex on the other base, and since each base has six vertices, there are 6 vertical edges. In total, there are $12+6=\\boxed{18}$ edges."
