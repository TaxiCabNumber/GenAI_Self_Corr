        "inference": "Rotating the darker figure counterclockwise about point $C$ to the lighter figure, we observe that the point at $(-4,1)$ maps to $(-4,3)$.  The angle of rotation is determined by the angle between the segments from $C$ to the corresponding points.  We see that the segment from $C(0,1)$ to $(-4,1)$ is vertical. The segment from $C(0,1)$ to $(-4,3)$ is the segment from $(0,1)$ to $(-4,3)$. The segment length is $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(3-1)^2} = \\sqrt{16+4} = \\sqrt{20}$. The angle is measured by arctan$\\left(\\frac{3-1}{-4-0}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{-4}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.  Since the rotation is counterclockwise, the angle is $180^\\circ-\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.  The segment from $C$ to $(-4,1)$ has a slope of $0$ and the segment from $C$ to $(-4,3)$ has a slope of $\\frac{3-1}{-4-0} = \\frac{2}{-4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. The angle is $90^{\\circ}+(-26.56^{\\circ}) = 63.43^{\\circ}$.\nThe segment from $C(0,1)$ to $(-4,1)$ is horizontal, while the segment from $C(0,1)$ to $(-4,3)$ is at an angle.  The angle formed by the segments from $C$ to these corresponding points is $90^\\circ$. The point on the darker figure $(-4,1)$ is mapped to $(-4,3)$.\nThe angle of rotation about C is $\\arctan\\frac{2}{-4} = -\\arctan\\frac{1}{2}$ which is approximately $-26.57^\\circ$.  The counterclockwise rotation is $180^\\circ-26.57^\\circ = 153.43^\\circ$.\nFrom $(0,1)$ to $(-4,1)$ is a horizontal segment. From $(0,1)$ to $(-4,3)$ is a segment with slope $2/-4=-1/2$.  We have a vertical to a segment with slope $-1/2$.  $\\arctan (-1/2) \\approx -26.57^{\\circ}$ from the horizontal.  The counterclockwise rotation from $(-4,1)$ to $(-4,3)$ is $90^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$",
        "ground_truth": "By looking at the diagram provided, we can see that the line containing the point of rotation lands on top of itself, but the arrow is facing the opposite direction. This tells us that 1/2 of a full $360^{\\circ}$ rotation was completed; therefore, the image rotated $360^{\\circ}/2 = \\boxed{180^{\\circ}}$ about point $C$."
