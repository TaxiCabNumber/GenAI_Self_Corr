        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right cylindrical tank with circular bases is being filled with water at a rate of $20\\pi$ cubic meters per hour. As the tank is filled, the water level rises four meters per hour. What is the radius of the tank, in meters? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let $V$ be the volume of water in the tank, $r$ be the radius of the tank, and $h$ be the height of the water in the tank.\nThe volume of water in the tank is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \\pi r^2 h$.\nWe are given that the water is being filled at a rate of $20\\pi$ cubic meters per hour, so $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\\pi$.\nWe are also given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so $\\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$.\nWe have the equation $V = \\pi r^2 h$. Differentiating both sides with respect to time $t$, we get:\n$\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dh}{dt} + \\pi 2rh \\frac{dr}{dt}$\nSince the radius of the tank is constant, $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$.\nSo, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dh}{dt}$.\nWe are given $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\\pi$ and $\\frac{dh}{dt} = 4$.\nPlugging in the values, we have\n$20\\pi = \\pi r^2 (4)$\n$20 = 4r^2$\n$r^2 = 5$\n$r = \\sqrt{5}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$\n",
