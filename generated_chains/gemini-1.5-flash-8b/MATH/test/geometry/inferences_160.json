        "inference": "Let the smallest interior angle be $x$.  Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two non-parallel sides are equal in length, and the base angles on each leg are equal. The largest interior angle is 4 times the smallest interior angle, so the largest angle is $4x$. The sum of the interior angles of a trapezoid is 360 degrees.  The two parallel sides have opposite interior angles that add up to 180 degrees.  Let the two base angles be $x$ each. The two angles formed by the non-parallel sides are $4x$ and $x$. Thus the angles are $x, x, 4x, 180 - 4x$. The sum of the angles is $x + x + 4x + (180 - 4x) = 360$. This simplifies to $2x + 180 = 360$, so $2x = 180$, and $x = 90$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$",
