At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA gecko is in a room that is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall. The gecko is currently on a side wall ($10^{\\prime}$ by $8^{\\prime}$), one foot from the ceiling and one foot from the back wall ($12^{\\prime}$ by $8^{\\prime}$). The gecko spots a fly on the opposite side wall, one foot from the floor and one foot from the front wall. What is the length of the shortest path the gecko can take to reach the fly assuming that it does not jump and can only walk across the ceiling and the walls?

We can ``unfold'' the walls that the gecko traveled along, as below, to represent the gecko's path in two dimensions. This unfolding does not change the length of the gecko's path, so in order for the gecko's path to be minimal before unfolding, it must be minimal after unfolding. In other words, it must be a straight line after unfolding. Now, besides the side walls, the gecko can travel along the front, back, and ceiling. Suppose that among these, it only travels along the front wall. The walls the gecko walked along unfold as such: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(10,0)--(10,8)--(0,8)--cycle ); draw( (10,0)--(22,0) ); draw( (10,8)--(22,8) );\ndraw( (22,0)--(32,0)--(32,8)--(22,8)--cycle );\npair g = (31,7); pair f = (9,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(31,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(31,1), red+dashed);\nlabel( \"10\", (0,0)--(10,0) ); label( \"12\", (10,0)--(22,0) ); label( \"10\", (22,0)--(32,0) ); label( \"8\", (32,0)--(32,8) );\n[/asy] The gecko's path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 6 and 22, so its length is $\\sqrt{6^2 + 22^2} = 2\\sqrt{3^2 + 11^2} = 2\\sqrt{130}$. By symmetry (the gecko and the fly are exactly opposite each other in the room), the path length is the same if the gecko only travels along the back wall and side walls.\n\nNow suppose the gecko only travels along the ceiling and side walls. These walls unfolded become: [asy]\ndraw( (0,0)--(8,0)--(8,10)--(0,10)--cycle ); draw( (8,0)--(20,0) ); draw( (8,10)--(20,10) );\ndraw( (20,0)--(28,0)--(28,10)--(20,10)--cycle );\npair g = (21,9); pair f = (1,1);\ndot(g, green); dot(f, purple);\ndraw(g--f, red);\ndraw(f--(21,1), red+dashed); draw(g--(21,1), red+dashed);\nlabel( \"8\", (0,0)--(8,0) ); label( \"12\", (8,0)--(20,0) ); label( \"8\", (20,0)--(28,0) ); label( \"10\", (28,0)--(28,10) );\n[/asy] The path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 8 and 20, so its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 + 20^2} = 2\\sqrt{4^2+10^2} = 2\\sqrt{116}$.
