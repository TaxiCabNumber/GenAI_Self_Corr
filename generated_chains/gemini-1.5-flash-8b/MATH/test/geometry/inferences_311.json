        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the diagram, the two triangles shown have parallel bases. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the larger triangle? Express your answer as a common fraction. [asy] path p = (0,0)--dir(-60)--dir(-120)--(0,0);\ndraw(p); draw(scale(3)*p);\nlabel(\"4 cm\",dir(-60)--dir(-120),S); label(\"10 cm\",3*dir(-60)--3dir(-120),S);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The smaller triangle has a base of 4 cm and the larger triangle has a base of 10 cm.  Since the triangles have the same height, the ratio of their areas is the ratio of the squares of their corresponding sides.  The ratio of the bases is 4/10 = 2/5.  The ratio of the areas is (2/5)^2 = 4/25.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{25}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because of our parallel bases, we can see that corresponding angles of the triangles must be congruent. Therefore, by AA similarity, we see that the two triangles are similar.\n\nIf two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ In our diagram, we see that the ratio of the sides of the smaller triangle to the sides of the larger triangle is $\\dfrac{4\\text{ cm}}{10\\text{ cm}} = \\dfrac{2}{5}.$ Therefore, the ratio of the areas is the square of that, or $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{25}}.$"
