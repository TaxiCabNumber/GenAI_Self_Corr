        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSean has 12 cylindrical containers filled with sand, each of which has a radius of 4 centimeters. He wants to transfer his sand into some new cylindrical containers, which are the same height but have a radius of 8 centimeters. How many new containers will Sean need?",
        "inference": "1. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n2. The volume of sand in each of the 12 small containers is 12 * \u03c0 * (4 cm)\u00b2 * h = 192\u03c0h cubic centimeters.\n3. The volume of sand in one of the large containers is \u03c0 * (8 cm)\u00b2 * h = 64\u03c0h cubic centimeters.\n4. To find the number of large containers needed, divide the total volume of sand from the small containers by the volume of one large container: (192\u03c0h) / (64\u03c0h) = 3.\n5. Sean will need 3 large containers.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We will need to know how much sand Sean has, so we need to find the volumes of each of the two cylindrical containers. If the height of each container is $h$, the old container holds $4^2h\\pi = 16h\\pi$ cubic centimeters of sand. The new container holds $8^2h\\pi = 64h\\pi$ cubic centimeters of sand. We can now find how many new containers Sean will need:  \\begin{align*}\n&12\\text{ old containers}\\cdot \\frac{16h\\pi\\text{ cm}^3}{1\\text{ old container}} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ new container}}{64h\\pi\\text{ cm}^3} \\\\\n&\\qquad = \\boxed{3}\\text{ new containers}.\n\\end{align*}"
