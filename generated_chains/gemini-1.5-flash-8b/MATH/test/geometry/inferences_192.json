        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTheo has one sphere with radius 5; Akshaj has two spheres with radius 2.  What is the ratio of the surface area of Theo's sphere to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres?",
        "inference": "Surface area of a sphere with radius r is 4\u03c0r^2.\nTheo's sphere has radius 5, so its surface area is 4\u03c0(5^2) = 100\u03c0.\nAkshaj's two spheres each have radius 2, so each has surface area 4\u03c0(2^2) = 16\u03c0.\nThe total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 2 * 16\u03c0 = 32\u03c0.\nThe ratio of Theo's sphere's surface area to the total surface area of Akshaj's spheres is 100\u03c0 / 32\u03c0 = 100/32 = 25/8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$.  Thus, Theo's sphere has surface area $4\\pi(5^2)=100\\pi$ and each of Akshaj's spheres have surface area $4\\pi(2^2)=16\\pi$, so Akshaj's spheres together have surface area $16\\pi\\cdot 2 = 32\\pi$.  The desired ratio is hence $\\frac{100\\pi}{32\\pi} = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$."
