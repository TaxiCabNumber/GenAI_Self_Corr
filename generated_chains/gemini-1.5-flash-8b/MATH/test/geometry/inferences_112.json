        "inference": "A pyramid has a base and triangular faces that meet at a common vertex.  The number of edges of a pyramid is the number of sides of the base plus the number of sides of the triangular faces.  If the base has $n$ sides, then there are $n$ edges in the base and $n$ edges connecting the vertices of the base to the apex of the pyramid. Thus, the total number of edges is $n+n = 2n$.  Given the pyramid has $14$ edges, we have $2n=14$, so $n=7$.  The number of vertices of the base is $n=7$. The apex of the pyramid is an additional vertex.
