The third inequality represents the region above the line y = -1/3 x.  We want the intersection of these three regions.\n\nThe circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 \\le 16$.\nThe line $y = x - 4$ intersects the circle when $(x-4)^2 + (x-4)^2 = 16$, which means $2(x-4)^2 = 16$ or $(x-4)^2 = 8$, so $x-4 = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $x = 4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.  The intersection points are $(4 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 4 + 2\\sqrt{2} - 4) = (4 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2})$ and $(4 - 2\\sqrt{2}, 4 - 2\\sqrt{2} - 4) = (4 - 2\\sqrt{2}, -2\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe line $y = -1/3 x$ intersects the circle when $(x-4)^2 + (-x/3)^2 = 16$.  This becomes $x^2 - 8x + 16 + x^2/9 = 16$, which simplifies to $10x^2 - 72x = 0$.  Thus, $x = 0$ or $x = 7.2$.  When $x = 0, y = 0$.  When $x = 7.2, y = -2.4$.\n\nWe need to find the intersection of the three regions. The area of the circle is $16\\pi$.  The area of the triangle formed by the lines $y = x - 4$, $y = -1/3 x$, and $x = 4 + 2\\sqrt{2}$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$.  The intersection of $y = x - 4$ and $y = -x/3$ gives $x - 4 = -x/3$, so $4x/3 = 4$, which means $x = 3$.  So $y = -1$.  The intersection points are (3,-1), (4+2sqrt(2), 2sqrt(2)), and (4-2sqrt(2), -2sqrt(2)).\nThe area of the sector is $\\frac{1}{4} (16 \\pi) = 4 \\pi$.  The area of the triangle formed by the intersection of y = x-4, y = -x/3, and x = 4+2sqrt(2) is\n$1/2 (1 - (-1)) (3-4 - 4) = 1/2 (3 - (-1)) \\times 2 = 1/2 (1)(3-4)= 1$.\n\nThe intersection points are (3,-1), (0,0).  The vertices are (3,-1), (4-2sqrt(2), -2sqrt(2)) and (4+2sqrt(2), 2sqrt(2)).  The area of the sector is $\\frac{2\\pi}{3 \\times 4 \\times 3} \\times 16 \\pi = 4 \\pi / 4 \\approx 3.14$.\nThe area of the sector in the circle is 4 $\\pi / 4 = \\pi$.
