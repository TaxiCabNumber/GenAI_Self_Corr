At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn China, spheres are used to exercise a person's hands. If the diameter of a sphere is 2 inches, how many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
