        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKendra has an unlimited supply of unbreakable sticks of length 2, 4 and 6 inches. Using these sticks, how many non-congruent triangles can she make if each side is made with a whole stick? Two sticks can be joined only at a vertex of the triangle. (A triangle with sides of lengths 4, 6, 6 is an example of one such triangle to be included, whereas a triangle with sides of lengths 2, 2, 4 should not be included.)",

If two sides have length 4, the remaining side could have length $6$ since $6+4>4$ and $4+4>6$.  The remaining side could also have length 2 since $2+4>4$ and $4+4>2$.

        "inference": "The provided solution correctly identifies possible triangles, but it then incorrectly claims that all the listed combinations are non-congruent.  The crucial error is in not considering the order of the sides.
