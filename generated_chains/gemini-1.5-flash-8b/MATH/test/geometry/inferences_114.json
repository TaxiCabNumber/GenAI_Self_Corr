        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch has the same volume as a second right circular cylinder. The radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. How many inches are in the height of the second cylinder?",
        "inference": "Volume of first cylinder = \u03c0 * (radius^2) * height = \u03c0 * (2^2) * 1 = 4\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nVolume of second cylinder = \u03c0 * (radius^2) * height = \u03c0 * (1^2) * height = \u03c0 * height cubic inches.\n\nSince the volumes are equal, 4\u03c0 = \u03c0 * height.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0, we get 4 = height.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal we have $\\pi(2^2)(1)=\\pi(1^2)(h) \\Rightarrow h = \\boxed{4}$ inches."
