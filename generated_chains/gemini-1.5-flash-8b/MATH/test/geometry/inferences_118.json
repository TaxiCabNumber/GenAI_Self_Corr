At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chord of length $6$ units divides a circle into two distinct areas. If the circle has a radius of 6 units, what is the area of the larger region, in square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. The chord of length 6 divides the circle into two segments.\n2. The radius of the circle is 6.\n3. The chord length is 6, which is equal to the radius.\n4. This implies the isosceles triangle formed by the two radii and the chord is equilateral.\n5. The central angle subtended by the chord is 60 degrees.\n6. The area of the sector formed by the 60 degree angle is (60/360) * \u03c0 * 6^2 = (1/6) * 36\u03c0 = 6\u03c0.\n7. The area of the equilateral triangle formed by the two radii and the chord is (1/2) * 6 * 6 * sin(60) = (1/2) * 36 * (\u221a3/2) = 9\u221a3.\n8. The area of the segment is the difference between the sector area and the triangle area: 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3.\n9. The area of the smaller segment is 6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3.\n10. The area of the larger segment is the area of the circle minus the area of the smaller segment: \u03c0 * 6^2 - (6\u03c0 - 9\u221a3) = 36\u03c0 - 6\u03c0 + 9\u221a3 = 30\u03c0 + 9\u221a3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30\\pi+9\\sqrt{3}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Draw radii to the intersection points of the chord with the circle. An equilateral triangle is formed with area $\\frac{6^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 9\\sqrt{3}$. However, the whole section has area $\\frac{36\\pi}{6} = 6\\pi$. If we take the area of the sector away from the area of the entire circle and then add back in the area of the equilateral triangle, we will get the area of the larger region. The area is therefore $36\\pi - 6\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{30\\pi + 9\\sqrt{3}}$."
