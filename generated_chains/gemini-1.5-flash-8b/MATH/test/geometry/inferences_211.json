        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRight $\\Delta ABC$ has legs measuring 8 cm and 15 cm. The triangle is rotated about one of its legs. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the maximum possible volume of the resulting solid? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. **Identify the legs:** The legs of the right triangle are 8 cm and 15 cm.\n2. **Determine the hypotenuse:** Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{64+225} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$ cm.\n3. **Possible rotations:** The triangle can be rotated about either the 8 cm leg or the 15 cm leg.\n4. **Volumes for rotations:**\n   * Rotating about the 8 cm leg: The volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (radius)^2 (height) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (15^2)(8) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (225)(8) = 600\\pi$ cm\u00b3.\n   * Rotating about the 15 cm leg: The volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (radius)^2 (height) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (8^2)(15) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (64)(15) = 320\\pi$ cm\u00b3.\n5. **Maximum volume:** The maximum volume is $600\\pi$ cm\u00b3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{600\\pi}$ cm\u00b3.
