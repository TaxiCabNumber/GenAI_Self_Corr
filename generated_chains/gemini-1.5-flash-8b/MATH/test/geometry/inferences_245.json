At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSally has a cube of side length $s$ units such that the number of square units in the surface area of the cube equals $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the number of cubic units in the volume. She also wants to make a square for which the number of square units in the area of the square is equal to the number of cubic units in the volume of the cube. What should the side length of the square be?",
        "inference": "Surface area of a cube with side length $s$ is $6s^2$.\nVolume of a cube with side length $s$ is $s^3$.\nGiven that the surface area equals $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the volume, we have:\n$6s^2 = \\frac{1}{6}s^3$\nMultiplying both sides by 6, we get\n$36s^2 = s^3$\nDividing both sides by $s^2$, we get\n$36 = s$\nSo the side length of the cube is 36 units.\nThe volume of the cube is $s^3 = 36^3 = 46656$ cubic units.\nWe want the area of a square to equal the volume of the cube, which is $46656$. Let the side length of the square be $x$.\nArea of the square is $x^2 = 46656$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we have $x = \\sqrt{46656} = 216$.\nThus, the side length of the square is 216 units.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{216}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First we know that surface area is 6 times the area of each face, or $6s^2$, and we set this equal to $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the volume. $$6s^2=\\frac{1}{6}s^3\\qquad\\Rightarrow 36s^2=s^3 \\qquad\\Rightarrow s=36$$Now we want a square of side length $a$ and area $a^2$ to have an area equal to the volume of the cube. $$a^2=s^3=36^3=(6^2)^3=6^6\\qquad\\Rightarrow a=\\sqrt{6^6}=6^3=216$$So the side length of the square should be $\\boxed{216}$."
