At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n$\\triangle ABC$ has side lengths 6, 8 and 10, as shown.  Each of the side lengths of $\\triangle ABC$ is increased by $50\\%$, forming a new triangle, $\\triangle DEF$.  What is the area of $\\triangle DEF?$",
        "inference": "1. Since the side lengths of $\\triangle ABC$ are 6, 8, and 10, and each side is increased by 50%, the side lengths of $\\triangle DEF$ are $6(1.5) = 9$, $8(1.5) = 12$, and $10(1.5) = 15$.\n\n2. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of $\\triangle ABC$. The semi-perimeter $s$ is $\\frac{6+8+10}{2} = 12$. The area is $\\sqrt{12(12-6)(12-8)(12-10)} = \\sqrt{12(6)(4)(2)} = \\sqrt{576} = 24$.\n\n3. The side lengths of $\\triangle DEF$ are 9, 12, and 15. The semi-perimeter $s'$ is $\\frac{9+12+15}{2} = \\frac{36}{2} = 18$.\n\n4. The area of $\\triangle DEF$ is $\\sqrt{18(18-9)(18-12)(18-15)} = \\sqrt{18(9)(6)(3)} = \\sqrt{2916} = 54$.\n\n5. The sides of $\\triangle DEF$ are $1.5$ times the sides of $\\triangle ABC$.  The area of $\\triangle DEF$ is $(1.5)^2$ times the area of $\\triangle ABC$.  The area of $\\triangle DEF$ is $(1.5)^2 \\times 24 = 2.25 \\times 24 = 54$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the side lengths of $\\triangle DEF$ are $50\\%$ larger than the side lengths of $\\triangle ABC$, then these new side lengths are $\\frac{3}{2}(6)=9$, $\\frac{3}{2}(8)=12$, and $\\frac{3}{2}(10)=15$.\n\nWe know that $\\triangle DEF$ is right-angled, and this right angle must occur between the sides of length 9 and 12 (since it is opposite the longest side). Therefore, the area of $\\triangle DEF$ is    $$\\frac{1}{2}(9)(12)=\\boxed{54}.$$"
