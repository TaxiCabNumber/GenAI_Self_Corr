To find the center, it suffices to find two perpendicular bisectors (since the third must pass through the intersection of the first two).

These two perpendicular bisectors intersect at $(0,0)$, which is the center of our desired circle.\n\nTo find the radius of our circle, we calculate the distance between the origin and any one of the vertices.
