        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDanny Henry made a waffle on his six-inch-diameter circular griddle using batter containing a half a cup of flour. Using the same batter, and knowing that all waffles have the same thickness, how many cups of flour would Paul Bunyan need for his 24-foot-diameter circular griddle?",
        "inference": "1. Area of Danny's griddle:\n   Area = \u03c0 * (radius)^2 = \u03c0 * (3 inches)^2 = 9\u03c0 square inches\n\n2. Area of Paul Bunyan's griddle:\n   Radius = 24 feet / 2 = 12 feet = 12 * 12 inches = 144 inches\n   Area = \u03c0 * (144 inches)^2 = 20736\u03c0 square inches\n\n3. Ratio of areas:\n   Ratio = (20736\u03c0 square inches) / (9\u03c0 square inches) = 2304\n\n4. Cups of flour needed for Paul Bunyan's griddle:\n   Cups = (2304) * (0.5 cups) = 1152 cups\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1152}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Say Paul and Danny's griddles have diameters $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively. Paul's griddle has $\\frac{d_1}{d_2}=\\frac{24\\text{ ft}}{.5\\text{ ft}}=48$ times the diameter and therefore $\\frac{\\pi d_1^2/4}{\\pi d_2^2/4}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=48^2=2304$ times the area. It requires $2304$ times as much flour, or $2304\\cdot0.5=\\boxed{1152}$ cups of flour."

        "inference": "The problem is likely about scaling.  The ratio of the areas doesn't directly translate to the amount of flour needed.  We need the amount of flour *per unit area*.\n\nLet's assume the amount of flour needed for Danny's griddle is given by the area.  The problem doesn't provide a rate, so let's assume that the ratio of flour to area is constant for both griddles.\n\nArea of Danny's griddle = 9\u03c0 square inches\nArea of Paul Bunyan's griddle = 20736\u03c0 square inches\n\nRatio of areas = 20736\u03c0 / 9\u03c0 = 2304\n\nSince the ratio of the areas is 2304, we need 2304 times the amount of flour for Paul Bunyan's griddle as compared to Danny's.\n\nIf Danny needs 0.5 cups of flour, then Paul Bunyan needs 2304 * 0.5 cups = 1152 cups.\n\n$\\boxed{1152}$\n",
