Let a line segment have endpoints (x,0) and (0,y) where $x+y=2$ and $0 \\le x,y \\le 2$. The midpoint of this segment is $(\\frac{x}{2}, \\frac{y}{2})$. Since $x+y=2$, $\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{2} = 1$. Thus, the midpoints are on the line $y = 2-x$ or $x+y = 2$. This line has slope -1. The endpoints of the line segments must be on adjacent sides, and the line segments must have length 2.  This means $x^2 + y^2 = 2^2 = 4$.  If the endpoint on the x-axis is $(x,0)$, the other endpoint must be on the y-axis and must have the form $(0,2-x)$. The length of the segment is $\\sqrt{x^2 + (2-x)^2} = 2$, which simplifies to $x^2 + 4 - 4x + x^2 = 4$, giving $2x^2 - 4x = 0$ or $2x(x-2) = 0$. Thus, $x = 0$ or $x = 2$.
