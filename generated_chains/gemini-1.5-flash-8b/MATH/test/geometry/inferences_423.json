        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nP.J. has a cylindrical mug with a 3-inch diameter. His mug is filled to a height of 6 inches with grape juice. Schuyler has a cylindrical mug with a 4-inch diameter. To what height in inches must Schuyler's mug be filled so that he receives the same amount of juice as P.J.? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "1. P.J.'s mug has a diameter of 3 inches, so its radius is 1.5 inches.  The volume of P.J.'s mug is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.  P.J.'s volume is \u03c0(1.5\u00b2) * 6 = 13.5\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\n2. Schuyler's mug has a diameter of 4 inches, so its radius is 2 inches.  Let 'h' be the height (in inches) Schuyler's mug must be filled to.  Schuyler's volume is \u03c0(2\u00b2) * h = 4\u03c0h cubic inches.\n\n3. To have the same amount of juice, we set P.J.'s volume equal to Schuyler's volume: 13.5\u03c0 = 4\u03c0h.\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 to get 13.5 = 4h.\n\n5. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for h: h = 13.5 / 4 = 3.375.\n\n6. Converting 3.375 to a mixed number: 3.375 = 3 + 0.375 = 3 + 3/8 = 3 3/8.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3\\frac{3}{8}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "P.J.'s juice fills up a cylinder with radius 3/2 inches and height 6 inches; his juice has volume $\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2(6)= \\frac{27\\pi}{2}$ cubic inches.\n\nSchuyler's juice fills up a cylinder with radius 2 inches and unknown height $h$ inches; his juice has volume $\\pi (2^2) (h) = 4\\pi h$ cubic inches.  Setting this equal to P.J.'s volume and solving for $h$ yields $\\frac{27\\pi}{2} = 4\\pi h \\Rightarrow h = \\frac{27}{8}= \\boxed{3 \\frac{3}{8}}$ inches."
