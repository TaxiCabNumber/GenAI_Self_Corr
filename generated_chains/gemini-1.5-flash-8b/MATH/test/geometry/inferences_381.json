        "inference": "The crucial error is assuming $P$ is the intersection of $AC$ and $MN$.  The problem statement should be interpreted as asking for the area of $\\triangle APC$.  We are given that $P$ lies on the line $AC$ and on the line through $M$ and $N$.  Since $M$ and $N$ are midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$ respectively, $MN$ is parallel to $AC$. The line segment $MN$ intersects the line segment $AC$ at a point. We are given $A = (0, 6)$, $B = (0, 0)$, and $C = (8, 0)$. $M=(0,3)$, $N=(4,0)$. The equation for $AC$ is $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 6$. The equation for $MN$ is $y = -\\frac{3}{4} x + 3$. The problem states that $P$ is on $MN$, so $P$ lies on the line $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3$. But we're given $P$ is on $AC$, meaning $P$ is a point on the intersection of $AC$ and $MN$.  If $P$ lies on $AC$, then the y-coordinate of $P$ is given by $y_p = -\\frac{3}{4} x_p + 6$. If $P$ lies on $MN$, then the y-coordinate of $P$ is given by $y_p = -\\frac{3}{4} x_p + 3$. Since $P$ lies on both lines, we can set them equal: $-\\frac{3}{4}x_p + 6 = -\\frac{3}{4}x_p + 3$. This is a contradiction and thus the intersection of $MN$ and $AC$ is not defined. The problem intends that $P$ is a point on $AC$. The correct equation for the line segment $AC$ is $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 6$. Since $P$ is on the line segment $AC$, the x-coordinate of $P$ must be between 0 and 8. This means $P$ has to be the intersection of $MN$ and $AC$, which means we need $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 6 = -\\frac{3}{4}x + 3$. Therefore, $P = (\\frac{8}{3}, 2)$. The area of triangle $APC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$",
