At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has sides measuring 1 unit and 3 units. The length of the third side is an integer value of units. What is the length of the third side, in units?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let the sides be a=1, b=3, and c be the third side.  Then:\n\n1 + 3 > c  =>  4 > c\n1 + c > 3  =>  c > 2\n3 + c > 1  =>  c > -2 (This is always true since c is a length)\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have 2 < c < 4.  The only integer value for c that satisfies this is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the length of the third side $n$. By the triangle inequality, $1+3>n$ and $1+n>3$, or $2<n<4$. The only integer $n$ which satisfies this is $\\boxed{3}$."
