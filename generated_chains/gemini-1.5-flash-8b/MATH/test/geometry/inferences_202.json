        "inference": "The given information implies that triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs AB=15 and AC=24.  We know DE is parallel to BC, and DE = (1/2) BC. Also F is the midpoint of BC.  This means DEF is a right triangle.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, BC = \u221a(15\u00b2 + 24\u00b2) = \u221a801.\nSince DE is half the length of BC, DE = \u221a801/2.\nSince F is the midpoint of BC,  BF = FC = BC/2 = \u221a801/2.\n\nSince DE || BC, triangle DEF is similar to triangle ABC.  Also, EF = AB/2 = 15/2 and DF = AC/2 = 24/2 = 12.  The key missing step is realizing that DEF is a right triangle with hypotenuse DF.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle DEF.\nEF\u00b2 + DE\u00b2 = DF\u00b2\n(15/2)\u00b2 + (\u221a801/2)\u00b2 = 12\u00b2\n225/4 + 801/4 = 144\n1026/4 = 144  This is incorrect.  The error was in step 7 and 8.\n\nSince DE is half of BC and parallel to BC, triangle DEF is similar to triangle ABC with a scale factor of 1/2.\nSince triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs 15 and 24, DE = 1/2 BC = 1/2 sqrt(15^2 + 24^2) = sqrt(225+576)/2 = sqrt(801)/2.  This is incorrect also, but it's not where the major error is.\n\n\nEF = AB/2 = 15/2\nDF = AC/2 = 12\n\nThe area of triangle DEF is (1/2) * EF * DF = (1/2) * (15/2) * 12 = 45.\n\nThe crucial piece is that triangle DEF is a right triangle since DE||BC. Since the triangle ABC is a right triangle, we use properties of similar triangles.\n\n$\\boxed{45}$\n",
