At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe surface area of a particular cube is 600 square inches. When the edges of the cube are doubled in length, what is the volume of the new cube, in cubic inches?",
        "inference": "1. Surface area of a cube is given by $6s^2$, where s is the length of an edge.\n2. We are given that the surface area of the original cube is 600 square inches.\n3. $6s^2 = 600$\n4. $s^2 = 100$\n5. $s = 10$ inches (since length must be positive)\n6. The original cube has edges of length 10 inches.\n7. When the edges are doubled, the new length of an edge is $2 \\times 10 = 20$ inches.\n8. The volume of a cube is given by $s^3$.\n9. The volume of the new cube is $20^3 = 8000$ cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8000}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the original side length, in inches. We originally have $6s^2 = 600,$ so $s=10.$ Doubling $s,$ the volume becomes $20^3=\\boxed{8000}$ cubic inches."
