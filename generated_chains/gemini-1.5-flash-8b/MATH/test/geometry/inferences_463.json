How many centimeters away is point X from the midpoint M of the diagonal AC?

        "inference": "1. By the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle ABC, we have $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$.\n2. Since ABCD is a rectangle, $AB = CD = 6$ and $BC = AD$.\n3. Given $AC = 10$, we have $6^2 + BC^2 = 10^2$, so $36 + BC^2 = 100$, and $BC^2 = 64$.\n4. Thus, $BC = 8$.\n5. The area of rectangle ABCD is $AB \\times BC = 6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n6. Also, the area of triangle ABC is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 8 = 24$.\n7. Since BX is perpendicular to AC, the area of triangle ABC can also be calculated as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times AC \\times BX$, so $24 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times BX$.\n8. This gives $BX = \\frac{2 \\times 24}{10} = \\frac{48}{10} = 4.8$.\n9. The midpoint M of AC has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{0+25}{2}, \\frac{0+15}{2}\\right) = (12.5, 7.5)$.\n10. The coordinates of X are found using the area formula, but the problem statement gives BX = 4.8.\n11. The distance between X and M is along a perpendicular to AC, since M is the midpoint. \n12. Using the distance formula between X and M (with BX as the perpendicular to AC, so X is vertically above or below M), we can find the distance as the perpendicular component.\n13.  From similar triangles, $\\frac{BX}{AM} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$, $\\frac{BX}{BM-AM} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$, etc.\n14.  Since M is the midpoint of AC, AM = MC = 5.\n15.  The coordinates of X are (x, y). The distance between X and M is a vertical distance given by |y - 7.5|.\n16. Since $BX = 4.8$, we can conclude that the distance from X to M is just $BX \\sin (\\theta) = 4.8\\sin (\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between AC and BX.  Since X is on AC, AM = MC, the distance from X to M is the difference in the y-coordinates. However, that doesn't use BX, so we will use the area formulas.\n17. The distance from X to M is $\\frac{1}{2}|15 - 0| / \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\times15\\times\\sqrt{2} = 5.2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.4}$",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $\\triangle ABX \\sim \\triangle ACB$ since $\\angle BXA = \\angle ABC$ and $\\angle A$ is shared by both triangles. From this similarity, we have the equation $\\frac{AB}{AC}=\\frac{AX}{AB}$. Plugging in the known values of the sides and solving for $AX$, we have $\\frac{6}{10}=\\frac{AX}{6}\\Rightarrow AX=3.6$. Since $AM=10/2=5$, $XM=5-3.6=\\boxed{1.4}$ centimeters."
