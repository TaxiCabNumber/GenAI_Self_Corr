At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe volume of a cube is 0.027 cubic meters. What is its surface area in square meters?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the cube. Then $s^3$ is the volume, so $s^3 = .027$. Taking the cube root of both sides gives $s = .3$. The area of one face of the cube is thus $s^2 = .09$. There are six faces, so the surface area is $6(.09) = \\boxed{0.54}$ square meters."
