        "inference": "The problem states the center of the circle is $C(3,1)$ and the radius is the distance from the center to a point on the circle, such as $(8,1)$.  However, this is not enough information to find the area of the entire circle. We need the *radius*. The given point (8,1) is *on* the circle. The distance from the center (3,1) to (8,1) gives the radius, which is 5. The area of the circle with radius 5 is $A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (5^2) = 25\\pi$.\n\n$\\boxed{25\\pi}$\n",
