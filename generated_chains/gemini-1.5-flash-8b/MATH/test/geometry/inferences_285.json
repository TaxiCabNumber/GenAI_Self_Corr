The area of the triangle is maximized when the third vertex is on the circle such that the altitude from that vertex to the diameter is maximal.\nThe maximum altitude occurs when the third vertex is the point on the circle that is farthest from the diameter AB, which means the vertex C is 90 degrees from A and B.
