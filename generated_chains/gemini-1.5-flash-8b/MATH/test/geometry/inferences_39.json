At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circular sheet of paper of radius 6 inches is cut into 3 equal sectors, and each sector is formed into a cone with no overlap. What is the height in inches of the cone?",
        "inference": "The circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the arc length of the sector.  The circumference of the original circle is $2\\pi(6) = 12\\pi$ inches.  Since the circle is cut into 3 equal sectors, the arc length of each sector is $\\frac{12\\pi}{3} = 4\\pi$ inches.  This is also the circumference of the base of each cone.\n\nLet $r$ be the radius of the base of the cone. Then $2\\pi r = 4\\pi$, so $r=2$ inches.\nThe radius of the original circle is 6 inches.  The slant height of the cone is the radius of the original circle, which is 6 inches.  Let $h$ be the height of the cone. By the Pythagorean theorem, $r^2 + h^2 = 6^2$, so $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$.  This simplifies to $4 + h^2 = 36$, and $h^2 = 32$.  Therefore $h = \\sqrt{32} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$ inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "A circular sheet of paper with radius 6 inches has a circumference of $2\\pi r = 2 \\pi (6) = 12\\pi$ inches. Since this sheet of paper is cut into 3 equal sectors, each sector must have an arc length of $1/3$ that of the original circle, so each sector has an arc length of $4\\pi$ inches. Because of the way that a cone is formed, the original radius of the circle now becomes the slant height of the cone and the arc length becomes the perimeter of the cone's base. If we let the radius of the cone base be $R$, then we know that the circumference $4\\pi$ must equal $2\\pi R$, so $2 \\pi R = 4 \\pi$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2\\pi$, we get that the radius of the cone base is $2$ inches.\n\nWe then notice that the radius of the base, the altitude of the cone, and the slant height of the cone form a right triangle where the slant height is the hypotenuse. Since we know both the radius and the slant height, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height $h$ of the cone. We have that $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$, so $h^2=32$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $h=\\sqrt{32}=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}$ inches."
