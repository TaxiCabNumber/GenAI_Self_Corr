        "inference": "An octagonal prism has two octagonal bases and eight rectangular lateral faces.\nEach octagonal base has 8 edges.\nThe two octagonal bases have 2 * 8 = 16 edges.\nThe eight rectangular lateral faces have 8 * 4 = 32 edges (each rectangle has 4 edges, not 2).  \nHowever, since each pair of adjacent lateral faces share an edge, we count these edges only once.  The 8 octagonal bases have 8 edges each, giving 2(8) = 16 edges.  The 8 lateral faces have 8(4) = 32 edges.  But some edges are counted twice (adjacent faces share edges).  To correct, we have 16+ (8 x 4)/2 = 16 + 16=32\nSince there are 8 lateral faces, there are 8 edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two octagonal bases.\nTherefore, the total number of edges is 16 + 8 = 24\n\nThe octagonal bases each have 8 edges, so the two bases have 2 * 8 = 16 edges. Each lateral face is a rectangle with 4 edges. The eight lateral faces contribute 8 * 4 = 32 edges. However, we counted each shared edge twice, so we must subtract the number of shared edges from 32. There are 8 shared edges. Thus, the total number of edges is 16 + (32 - 8) = 16 + 24 = 40\n\nEach lateral face has 4 edges. Since there are 8 lateral faces, there are 8 * 4 = 32 edges in the lateral faces. Each octagonal base has 8 edges. The two octagonal bases have 2 * 8 = 16 edges. \nTherefore, the total number of edges in the prism is 16 + 32/2 *2 = 16 + 32 = 48/2 = 24, but we must subtract the edges between faces of the prism. Each lateral face shares an edge with two other lateral faces, giving us 8 edges in between lateral faces. These are also counted twice, so 32 - 8 = 24. Thus, 16 + 24 = 40 total edges.\n\nCorrect Approach:\n\nEach octagon has 8 edges.  Two octagons have 2 * 8 = 16 edges.\nEach rectangular face has 4 edges.  There are 8 rectangular faces, so 8 * 4 = 32 edges.\nHowever, each edge shared by adjacent lateral faces is counted twice, so we must subtract the number of shared edges. Since the prism has 8 rectangular sides, there are 8 edges shared between adjacent rectangular faces. So the total number of unique edges is 16 + 32 - 8 = 40\n\n$\\boxed{24}$\n",
