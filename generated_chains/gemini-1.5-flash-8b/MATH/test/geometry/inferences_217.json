At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlana is making a ball out of rubber bands.  When the ball has 54 rubber bands, it has a diameter of 3 cm.  How many rubber bands should Alana add to the ball to increase its diameter by 1 cm?  Assume that all of Alana's rubber bands have the same volume.",
        "inference": "1. The number of rubber bands is proportional to the surface area of the sphere.\n2. The surface area of a sphere with diameter d is given by 4\u03c0(d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0d\u00b2.\n3. The ratio of the surface areas of two spheres with diameters d\u2081 and d\u2082 is (\u03c0d\u2081\u00b2)/(\u03c0d\u2082\u00b2) = (d\u2081\u00b2/d\u2082\u00b2).\n4. The ratio of the number of rubber bands for spheres with diameters 3 cm and 4 cm is (3\u00b2/4\u00b2) = 9/16.\n5. Let x be the number of rubber bands needed to increase the diameter from 3 cm to 4 cm.  Then 54(9/16) = x\n6. 54 * (9/16) = 30.375\n7. Since the number of rubber bands must be an integer, we round to the nearest integer. 30.375 rounds up to 31.\n8. So, Alana needs to add 31 rubber bands to increase the diameter by 1 cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{31}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the volume of a sphere is directly proportional to its diameter cubed, the ratio of the volume of the ball with a diameter of 4 cm to the volume of the ball with a diameter of 3 cm is $(4/3)^3\n= 64/27$.  Since all of the rubber bands have the same volume, it follows that the number of rubber bands in the ball with diameter 4 is \\[ (4/3)^3 \\cdot 54 = \\frac{64}{27} \\cdot 54 = 64 \\cdot 2 = 128. \\]Therefore the number of rubber bands that Alana needs to add to the ball is $128 - 54 = \\boxed{74}$."
