At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(2,5)$ and $B(10,5)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter $AB$.\nThe midpoint formula is given by $M = \\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nIn this case, $A(2,5)$ and $B(10,5)$, so the midpoint is\n$M = \\left(\\frac{2+10}{2}, \\frac{5+5}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{12}{2}, \\frac{10}{2}\\right) = (6,5)$.\nThe radius of the circle is half the length of the diameter.\nThe length of the diameter $AB$ is $|10-2| = 8$.\nThe radius is $r = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\nThe area of the circle is given by $A = \\pi r^2$.\nIn this case, $A = \\pi (4^2) = 16\\pi$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We could use the distance formula, but since $A$ and $B$ have the same $y$-coordinate, we can see that the distance between them is $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of 8, the radius must have length 4. Therefore, the answer is $4^2\\pi = \\boxed{16\\pi}$."
