At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nElliott Farms has a silo for storage. The silo is a right circular cylinder topped by a right circular cone, both having the same radius. The height of the cone is half the height of the cylinder. The diameter of the base of the silo is 10 meters and the height of the entire silo is 27 meters. What is the volume, in cubic meters, of the silo? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,18)--(5,27)--(10,18)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,-1)..(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,1)..(10,0),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,17)..(10,18),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,19)..(10,18),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((15,27)--(16,27),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,0)--(16,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,27)--(15.5,16),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,11),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"27 meters\",(15.5,13.5));\n\n[/asy]",

        "inference": "The solution incorrectly calculates the height of the cone.  If the height of the silo is 27 meters and the cone part is half the height of the cylinder, then the height of the cylinder is indeed 13.5 meters.  However, the height of the cone is *not* 13.5 / 2 = 6.75 meters.  The height of the cone is 27/2 - 13.5, which is 13.5 meters.  \n\nSince the cone and cylinder are parts of a single shape, they share the same radius of 5 meters.   The height of the cone is 27/2 = 13.5.\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, and the volume of a cone is (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nCylinder volume: V<sub>cylinder</sub> = \u03c0(5\u00b2)(13.5) = 337.5\u03c0 m\u00b3\n\nCone volume:  V<sub>cone</sub> = (1/3)\u03c0(5\u00b2)(13.5) = 112.5\u03c0 m\u00b3\n\nTotal volume: V<sub>total</sub> = 337.5\u03c0 + 112.5\u03c0 = 450\u03c0 m\u00b3\n\n$\\boxed{450\\pi}$\n",
