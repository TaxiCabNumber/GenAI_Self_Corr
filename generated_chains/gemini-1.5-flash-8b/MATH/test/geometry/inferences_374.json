At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ with vertices at $A(1, 1)$, $B(1, -2)$ and $C(5, -2)$ is translated up 3 units and then dilated with respect to the origin by a factor of 2. What are the new coordinates of point $C$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

Dilate $C'(5, 1)$ by a factor of 2 with respect to the origin.  Multiply both the x and y coordinates by 2.  $5 \\times 2 = 10$ and $1 \\times 2 = 2$. The dilated point is $C''(10, 2)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(10, 2)}$\n",
