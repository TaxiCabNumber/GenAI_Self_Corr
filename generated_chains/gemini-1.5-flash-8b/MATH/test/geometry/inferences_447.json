I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a nondegenerate triangle measure 2'' and 4'' and the third side measures some whole number of inches. If a cube with faces numbered 1 through 6 is rolled, what is the probability, expressed as a common fraction, that the number showing on top could be the number of inches in the length of the third side of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let the sides of the triangle be a, b, and c.\nThe triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Thus, we have the following inequalities:\na + b > c\na + c > b\nb + c > a\nWe are given a = 2 and b = 4.  Substituting these values into the inequalities:\n2 + 4 > c  =>  6 > c\n2 + c > 4  =>  c > 2\n4 + c > 2  =>  c > -2 (this is always true)\n\nThus, 2 < c < 6.\nThe possible whole number values for c are 3, 4, and 5.\nThere are 3 possible values for the third side.\nThe cube has faces numbered 1 through 6.  The total number of possible outcomes is 6.\nThe possible lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5.  These are 3 of the possible outcomes.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\nProbability = 3/6 = 1/2\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
