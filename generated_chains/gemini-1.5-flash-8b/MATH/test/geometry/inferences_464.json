At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a triangle have lengths of 18 and 29 units. If the third side has an integer length, what is the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let the sides be 18, 29, and x.  Then:\n\n1) 18 + 29 > x  =>  47 > x\n2) 18 + x > 29  =>  x > 11\n3) 29 + x > 18  =>  x > -11 (This is always true since x is a length)\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have 11 < x < 47.  Since x is an integer, the possible values for x are 12, 13, ..., 46.  The maximum value is 46 and the minimum value is 12.\nThe difference is 46 - 12 = 34.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the third side have a length of $x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, $29<x+18$ and $x<18+29$.  Solving these two inequalities, we find $11<x<47$.  Therefore, the maximum and minimum integral values of $x$ are $46$ and $12$, respectively.  The difference between these two values is $46-12=\\boxed{34}$."
