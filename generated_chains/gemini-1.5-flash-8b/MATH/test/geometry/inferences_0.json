        "inference": "Let the triangle be ABC.\nWe are given that $\\cos B = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$.

The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.  \nFor angle C, the side opposite to angle C has length 8, and the adjacent side to angle C has length 6.\nTherefore, $\\tan C = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$",
