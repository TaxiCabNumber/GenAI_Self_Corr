        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the sides of a triangle are 7, 24 and 25. What is the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "1. **Check for a right triangle:**  Using the Pythagorean theorem, 7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = 49 + 576 = 625 = 25\u00b2.  Since 7\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 = 25\u00b2, this is a right triangle.\n\n2. **Find the area:** The area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  In this case, the base and height are the two legs (7 and 24).\n\n3. Area = (1/2) * 7 * 24 = 84.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We notice that $7^2+24^2=49+576=625$. Since $7^2+24^2=25^2$, the side lengths 7, 24, and 25 are the side lengths of a right triangle with legs 7 and 24 units, and hypotenuse 25 units. Thus, we can find the area of the triangle by multiplying $1/2$ by the product of lengths of the bases to get $(1/2)(7)(24)=7\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{84}$ square units."
