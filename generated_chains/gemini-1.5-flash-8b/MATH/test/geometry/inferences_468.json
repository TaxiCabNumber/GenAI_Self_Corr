At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the mean of the measures of the three exterior angles of a triangle if two of the interior angles have measures of 63 and 78 degrees?",

C = 180 - (63 + 78) = 180 - 141 = 39 degrees.\n4. The exterior angle at each vertex is supplementary to the interior angle at that vertex.\n5. Exterior angle at vertex A = 180 - 63 = 117 degrees.\n6. Exterior angle at vertex B = 180 - 78 = 102 degrees.\n7. Exterior angle at vertex C = 180 - 39 = 141 degrees.\n8. The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.\n9. Mean of the exterior angles = (117 + 102 + 141)/3 = 360/3 = 120 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
