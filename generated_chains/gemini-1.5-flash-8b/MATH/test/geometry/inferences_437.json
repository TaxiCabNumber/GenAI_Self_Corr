        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of cubic inches in the volume of a 6-inch high cylindrical can equals the number of square inches in the area of the label that covers the lateral surface of the can. In inches, what is the radius of the can?",
        "inference": "1. Let the radius of the cylindrical can be 'r' inches and the height be 6 inches.\n2. The volume of the cylinder is given by V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0r\u00b2(6) = 6\u03c0r\u00b2 cubic inches.\n3. The lateral surface area of the cylinder is given by A = 2\u03c0rh = 2\u03c0r(6) = 12\u03c0r square inches.\n4. We are given that the volume equals the area, so 6\u03c0r\u00b2 = 12\u03c0r.\n5. Divide both sides by 6\u03c0r to get r = 2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the number of inches in the radius of the can.  The volume of the can is $\\pi r^2(\\text{height})=6\\pi r^2$ cubic inches.  The lateral surface area is $2\\pi r (\\text{height})=12\\pi r$ square inches.  Setting $6\\pi r^2$ equal to $12\\pi r$, we find  \\begin{align*}\n6\\pi r^2-12\\pi r&=0 \\implies \\\\\n6\\pi r( r-2 )&=0 \\implies \\\\\nr=0 \\quad &\\text{or}\\quad r=2.\n\\end{align*} Taking the positive solution $r=2$, we find that the radius of the can is $\\boxed{2}$ inches."
