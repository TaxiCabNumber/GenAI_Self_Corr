At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of a triangle are each $8$ units long. If the third side has a whole number length, what is the greatest possible perimeter, in units, for the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let the sides of the triangle be $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a = 8$, $b = 8$.\nBy the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n$a + b > c \\Rightarrow 8 + 8 > c \\Rightarrow 16 > c$.\n$a + c > b \\Rightarrow 8 + c > 8 \\Rightarrow c > 0$.\n$b + c > a \\Rightarrow 8 + c > 8 \\Rightarrow c > 0$.\nSo, $0 < c < 16$.\nSince $c$ is a whole number, the possible values for $c$ are $1, 2, 3, ..., 15$.\nThe maximum value of $c$ is $15$.\nThe perimeter is $a + b + c = 8 + 8 + 15 = 31$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{31}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The Triangle Inequality says that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. That means $8+8=16$ must be greater than the length of the third side. The third side has a whole number length, so the greatest possible length is 15 units. That makes the perimeter $8+8+15=\\boxed{31}$ units."
