At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe acute angles of a particular isosceles trapezoid each measure 40 degrees. What is the measure, in degrees, of each obtuse angle in the trapezoid?",
        "inference": "1. An isosceles trapezoid has two pairs of parallel sides and two pairs of congruent base angles.\n2. The acute angles are 40 degrees each.\n3. The sum of angles on the same side of a transversal is 180 degrees.\n4. Since the two acute angles are on the same side of a transversal, the obtuse angles must also be supplementary to the acute angles.\n5. The obtuse angles are 180 - 40 = 140 degrees each.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{140}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In an isosceles trapezoid, there are two pairs of congruent angles.  Let $x$ and $y$ be the distinct angle measures.  Since the angles of a quadrilateral sum to 360, we have $2x+2y=360$.  Setting $x=40$ we find $y=\\boxed{140}$ degrees."
