At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of two interior angles of a parallelogram is $4:5$. What is the degree measure of one of the two obtuse angles of the parallelogram?",
        "inference": "Let the two interior angles of the parallelogram be $4x$ and $5x$.\nSince the angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, we have\n$4x + 5x = 180$\n$9x = 180$\n$x = 20$\nThe two angles are $4x = 4(20) = 80$ degrees and $5x = 5(20) = 100$ degrees.\nSince the opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, the two angles are 80 degrees and 100 degrees.\nThe sum of the interior angles in a parallelogram is 360 degrees.\nThe two obtuse angles in a parallelogram are equal. Thus the two obtuse angles are 100 degrees each.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the measures of these two interior angles are $x$ and $y$, then $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{4}{5}$ and therefore $5x=4y$. We also know that $x+y=180$, so therefore $4x+4y=720$, $9x=720$, and $x=80$. Therefore, $y = \\frac{5}{4} \\times 80 = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$."
