        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA hemispherical cup of radius 3 inches is filled with milk. The milk is then poured into a right cylindrical container of radius 2 inches. What is the minimum number of inches in the height of the container so it can hold all of the milk? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "1. Volume of a hemisphere: The volume of a hemisphere with radius r is (1/2)(4/3)\u03c0r^3 = (2/3)\u03c0r^3.\n2. Volume of the milk: The volume of milk in the hemispherical cup is (2/3)\u03c0(3^3) = (2/3)\u03c0(27) = 18\u03c0 cubic inches.\n3. Volume of a cylinder: The volume of a right cylinder with radius r and height h is \u03c0r^2h.\n4. Height of the cylinder: We want to find the minimum height h such that the volume of the cylinder is greater than or equal to the volume of the milk. So, \u03c0(2^2)h \u2265 18\u03c0.\n5. Solving for h: 4\u03c0h \u2265 18\u03c0,  which simplifies to h \u2265 18/4 = 4.5 inches.\n6. Minimum height: The minimum height of the cylindrical container is 4.5 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4.5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The hemisphere-shaped milk cup has volume \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3^3) = 2\\cdot 3^2\\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic inches.  A cylindrical container with height $h$ has volume \\[\\pi(2^2)(h)=4\\pi h\\] cubic inches.  The milk will fit if \\[4\\pi h \\ge 18\\pi.\\]   Dividing both sides of the inequality by $4\\pi$ gives \\[h\\ge 4.5,\\]  so the minimum height is $\\boxed{4.5}$ inches."
