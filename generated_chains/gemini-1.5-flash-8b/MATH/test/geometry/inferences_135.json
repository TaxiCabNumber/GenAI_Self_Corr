        "ground_truth": "By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are consecutive integers, we can write $a = b-1$ and $c = b + 1$.

Factoring, we have $b(b-4) = 0$, so $b=0$ or $b=4$. If $b=0$, then $a = b-1 = -1$, which can't happen since $a$ is a length.

        "inference": "The side length of the outer square is 7. The side length of the inner square is $c$.  \nThe side length of the inner square is given by $7 - 2a = 7 - 2b = 7 - 2c = c$.

The vertices of the inner square lie on the sides of the outer square. The distance from one side to the next is $a, b, c$.  $a, b, c$ are consecutive integers.  We have $a+b+c = s$, where $s = 7-2a = 7-2b = 7-2c = c$.  Thus $s = 7-2(s-1) = 7 - 2(s-2) = 7-2(s-3) = s$.  \nThis gives $s = 7-2s$, so $3s = 7$.  This has no integer solution.\nTry $a=1, b=2, c=3$. The side length of the inner square is $s = a+b = 1+2=3$. $s = 7-2(3-2) = 7-2 = 5$. $a+b = 3$.\nConsider $a, b, c$ as consecutive integers.  The length of one side of the inner square is $a+b = 5$.
