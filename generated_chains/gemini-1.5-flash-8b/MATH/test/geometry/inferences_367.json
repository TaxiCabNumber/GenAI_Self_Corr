        "inference": "The given triangle $ABC$ has sides $AB = 8$, $BC = 15$, and $AC = 17$.\nThe Law of Cosines states that $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A$.\nWe have $17^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 - 2(8)(15)\\cos(\\angle ABC)$, which simplifies to $289 = 64 + 225 - 240\\cos(\\angle ABC)$.\nThis leads to $240\\cos(\\angle ABC) = 0$, so $\\cos(\\angle ABC) = 0$.\nThis means $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$, and the triangle is a right triangle.\nSince $O$ is the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle $ABC$, the diameter of the circle is the hypotenuse $AC$.\nTherefore, the diameter of the circle is 17.\nThe radius is half the diameter, which is $\\frac{17}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$",
