        "inference": "Let the radius of the semicircle be $r$.\nThe area of the semicircle is given by $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi r^2 = 2\\pi$.\nSolving for $r$, we have $r^2 = 4$, so $r = 2$.\nThe semicircle is tangent to sides $AC$ and $BC$ of the right isosceles triangle $ABC$. Since the center of the semicircle is on the hypotenuse $AB$, and the center of the semicircle is equidistant from the two legs $AC$ and $BC$, the center of the semicircle is the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nIn a right isosceles triangle, the angle bisectors meet at the incenter, which is at a distance $r$ from each side. Thus the legs of the right isosceles triangle $ABC$ are $2(2) + 2(2) = 8$.\nLet the length of each leg be $x$. Then $x^2 + x^2 = (2r + 2r)^2 = (4r)^2$.\n$2x^2 = (8)^2 = 64$\n$x^2 = 32$\n$x = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe length of each leg of $\\triangle ABC$ is $2r+2r = 4r = 8$.\nThe area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} (8)(8) = 32$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32}$",
