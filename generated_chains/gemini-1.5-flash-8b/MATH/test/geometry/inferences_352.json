At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMinneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is 8 miles southwest of downtown St. Paul and 10 miles southeast of downtown Minneapolis. To the nearest integer, how many miles apart are   downtown St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis?",
        "inference": "1. Let S be downtown St. Paul and M be downtown Minneapolis.\n2. The airport (A) is 8 miles southwest of S and 10 miles southeast of M.\n3. This forms a triangle with vertices S, A, and M.\n4. SA = 8, AM = 10\n5. We have a right triangle with SA and AM as legs and SM as the hypotenuse.\n6. By the Pythagorean theorem, SM\u00b2 = SA\u00b2 + AM\u00b2\n7. SM\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 = 64 + 100 = 164\n8. SM = \u221a164 \u2248 12.806248474\n9.

        "ground_truth": "Let downtown St. Paul, downtown Minneapolis, and the airport be located at $S$, $M$, and $A$, respectively. Then $\\triangle MAS$ has a right angle at $A$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, \\[\nMS= \\sqrt{10^{2}+8^{2}}= \\sqrt{164}\\approx 12.8.\n\\] Therefore, the distance between the two downtowns to the nearest mile is  $\\boxed{\\text{13}}$ miles."
