        "inference": "Let $A=(0,0)$, $B=(4,0)$, $C=(4,-4)$, and $D=(0,-4)$. Since triangle $ABE$ is equilateral, with $AB=4$, the coordinates of $E$ are $(2, -2\\sqrt{3})$.

Then $y = -2(3-\\sqrt{3}) = -6+2\\sqrt{3}$. So $P = (2(3-\\sqrt{3}), -6+2\\sqrt{3})$.\nSince $BC$ is horizontal, a perpendicular line segment to $BC$ from $P$ has the same $x$-coordinate as $P$. The intersection point $Q$ of $BC$ and the perpendicular from $P$ is $Q=(2(3-\\sqrt{3}), -4)$. The length of $PQ$ is $|-6+2\\sqrt{3} - (-4)| = |-2+2\\sqrt{3}| = 2\\sqrt{3} - 2 = 2(\\sqrt{3}-1)$.\nThe problem asks for the distance from $P$ to $BC$. The distance from $P$ to $BC$ is the vertical distance between the $y$-coordinate of $P$ and the $y$-coordinate of $C$ (or $D$, or $B$), which is $|-6+2\\sqrt{3} - (-4)| = |-2+2\\sqrt{3}| = 2\\sqrt{3}-2$.\n\nThe perpendicular distance from $P$ to $BC$ is the length of $PQ$.
