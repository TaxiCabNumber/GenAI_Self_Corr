        "inference": "1. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.\n2. We are given that the area of the triangle is $16\\sqrt{3}$ square centimeters.\n3. Setting the area formula equal to the given area: $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 = 16\\sqrt{3}$.\n4. Solving for $s$: $s^2 = \\frac{4 \\times 16\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = 64$.\n5. Taking the square root of both sides, $s = 8$ centimeters.\n6. Since the perimeter of the square and the triangle are equal, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s = 3(8) = 24$ centimeters.\n7. Let the side length of the square be $x$. The perimeter of the square is $4x$, so $4x = 24$, which means $x = 6$ centimeters.\n8. The diagonal of a square with side length $x$ is given by $x\\sqrt{2}$.\n9. Thus, the diagonal of the square is $6\\sqrt{2}$ centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters. I hope it is correct.\n",
