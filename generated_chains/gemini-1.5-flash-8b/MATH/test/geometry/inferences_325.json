        "inference": "The volume of the sphere is given as $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$.  Using the formula for the volume of a sphere, $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = V$, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$.

Since the sphere is inscribed in a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.  Therefore, the side length of the cube is 1.
