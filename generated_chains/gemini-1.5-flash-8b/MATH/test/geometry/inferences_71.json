        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square base.  Each edge of the pyramid is 4 inches long.  The side length of the square base, $s$, is not necessarily equal to 4.  However, since each edge of the pyramid is 4 inches long, the pyramid has a square base and four equilateral triangular faces.  Thus $s=4$.  The height of each equilateral triangle (slant height) is 4.  The height of the pyramid is not given.  We need to find the height of the pyramid ($h_p$).\nLet $l$ be the slant height.\nBy Pythagorean theorem, $l^2 = h^2 + (\\frac{s}{2})^2 = 4^2 + (2)^2 = 16+4=20$.\n$l=\\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nNow, consider a triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the side length of the base, and the slant height.  This is a right triangle.  Let $h_p$ be the height of the pyramid.  Then\n$h_p^2 + (\\frac{s}{2})^2 = l^2$\n$h_p^2 + (2)^2 = (2\\sqrt{5})^2$\n$h_p^2 + 4 = 20$\n$h_p^2 = 16$\n$h_p = 4$\nThe area of the base is $s^2 = 4^2 = 16$.\nThe volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{area of base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 16 \\times 4 = \\frac{64}{3} = 21.3333...$\nRounded to the nearest hundredth, the volume is 21.33 cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21.33}$",
