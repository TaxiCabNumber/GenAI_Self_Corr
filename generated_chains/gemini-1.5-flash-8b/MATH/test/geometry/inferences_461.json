At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sides of a triangle with positive area have lengths 4, 6, and $x$. The sides of a second triangle with positive area have lengths 4, 6, and $y$. What is the smallest positive number that is $\\textbf{not}$ a possible value of $|x-y|$?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality, for a triangle with sides $a, b, c$ to exist, we must have $a+b > c$, $a+c > b$, and $b+c > a$.\n\nFor the first triangle with sides 4, 6, and $x$, we have:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $4+6 > x \\Rightarrow 10 > x$\n    \\item $4+x > 6 \\Rightarrow x > 2$\n    \\item $6+x > 4 \\Rightarrow x > -2$\n\\end{enumerate}\nCombining these inequalities, we get $2 < x < 10$.\n\nFor the second triangle with sides 4, 6, and $y$, we have:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $4+6 > y \\Rightarrow 10 > y$\n    \\item $4+y > 6 \\Rightarrow y > 2$\n    \\item $6+y > 4 \\Rightarrow y > -2$\n\\end{enumerate}\nCombining these inequalities, we get $2 < y < 10$.\n\nThe possible values of $|x-y|$ must satisfy\n$$|x-y| \\ge |2-10| = 8$$\nAlso, $|x-y| \\le |10-2| = 8$\nSo we have $0 \\le |x-y| \\le 8$, and $|x-y|$ can be any integer from 0 to 8.\nThe triangle inequality for the difference of the two sides gives us:\n$$|x-y| < 4+6 = 10$$\n$$|x-y| > |10-10| = 0$$\nFrom $2<x<10$ and $2<y<10$, we have $|x-y| \\ge 0$ and $|x-y| \\le 8$.\nThe possible values of $|x-y|$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.\n\nThe smallest possible positive number that is not a possible value of $|x-y|$ is 9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$",
        "ground_truth": "By the Triangle Inequality, each of $x$ and $y$ can be any number strictly between 2 and 10, so $0\\le |x-y|<8$. Therefore, the smallest positive number that is not a possible value of $|x-y|$ is $10-2=\\boxed{8}$."
