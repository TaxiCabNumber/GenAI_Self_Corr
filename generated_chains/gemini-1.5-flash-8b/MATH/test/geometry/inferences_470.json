        "inference": "1. If the wire is 72 cm long and cut into two equal pieces, each piece has a length of 72 cm / 2 = 36 cm.\n2. The length of the wire is the circumference of the circle.  Circumference (C) = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius.\n3. For each circle, 36 = 2\u03c0r.  Solving for r:  r = 36 / (2\u03c0) = 18/\u03c0 cm.\n4. The area of a circle (A) is \u03c0r\u00b2.\n5. For each circle, Area = \u03c0 * (18/\u03c0)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (324/\u03c0\u00b2) = 324/\u03c0.\n6. The sum of the areas of the two circles is 2 * (324/\u03c0) = 648/\u03c0.\n7. Approximating \u03c0 as 3.14159, the sum is approximately 648 / 3.14159 = 206.084 cm\u00b2\n8.  Calculating the sum more accurately: 648/\u03c0 \u2248 205.73052.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{206}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since the $72$ cm wire is cut into two equal pieces, each piece must have a length of $36$ cm. This means that the circumference of each of the circles is $36$ cm. Next, we find the radius of one of these circles. The circumference of a circle is equal to $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Setting this expression equal to $36$, we have that $2 \\pi r = 36$, so $r = 18/\\pi$ cm.\n\nSince the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$, we know that the area of each of these circles is $\\pi \\cdot \\left(\\frac{18}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{324}{\\pi}$.
