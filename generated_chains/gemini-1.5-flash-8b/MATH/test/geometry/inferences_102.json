        "inference": "Let the sides of the isosceles triangle be $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since it's isosceles, two sides have the same length, say $a=b$. The perimeter is $a+b+c = 20$.\nThus, $2a+c=20$, which means $c=20-2a$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are whole numbers, $a$ and $c$ must be positive integers.\nAlso, by the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\nThis gives us three inequalities:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $a+a > c \\implies 2a > 20-2a \\implies 4a > 20 \\implies a > 5$\n    \\item $a+c > a \\implies a+20-2a > a \\implies 20-a > a \\implies 20 > 2a \\implies a < 10$\n    \\item $a+c > b \\implies a+(20-2a) > a \\implies 20-a > a \\implies 20 > 2a \\implies a < 10$\n\\end{enumerate}\nCombining these inequalities, we have $5 < a < 10$. Since $a$ is an integer, possible values for $a$ are $6, 7, 8, 9$.\nFor $a=6$, $c = 20-2(6) = 8$.\nFor $a=7$, $c = 20-2(7) = 6$.\nFor $a=8$, $c = 20-2(8) = 4$.\nFor $a=9$, $c = 20-2(9) = 2$.\nThe possible triangles are (6, 6, 8), (7, 7, 6), (8, 8, 4), and (9, 9, 2).\nAll these triangles satisfy the triangle inequality.\nThus, there are 4 such triangles.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ denote the measure of each of the two equal sides.  Then the remaining side has measure $20-2x$ units.  By the triangle inequality, the third side must be shorter than the two equal sides combined.  In other words, $x+x>20-2x$.  Solving this inequality, we find $x>5$.  Also, the third side length has to be positive, so $20-2x>0$ which implies $x<10$.  Therefore, the $\\boxed{4}$ integers strictly between 5 and 10 are the possible integer values of $x$."

        "inference": "Let the sides of the isosceles triangle be $a$, $a$, and $c$. The perimeter is $2a+c = 20$.  Thus $c = 20-2a$.  Since $a$ and $c$ are positive integers, $a$ must be less than 10.  By the triangle inequality, we need $a+a > c$, which means $2a > 20-2a$, or $4a > 20$, so $a > 5$. Also, $a+c > a$, which is always true, and $a+c > a$, which is always true. The condition we need is $a+c > a$, or $20-2a+a > a$.  This gives $20-a > a$, which implies $20 > 2a$, so $a < 10$.\nCombining the inequalities, we have $5 < a < 10$.
