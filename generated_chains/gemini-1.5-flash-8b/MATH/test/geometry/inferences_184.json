        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sides of the base of a triangular pyramid are 3, 4 and 5 feet and the altitude is 6 feet. What is the number of cubic feet in the volume of the pyramid?",
        "inference": "The base is a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5.  Area of the base = (1/2) * 3 * 4 = 6 sq ft.\nVolume of a pyramid = (1/3) * Area of base * height\nVolume = (1/3) * 6 sq ft * 6 ft = 12 cubic ft.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because we have $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, the base of the pyramid is a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4.  Therefore, the area of the base is $3\\cdot 4/2 = 6$ square feet.  The altitude of the pyramid is 6 feet.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $6\\cdot 6/3=\\boxed{12}$ cubic feet."
