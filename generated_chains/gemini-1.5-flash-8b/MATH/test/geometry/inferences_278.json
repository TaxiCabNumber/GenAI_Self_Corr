        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe circumference of the interior of a cylindrical water glass is $3\\pi$ inches, and its interior height is 4 inches. How many cubic inches of liquid can the glass hold? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The circumference of the interior of the cylindrical water glass is $3\\pi$ inches.\nThe formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius.\n$3\\pi = 2\\pi r$\n$r = \\frac{3\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{2}$ inches.\nThe interior height is 4 inches.\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height.\n$V = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 (4) = \\pi \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\right)(4) = \\pi(9) = 9\\pi$ cubic inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9\\pi}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the glass have base radius $r$ inches, so $3\\pi = 2\\pi r \\Rightarrow r = 3/2$.  It follows that the glass has volume (and can hold) $\\pi (3/2)^2(4) = \\boxed{9\\pi}$ cubic inches of liquid."
