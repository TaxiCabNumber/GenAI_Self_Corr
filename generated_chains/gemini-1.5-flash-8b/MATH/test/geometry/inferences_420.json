At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe side lengths of a right triangle measure $x$, $x + y$ and $x - y$ units where $0 < y < x$. What is the value of $y \\div x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "By the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n$$x^2 + (x-y)^2 = (x+y)^2$$\n$$x^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$$\n$$2x^2 - 2xy = x^2 + 2xy$$\n$$x^2 = 4xy$$\nSince $x \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $x$:\n$$x = 4y$$\nNow we solve for $y \\div x$:\n$$y \\div x = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{y}{4y} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Clearly $x+y$ is the largest of $x, x+y,x-y$, and this value is thus the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.  By the Pythagorean theorem, we see that $x^2 + \\left(x-y\\right)^2 = \\left(x+y\\right)^2$.  Dividing through by $x^2$, we find that $1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2$.\n\nRearranging and factoring a difference of squares, we obtain $1 = 2 \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}\\right)$.  Thus we see that $y \\div x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
