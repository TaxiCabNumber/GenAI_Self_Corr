At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(0, 0)$, $B(6, 0)$, $C(6, 10)$ and $D(0, 10)$ are vertices of rectangle $ABCD$, and $E$ is on segment $CD$ at $(2, 10)$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ADE$ to the area of quadrilateral $ABCE$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
