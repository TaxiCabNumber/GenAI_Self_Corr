I hope it is correct.'\nA company makes a six-sided hollow aluminum container in the shape of a rectangular prism as shown. The container is $10^{''}$ by $10^{''}$ by $12^{''}$. Aluminum costs $\\$0.05$ per square inch. What is the cost, in dollars, of the aluminum used to make one container?\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ndraw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)--(0,0,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((1,0,0)--(1,0,-1)--(1,1,-1)--(1,1,0)--(1,0,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((0,1,0)--(1,1,0)--(1,1,-1)--(0,1,-1)--(0,1,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"$12^{''}$\",(1,0,-.5),W);\n\nlabel(\"$10^{''}$\",(.5,0,0),N);\n\nlabel(\"$10^{''}$\",(0,.5,0),N);\n\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "1. The container is a rectangular prism with dimensions 10 inches by 10 inches by 12 inches.\n2. The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by the formula 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height respectively.\n3. In this case, l = 10, w = 10, and h = 12.\n4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n   Surface Area = 2((10)(10) + (10)(12) + (10)(12))\n   Surface Area = 2(100 + 120 + 120)\n   Surface Area = 2(340)\n   Surface Area = 680 square inches\n5. The cost of the aluminum is $0.05 per square inch.\n6. Multiplying the surface area by the cost per square inch, we get:\n   Total Cost = (680 square inches) * ($0.05/square inch)\n   Total Cost = $34.00\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$34.00}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The amount of aluminum used is equal to the surface area of the container. The horizontal faces have area $10\\cdot10=100$ square inches. The vertical faces have area $12\\cdot10=120$ square inches. Thus, the total surface area is $2\\cdot100+4\\cdot120=680$ square inches.
