        "inference": "The given points are A(-1, -1) and B(5, -5). The distance formula correctly finds the length of AB.  However, the problem statement implies that A, B, and another point C form an isosceles right triangle with AB as one leg.  This means the legs of the triangle are equal in length.

Without knowing the coordinates of C, it is impossible to determine the area.\n\nThe provided solution assumes a specific configuration, which is likely incorrect without a diagram.  More information about the triangle's configuration (e.g., coordinates of C, or additional relationships among the points) is required.\n\n\nWithout more information, the problem cannot be solved.\n$\\boxed{Cannot be determined}$\n",
