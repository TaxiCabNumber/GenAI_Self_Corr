At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe points $A(2,5), B(6,5), C(5,2)$ and $D(1,2)$ are the vertices of a parallelogram. If the parallelogram is translated down 2 units and right three units, what will be the coordinates of the final image of point $B$?",

The coordinates of point B are (6,5).\n\n3. Applying the translation:\n   x-coordinate: 6 + 3 = 9\n   y-coordinate: 5 - 2 = 3\n\n4. The final coordinates of point B are (9,3).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(9,3)}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When an image is translated to the right we just add the number of units it is being translated to the original $x$-coordinate. When an image is translated down we just subtract that number of units from the $y$-coordinate. In this case we'll subtract 2 from the $y$-coordinates and add 3 to the   $x$-coordinates. This will make point $B(6, 5)$ move to $B'(6 + 3, 5 - 2) = \\boxed{(9, 3)}$."
