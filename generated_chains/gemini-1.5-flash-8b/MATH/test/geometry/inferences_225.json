At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square units, of an isosceles trapezoid with bases of 7 and 17 units and legs of 13 units?",
        "inference": "1. Draw the isosceles trapezoid. Drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base. This creates two right triangles and a rectangle in the middle.\n2. The bases of the trapezoid are 7 and 17. The difference between the bases is 17 - 7 = 10.\n3. The two right triangles have legs of length 10 / 2 = 5. The hypotenuse is 13.\n4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the height of the trapezoid is \u221a(13\u00b2 - 5\u00b2) = \u221a(169 - 25) = \u221a144 = 12.\n5. The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula: (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height = (1/2) * (7 + 17) * 12 = (1/2) * 24 * 12 = 12 * 12 = 144.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{144}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base of the trapezoid to the other base.  This divides the trapezoid into a rectangle and two congruent right triangles.  Each of the right triangles has hypotenuse 13 units long and side length $(17-7)/2=5$ units long.  Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is $\\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$ units.  The area of the $12\\times 7$ rectangle is 84 square units, and the collective area of the two triangles is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 12=60$ square units.  The area of the trapezoid is $84+60=\\boxed{144}$ square units."
