The three small semicircles overlap.  We need to find the area of the shaded portion. This is more complicated.  To find the correct answer, we need a diagram.  Assuming the three small semicircles are tangent to each other and to the large semicircle, and the shaded area is enclosed between the three small semicircles and the large semicircle, the problem is not straightforward. We need the diagram.  Without the diagram, the problem cannot be solved.\n$\\boxed{No solution possible}$\n",
