At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne cube has a volume of 343 cubic centimeters. The edge length of a second cube is three times the edge length of this first cube. What is the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube, in cubic centimeters?",
        "inference": "1. Find the edge length of the first cube:\n   The volume of a cube is side^3.  So, if the volume is 343 cm^3, then the side length is the cube root of 343, which is 7 cm.\n\n2. Find the edge length of the second cube:\n   The second cube has an edge length three times that of the first, so its edge length is 7 cm * 3 = 21 cm.\n\n3. Find the volume of the second cube:\n   The volume of the second cube is (21 cm)^3 = 9261 cm^3.\n\n4. Find the difference in volume:\n   The difference is 9261 cm^3 - 343 cm^3 = 8918 cm^3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8918}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "By homothety, the second cube has a volume that is $3^3 = 27$ times that of the first.  Hence the difference in the cubes' volumes is $27\\cdot 343 - 343 = \\boxed{8918}$ cubic centimeters."
