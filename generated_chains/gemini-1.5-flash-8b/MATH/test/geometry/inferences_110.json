I hope it is correct.'\nThe point at $(a, b)$ on a Cartesian plane is reflected over the  $y$-axis to the point at $(j, k)$. If $a + j = 0$ and $b + k = 0$, what is the value of $b$?",

Also, $a + j = 0$ implies $a + (-a) = 0$, which is always true.  Since $b + k = 0$, we have $b + (-b) = 0$, which is always true as well.\n\nGiven $j = -a$, we have $a + j = a + (-a) = 0$, which is consistent.\nSince $b + k = 0$, and $k = -b$, then $b + (-b) = 0$, which is consistent.\nThe reflection changes $a$ to $-a$, and $b$ to $b$. The given conditions just confirm this is the reflection over the y-axis.\nSince the reflection over the y-axis doesn't change the y-coordinate, we have $k=b$.
