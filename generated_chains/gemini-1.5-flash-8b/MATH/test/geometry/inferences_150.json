        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has leg lengths of 7 and 24 units. A second triangle is similar to the first triangle and has a hypotenuse of 100 units. What is the length, in units, of the shorter leg of the second triangle?",
        "inference": "The first triangle has legs of length 7 and 24.  Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse of the first triangle is sqrt(7^2 + 24^2) = sqrt(49 + 576) = sqrt(625) = 25.\n\nThe two triangles are similar, so the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.  Let the shorter leg of the second triangle be 'x'.  The ratio of the shorter legs is 7/x, and the ratio of the hypotenuses is 25/100 = 1/4.\n\nSince 7/x = 1/4, we have x = 7 * 4 = 28.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "$7^2+24^2=625=25^2$, so the hypotenuse is $25$. $100$ is $4$ times this, so the shorter leg of the second triangle is $4$ times the shorter leg of the original triangle, or $4(7)=\\boxed{28}$."
