        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn antacid tablet is in the shape of a right circular cylinder. The diameter of the base is $\\frac{3}{4}$ inches and the tablet is $\\frac{3}{16}$ inches thick. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the tablet? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The diameter of the base is $\\frac{3}{4}$ inches, so the radius is $\\frac{3}{8}$ inches.\nThe height (thickness) of the tablet is $\\frac{3}{16}$ inches.\nThe volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have\n$V = \\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right) = \\pi \\left(\\frac{9}{64}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right) = \\pi\\left(\\frac{27}{1024}\\right)$ cubic inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{27\\pi}{1024}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the base is half the diameter or $3/8$ inches.  We plug in the given values to determine the volume of the tablet: $\\pi r^2 h = \\pi (3/8)^2 (3/16) = \\boxed{\\frac{27\\pi}{1024}}$ cubic inches."
