        "inference": "Let $\\angle ABC = \\angle BAC = 40^{\\circ}$. Since the sum of the angles in $\\triangle ABC$ is $180^{\\circ}$, we have $\\angle ACB + 40^{\\circ} + 40^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$.

By the Exterior Angle Theorem, the exterior angle at $B$ is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles, which are $\\angle ACB$ and $\\angle CAB$.
