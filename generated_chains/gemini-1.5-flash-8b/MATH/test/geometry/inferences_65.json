At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A(2,2)$ and $B(7,7)$ be points in the plane. Define $R$ as the region in the first quadrant consisting of those points $C$ such that $\\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle. What is the area of the region $R$?",

The total area of the region in the first quadrant bounded by $y = x$ and $y = -x+9$ is the area of a triangle with vertices (0,0), (4.5,0) and (0,4.5), but is restricted to the upper right triangle.\n   The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 4.5 = \\frac{20.25}{2} = 10.125$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10.125}$",
