At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pyramid has 6 vertices and 6 faces. How many edges does it have?",
        "inference": "Let V be the number of vertices, F be the number of faces, and E be the number of edges in a polyhedron.\nEuler's formula for polyhedra states that V - E + F = 2.\nIn this case, V = 6 and F = 6.\nSubstituting these values into Euler's formula, we get:\n6 - E + 6 = 2\n12 - E = 2\nE = 12 - 2\nE = 10\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "A pyramid with $6$ faces would have a pentagon on the bottom and five triangles on the sides. There are thus $5$ edges on the bottom along the pentagon and an additional $5$ edges from the triangles on the sides, for a total of $5+5 = \\boxed{10\\;\\text{edges}}$."
