        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bottled-water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold $30 \\pi$ cubic inches of water?",
        "inference": "The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$, where $V$ is the volume, $r$ is the radius, and $h$ is the height.\nGiven that the radius $r = 3$ inches and the volume $V = 30\\pi$ cubic inches, we need to find the height $h$.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$30\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3^2) h$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$30\\pi = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (9) h$\n$30\\pi = 3\\pi h$\n\nDivide both sides by $3\\pi$:\n$h = \\frac{30\\pi}{3\\pi}$\n$h = 10$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h = 30 \\pi,\\] so $h = \\boxed{10}$."
