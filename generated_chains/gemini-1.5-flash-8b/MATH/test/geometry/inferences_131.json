        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo right circular cylinders have equal volume. The first cylinder has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 12 inches. What is the number of inches in the height of the second cylinder if its radius is 8 inches? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nThe volume of the first cylinder is V\u2081 = \u03c0(6\u00b2)(12) = \u03c0(36)(12) = 432\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nThe second cylinder has the same volume, so V\u2082 = 432\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nThe volume of the second cylinder is V\u2082 = \u03c0(8\u00b2)(h\u2082) = \u03c0(64)(h\u2082).\n\nSince V\u2081 = V\u2082, we have 432\u03c0 = 64\u03c0h\u2082.\n\nDividing both sides by \u03c0, we get 432 = 64h\u2082.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 64 to solve for h\u2082:\nh\u2082 = 432/64 = 6.75\n\nThus, h\u2082 = 6 3/4 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6\\frac{3}{4}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the second cylinder have height $h$ inches.  Setting the two volumes equal, we have \\[\\pi (6^2)(12) = \\pi (8^2) h.\\]   Solving yields $h = \\frac{27}{4} = \\boxed{6 \\frac{3}{4}}$ inches."
