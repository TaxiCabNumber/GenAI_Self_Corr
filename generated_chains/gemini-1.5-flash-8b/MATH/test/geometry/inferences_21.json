At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of scalene $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ measure $3$ centimeters and $5$ centimeters. How many different whole centimeter lengths are possible for the third side?",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  Let the sides of the triangle be $a=3$, $b=5$, and $c$ (the unknown side).\n\nCase 1: $a+b > c$\n$3+5 > c$\n$8 > c$\nCase 2: $a+c > b$\n$3+c > 5$\n$c > 2$\nCase 3: $b+c > a$\n$5+c > 3$\n$c > -2$  (This is always true since $c$ is a length)\n\nCombining the inequalities, we have $2 < c < 8$.

        "ground_truth": "Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side of a triangle with sides $3\\text{ cm}$ and $5\\text{ cm}$ must be larger than $2\\text{ cm}$ but smaller than $8\\text{ cm}.$ If the third side must be a whole centimeter length, and the triangle is scalene, that means that the only possible lengths for the third side are: $4\\text{ cm},$ $6\\text{ cm},$ and $7\\text{ cm}.$ That makes $\\boxed{3}$ possible lengths for the third side."
