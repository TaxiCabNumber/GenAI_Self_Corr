At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the integers $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\\dots,$ $16$ is written on a separate slip of paper and these slips are placed in a pile. Jillian will randomly draw slips from the pile without replacement and will continue drawing until two of the numbers she has drawn from the pile have a product that is a perfect square. What is the maximum number of slips that Jillian can draw without obtaining a product that is a perfect square?",
