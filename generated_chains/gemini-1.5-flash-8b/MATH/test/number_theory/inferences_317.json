        "inference": "To find the number of positive cubes that divide $2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1$, we need to find the number of cubes dividing the number.  A cube is of the form $n^3$.  Thus the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of the cube must be multiples of 3.  We can take the exponents of the prime factors and divide them by 3.  The largest integer values that are less than or equal to 8/3, 4/3, 2/3, and 1/3 are 2, 1, 0, 0 respectively.  This means that the exponents in the cube factors must be 0, 3, 6, or 9 for the factor of 2, 0, 3, or 6 for the factor of 3, 0 or 3 for the factor of 5, and 0 for the factor of 7.  The maximum powers of 2, 3, 5, 7 that can be cubes are $2^6, 3^3, 5^0, 7^0$. Thus, for 2, we have 3 possibilities (0, 3, 6). For 3, we have 2 possibilities (0, 3). For 5, we have 1 possibility (0). For 7, we have 1 possibility (0).  The number of possible cubes that divide $2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^1$ is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor. The number of choices is $(3)(2)(1)(1) = 6$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$",
