At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexa has a mixture consisting of 8 ounces of red jelly beans and 13 ounces of green jelly beans. What is the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans she must buy so that, when added to the old mixture, her new mixture is an integer number of pounds?",
        "inference": "1 pound = 16 ounces.\nThe current mixture weighs 8 + 13 = 21 ounces.\nTo get an integer number of pounds, the total weight must be a multiple of 16 ounces.\nThe next multiple of 16 after 21 is 32.\nSo we need 32 - 21 = 11 more ounces of white jelly beans.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 8+13=21 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the minimum number of ounces Alexa must add to have an integer number of pounds is $2\\cdot16-21=32-21=\\boxed{11}$."
