Multiples of 4 are divisible by 4, so we check the numbers:\n\n    * 1232 / 4 = 308, so 1232 is a multiple of 4.\n    * 1243 / 4 = 310.75, not a multiple of 4.\n    * 1324 / 4 = 331, so 1324 is a multiple of 4.\n    * 1342 / 4 = 335.5, not a multiple of 4.\n    * 1423 / 4 = 355.75, not a multiple of 4.\n    * 1432 / 4 = 358, so 1432 is a multiple of 4.\n    * ... and so on.\n\n4.
