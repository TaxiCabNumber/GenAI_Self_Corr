At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers?",

        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=\\boxed{10}$."

        "inference": "The problem states that the product of three consecutive integers is 720.  Let the integers be n-1, n, and n+1.  Their product is (n-1)n(n+1) = 720.  Expanding this gives n(n^2 - 1) = 720, or n^3 - n = 720.  Then n^3 - n - 720 = 0.\n\nTrying integer values of n, we find that n = 9 works:  9^3 - 9 = 729 - 9 = 720.  So n = 9.
