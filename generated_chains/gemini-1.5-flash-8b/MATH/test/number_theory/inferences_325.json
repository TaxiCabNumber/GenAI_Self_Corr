At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDonut Haven fries donuts in batches of $20$, but sells them in boxes of $13$.\n\nIf Donut Haven fries just enough batches of $20$ to pack $44$ full boxes of $13$ donuts, how many donuts will be left over?",
        "inference": "1. Total donuts in 44 boxes of 13 donuts each: $44 \\times 13 = 572$ donuts.\n2. Number of batches of 20 donuts needed to make 572 donuts: $\\frac{572}{20} = 28.6$.\n3. Since we can't have a fraction of a batch, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means Donut Haven needs to fry 29 batches.\n4. Total donuts from 29 batches: $29 \\times 20 = 580$ donuts.\n5. Leftover donuts: $580 - 572 = 8$ donuts.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem using modular arithmetic. Donut Haven needs to fry at least $44\\cdot 13$ donuts. Working modulo $20$, we have \\begin{align*}\n44\\cdot 13 &\\equiv 4\\cdot 13 \\\\\n&= 52 \\\\\n&\\equiv 12\\qquad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of donuts in $44$ full boxes is $12$ more than a multiple of $20$, which means it's $8$ less than the next multiple of $20$. Donut Haven will have $\\boxed{8}$ donuts left over."
