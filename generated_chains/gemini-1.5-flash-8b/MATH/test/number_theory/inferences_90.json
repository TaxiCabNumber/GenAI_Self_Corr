        "inference": "The first few positive perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, ...\n\nThe units digits of these cubes are 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 0, ...\nThe pattern of the units digits repeats every 4 terms: 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 0, 1, 8, 7, 4, ...\n\nWe need to find the units digit of the sum of the first 21 perfect cubes.\nThe units digits are 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 0, 1, 8, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 0, 1, ...\nThe units digits repeat in a cycle of length 4.\nTo find the units digit of the sum of the first 21 cubes, we consider the sum of the units digits for the first 4 cubes:\n1 + 8 + 7 + 4 = 20, so the units digit is 0.\nWe want the units digit of the sum of the first 21 terms.\n21 / 4 = 5 with a remainder of 1.\nThe first 20 perfect cubes will have the same units digit as the sum of the first 20 terms.

        "ground_truth": "Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 19, n \\neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\\boxed{1}$."
