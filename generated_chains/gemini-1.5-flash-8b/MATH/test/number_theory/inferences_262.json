        "ground_truth": "First, for simplicity, let's make all the amounts of money into integers by considering them all in cents. For example, $\\$5.43$ becomes 543. Let the purchase price be $A=A_1A_2A_3$ and the amount of change be $B_1B_2B_3$ where $A_1$ represents the first digit of $A$, $B_1$ represents the first digit of $B$, $A_2$ represents the second digit of $A$, etc.\n\nWe know that $A+B=1000$, and we can conclude that $A_1+B_1=9$ because if $A_1+B_1<9$ then $A+B<1000$ and if $A_1+B_1=10$ then $A_2=B_2=A_3=B_3=0$, but then the only way that B can be a rearrangement of the digits of A is if $A_1=B_1=5$, which means $A=B=500$, but the problem states that the price and the amount of change are different.\n\nSince 9 is odd, we can also conclude that $A_1$ and $B_1$ are distinct, which, using the fact that $A$'s digits can be rearranged to get B's digits, implies that $A_1=B_2$ or $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_2$ or $B_1=A_3$. We can also observe that A and B have the same remainder when divided by 9 because the remainder when $n$ is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of the digits of $n$ is divided by 9 for all $n$ and the sum of the digits of A is obviously equal to the sum of the digits of B.\n\nSince the remainder when 1000 is divided by 9 is 1, we can in fact conclude that the remainder when A and B are divided by 9 (and when the sum of their digits is divided by 9) is 5. Keeping in mind that two of the digits of $A$ are $A_1$ and $B_1$ and that $A_1+B_1=9$, we can conclude that the other digit is 5, which is the only digit that would result in the sum having a remainder of 5 when divided by 9. By similar logic we can conclude that 5 is also one of the digits of $B$. A little thought makes it clear that at least one of these 5's appears as the last digit in its number (that is, $A_3=5$ or $B_3=5$) since if neither of them appears as the last digit in a number, then $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_3$ and $A_3+B_3=9\\Rightarrow A+B$ ends in a 9, which is a contradiction. But if $A_3=5$ then the only way for the sum of $A$ and $B$ to end in a 0 is for $B_3=5$, so we can conclude that $A_3=B_3=5$, $A_1=B_2$, and $A_2=B_1$. So once we have picked a value for $A_1$, the other 5 digits are all determined. Since both amounts are greater than a dollar, we know that $A_1$ can be any number between 1 and 8 for a total of 8 possible prices (and thus 8 possible amounts of change). To double check, we can work out $A$ and $B$ for each value of $A_1$ and reconvert them to dollars to make sure that the price and the amount of change satisfy the given conditions:\n\n$A_1=1\\Rightarrow A=\\$1.85, B=\\$8.15$;\n\n$A_1=2\\Rightarrow A=\\$2.75, B=\\$7.25$;\n\n$A_1=3\\Rightarrow A=\\$3.65, B=\\$6.35$;\n\n$A_1=4\\Rightarrow A=\\$4.55, B=\\$5.45$;\n\n$A_1=5\\Rightarrow A=\\$5.45, B=\\$4.55$;\n\n$A_1=6\\Rightarrow A=\\$6.35, B=\\$3.65$;\n\n$A_1=7\\Rightarrow A=\\$7.25, B=\\$2.75$; and finally\n\n$A_1=8\\Rightarrow A=\\$8.15, B=\\$1.85$.\n\nThis confirms that there are $\\boxed{8}$ possible amounts of change."
