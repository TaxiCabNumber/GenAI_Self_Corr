        "inference": "We are given that $28n$ is divisible by $365$. This means that $28n = 365k$ for some positive integer $k$. We want to find the least positive integer value of $n$.\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ such that $28n$ is a multiple of $365$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest $n$ such that $\\frac{28n}{365}$ is an integer.\nWe can rewrite the condition as $n = \\frac{365k}{28}$ for some positive integer $k$.\nTo find the smallest positive integer $n$, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{365k}{28}$ is an integer.

        "ground_truth": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot7$ and $365=5\\cdot73$, $(28,365)=1$. Therefore, $28n$ is divisible by 365 if and only if $n$ is divisible by both 5 and 73. Thus, the least value of $n$ is $5\\cdot73=\\boxed{365}$."
