At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 64 is both a perfect cube and a perfect square, since $4^3 = 64$ and $8^2 = 64$. What is the next larger number that is both a perfect cube and a perfect square?",
        "inference": "To find the next larger number that is both a perfect cube and a perfect square, we need to find a number that can be expressed as $n^3$ and $m^2$ for some integers $n$ and $m$.  This means the number must be of the form $n^3 = m^2$.  We can write this as $n^3 = (k^3)^2 = k^6$ for some integer $k$.  Thus, we need to find the next perfect sixth power after $2^6 = 64$.\n$3^6 = 729$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{729}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power. $2^6=64$ and the next such number is $3^6=\\boxed{729}$."
