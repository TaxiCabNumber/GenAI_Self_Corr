        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of the product of all of the odd integers between 0 and 12?",
        "inference": "The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\nThe product of these integers is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395.\nThe units digit of 10395 is 5.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. Thus, $N=1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9\\times11= 5(1\\times3\\times7\\times9\\times11)$. The product of odd integers is odd, and the units digit of 5 times any odd number is $5$. Therefore,  the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
