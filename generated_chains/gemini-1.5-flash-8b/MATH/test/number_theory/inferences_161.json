I hope it is correct.'\nA Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
        "inference": "Let $P_0$ be the initial number of Penteria.\nAfter 1 minute, the population increases by 5, so there are $P_0 + 5$ Penteria.\nAfter 2 minutes, the population increases by 5 again, so there are $P_0 + 2 \\times 5$ Penteria.\nAfter $m$ minutes, the population increases by $5m$, so there are $P_0 + 5m$ Penteria.\nAt the end of each hour, all but the initial ones die.\nIn the first hour (0 to 59 minutes), the population is $P_0 + 5m$ for $m=0,1,\\dots,59$.\nSo after 59 minutes, there are $P_0 + 5 \\times 59 = P_0 + 295$ Penteria.\nAt the end of the hour, only $P_0$ are left.\nAfter 1 hour (60 minutes), there are $P_0$ Penteria.\nAfter 2 hours, the population is $P_0$.\nIn the second hour (60 to 119 minutes), there are $P_0 + 5m$ for $m=0,1,\\dots,59$.\nAfter 119 minutes, there are $P_0 + 5 \\times 59 = P_0 + 295$ Penteria.\nAt the end of the 2nd hour, only $P_0$ are left.\nAfter 506 minutes, the number of hours is $\\lfloor\\frac{506}{60}\\rfloor = 8$. The number of minutes remaining is $506 - 8 \\times 60 = 506 - 480 = 26$ minutes.\nThe population after 26 minutes in the 8th hour is $P_0 + 5(26) = P_0 + 130$.\nThe population is $P_0$ at the end of every hour.\nAfter the 8th hour, there are $P_0 + 5 \\times 26 = P_0 + 130$ Penteria.\nThe total number of minutes is 26 minutes into the 8th hour.\n$P_0 + 5 \\times 26 = P_0 + 130$.\nAt the end of the 8th hour, only $P_0$ are left.\nSo the number of Penteria after 506 minutes is $P_0 + 130$.\nWe are given that 137 Penteria are alive after 506 minutes, so $P_0 + 130 = 137$.\n$P_0 = 137 - 130 = 7$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$",
        "ground_truth": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$."
