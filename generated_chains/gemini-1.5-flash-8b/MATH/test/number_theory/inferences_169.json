After selling the cows, they divided the money by giving $\\$10$ to the older brother, $\\$10$ to the younger brother, $\\$10$ to the older, $\\$10$ to the younger, and so on. At the last division of money, the older brother received $\\$10$, but the younger brother received less than $\\$10$. How many dollars must the younger brother have received at the last division?",

The total amount is $nx = x = 10$, so $x=10$.\n\nIf $n = 2k+1$, the younger brother receives $10k$, and we require $10k < 10$, so $k < 1$. Thus $k = 0$, which means $n = 1$.

The older brother receives $10(k+1)$ and the younger brother receives $10k$.  The condition is $10k < 10$, which means $k<1$.  So the only possible value is $k=0$, $n=1$.
