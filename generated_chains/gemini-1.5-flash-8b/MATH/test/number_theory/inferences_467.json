At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYour friend has an egg collection comprising at least $200$ eggs. He wants to store them in dozen-egg containers. After filling as many containers as possible, the last container had $1$ egg left over. He then decided to store his eggs in customized baker-dozen-egg containers, where each container can hold $13$ eggs. It turns out that, after filling as many of these containers as possible, he still has $1$ egg left over. What is the minimum number of eggs that your friend could have?",
        "inference": "Let $N$ be the number of eggs.\nWe are given that $N \\ge 200$.\nThe first condition states that when storing the eggs in dozen-egg containers, the last container has 1 egg left over. This means that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\nThe second condition states that when storing the eggs in baker-dozen-egg containers (13 eggs each), the last container has 1 egg left over. This means that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nWe are looking for the smallest $N \\ge 200$ such that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ and $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$.\nSince $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ and $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, we have $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{\\text{lcm}(12,13)}$.\nSince 12 and 13 are coprime, $\\text{lcm}(12,13) = 12 \\times 13 = 156$.\nSo we have $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{156}$.\nThe smallest integer greater than or equal to 200 that satisfies $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{156}$ is $N = 156k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nWe want $156k + 1 \\ge 200$.\n$156k \\ge 199$.\n$k \\ge \\frac{199}{156} \\approx 1.28$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, we take $k=2$.\nThen $N = 156(2) + 1 = 312 + 1 = 313$.\nWe check if 313 is greater than or equal to 200.\n$313 \\ge 200$, which is true.\nSo the minimum number of eggs is 313.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{313}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We want the smallest integer $x$ such that $x \\ge 200$ and $x$ gives a remainder of $1$ when divided by both $12$ and $13$. We can write $x = 12 \\cdot 13n + 1 = 156n+1$, so now we need to find a sufficiently large value of $n$ such that $x \\ge 200$. If $n = 1$, $x = 157$, but when $n = 2$, $x = 313$.
