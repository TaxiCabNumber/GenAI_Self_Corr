All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?",

        "ground_truth": "Let there be $x$ rows with $y$ band members per row in Formation $A$. Then we have $xy=105$. From the information about Formation $B$, we have $(x+6)(y-2)=105$.

We now substitute $3y-6$ for $x$ in $xy=105$ and use the quadratic formula to solve the resulting quadratic equation, $3y^2-6y-105=0$. The positive solution, $y=7$, gives $x=15$.
