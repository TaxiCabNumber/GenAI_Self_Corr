        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the first day of a month is Monday, what day of the week is the twenty-third day?",
        "inference": "Monday is the first day.\nThe days of the week are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\nThe days of the month are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.\nThe 1st is Monday.\nThe 2nd is Tuesday.\nThe 3rd is Wednesday.\nThe 4th is Thursday.\nThe 5th is Friday.\nThe 6th is Saturday.\nThe 7th is Sunday.\nThe 8th is Monday.\nThe 9th is Tuesday.\nThe 10th is Wednesday.\nThe 11th is Thursday.\nThe 12th is Friday.\nThe 13th is Saturday.\nThe 14th is Sunday.\nThe 15th is Monday.\nThe 16th is Tuesday.\nThe 17th is Wednesday.\nThe 18th is Thursday.\nThe 19th is Friday.\nThe 20th is Saturday.\nThe 21st is Sunday.\nThe 22nd is Monday.\nThe 23rd is Tuesday.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Tuesday}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The days of the week repeat every $7$ days. So days $1, 1+7, 1+14, \\ldots$ are all on Mondays. Since day $22=1+21$ is a Monday, the twenty-third day is a $\\boxed{\\text{Tuesday}}$. In other words, if the remainder when $n$ is divided by $7$ is $1$, the $n$th day is a Monday. The remainder when $23$ is divided by $7$ is $2$, so the day is one day after Monday. That's Tuesday."
