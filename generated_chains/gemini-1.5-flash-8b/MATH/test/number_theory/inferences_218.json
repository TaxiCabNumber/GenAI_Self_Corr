The sum is 0 + _ = _.\nThe difference between the sum of the odd place digits and the sum of the even place digits must be 0 or a multiple of 11.\nLet the missing digit be $x$.

This is a valid digit.\nIf $9 - x = 11$, then $x = 9 - 11 = -2$, which is not a valid digit.\nIf $9 - x = -11$, then $x = 9 + 11 = 20$, which is not a valid digit.\nThus, the only possible value for $x$ that makes the number divisible by 11 is 9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "A number will be divisible by 11 if you get a multiple of 11 by alternately adding and then subtracting its digits.  If we name the blank integer $A$, then the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + A - 7 = A -5$.  This value can only be equal to 0 (as 11, 22, etc all yield $A$ that are too large), so $A = \\boxed{5}$ is the only digit that will work."
