        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZach has three bags and a bunch of pencils to be placed into the bags. He is told to place the greatest number of pencils possible into each of the three bags while also keeping the number of pencils in each bag the same. What is the greatest number of pencils he could have left over?",
        "inference": "To maximize the number of pencils in each bag while keeping the number of pencils the same in each of the three bags, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total number of pencils and 3.  However, the problem doesn't give a total number of pencils.\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of pencils in each bag, we can think about the remainder when dividing the total number of pencils by 3.  If we have a total of N pencils, then N = 3a + r, where a is the number of pencils in each bag and r is the remainder.\nThe possible remainders when dividing by 3 are 0, 1, or 2.\nIf the remainder is 0, there are no pencils left over.\nIf the remainder is 1, then 1 pencil is left over.\nIf the remainder is 2, then 2 pencils are left over.\n\nThus, the greatest number of pencils that could be left over is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Zach has three or more pencils left over, then he can add another pencil to each bag.  Therefore, Zach can have at most $\\boxed{2}$ pencils left over."

        "inference": "Let $N$ be the total number of pencils.  We want to divide $N$ pencils into 3 bags, with the same number of pencils in each bag.  This means we want to find the largest possible number of pencils in each bag.  The number of pencils in each bag must be an integer.\nWe are looking for the largest possible number of pencils in each bag, which is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the total number of pencils and the number of bags (3).  The problem doesn't give a total number of pencils, so the maximum possible remainder when dividing by 3 is 2.\n\nSince the number of pencils must be divisible by 3, the remainder when dividing by 3 must be 0. The largest possible number of pencils in each bag is obtained by dividing $N$ by 3.  This will not result in any leftover pencils.\nHowever, the question is asking about the maximum number of pencils that can *remain* in the bags, not the maximum number of pencils per bag.\nThe maximum number of pencils that could remain in the bags is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$\n",
