We want to find the integers $k$ such that $-100 \\le 11k+3 \\le 100$.\n\nFirst, we consider the inequality $-100 \\le 11k+3$. Subtracting $3$ from both sides gives $-103 \\le 11k$. Dividing both sides by $11$, we get $-\\frac{103}{11} \\le k$. Since $-\\frac{103}{11} \\approx -9.36$, the smallest integer $k$ satisfying this inequality is $k=-9$.\n\nNext, we consider the inequality $11k+3 \\le 100$. Subtracting $3$ from both sides gives $11k \\le 97$. Dividing both sides by $11$, we get $k \\le \\frac{97}{11}$. Since $\\frac{97}{11} \\approx 8.818$, the largest integer $k$ satisfying this inequality is $k=8$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $k$ are $-9, -8, -7, \\dots, 7, 8$. The number of integers from $-9$ to $8$ inclusive is $8 - (-9) + 1 = 8 + 9 + 1 = 18$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
