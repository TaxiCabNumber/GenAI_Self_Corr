        "inference": "The expression is $\\frac{21j+9}{7}$.  We can write $21j = 7 \\times 3j$, which is a multiple of 7.\nThus, $\\frac{21j}{7} = 3j$, which is an integer.\nWe have $\\frac{21j+9}{7} = \\frac{21j}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} = 3j + \\frac{9}{7}$.\nDividing 9 by 7 gives $9 = 1 \\times 7 + 2$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{9}{7} = 1 + \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThen, $3j + \\frac{9}{7} = 3j + 1 + \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe remainder when $3j + 1 + \\frac{2}{7}$ is divided by 7 is the same as the remainder when $\\frac{2}{7}$ is divided by 7.\nTo find the remainder when $\\frac{2}{7}$ is divided by 7, we can consider the equivalent fraction $\\frac{2}{7} \\times 7$.\nThen the numerator is 2.
