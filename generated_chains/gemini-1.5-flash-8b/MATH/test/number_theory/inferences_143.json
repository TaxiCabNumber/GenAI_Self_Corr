We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse.\n$100 = 7(14) + 2$\n$14 = 7(2) + 0$\nSo, we need to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $14x + 100y = 1$.\nWorking backwards:\n$2 = 100 - 7(14)$\n$1 = 14(0) + 100(1) - 7(14)(1)$\n$1 = 100(1) + 14(-7)$\nSince $14(-7) + 100(1) = 1$, we have $-7(14) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$, so $14(-7) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$.
