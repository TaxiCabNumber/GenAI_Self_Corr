At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree consecutive primes are summed. When the sum is squared, the result is 72,361. What is the largest of the three primes?",

Since primes are integers, we need to find three consecutive primes whose sum is close to 269.\n4. Consider primes around 269/3 = 89.67.  Primes near 89 are 83, 89, 97.\n5. 83 + 89 + 97 = 269.\n6.
