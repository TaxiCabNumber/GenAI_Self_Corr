        "inference": "1. We are looking for a prime number greater than 25.\n2. The prime numbers greater than 25 are 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, and so on.\n3. We need to find a prime number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 25. This means the number can be expressed as 25n + 2, where n is an integer.\n4. Let's check each prime number:\n   - For 29: 29 = 25(1) + 4, remainder is 4.\n   - For 31: 31 = 25(1) + 6, remainder is 6.\n   - For 37: 37 = 25(1) + 12, remainder is 12.\n   - For 41: 41 = 25(1) + 16, remainder is 16.\n   - For 43: 43 = 25(1) + 18, remainder is 18.\n   - For 47: 47 = 25(1) + 22, remainder is 22.\n   - For 52: 52 = 25(2) + 2, remainder is 2.\n5. The first prime number greater than 25 that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 25 is 52.\n   However, 52 = 2^2 * 13, so it is not a prime number.\n6. Let's continue checking primes:\n   - For 57: 57 = 25(2) + 7, remainder is 7.\n   - For 62: 62 = 25(2) + 12, remainder is 12.\n7. Continue testing primes greater than 25,\n- 72 = 25(2) + 22, remainder is 22\n- 77 = 25(3) + 2, remainder is 2.\n8. Therefore, the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25 is 77. However, 77 = 7 * 11 which is not a prime.\n9. Keep checking. The primes are 29, 31, ..., 77, ..., 97 etc.\n10. 77 = 7 x 11. \n11.  Let's continue to check.\n    25*3 + 2 = 77, which is 7 * 11, not a prime.\n12. 25*4 + 2 = 102, not a prime.\n13. Trying to find a pattern.\n14.  Let's try 25(n) + 2\n15.  25*3 +2 = 77 (not prime). \n16.  25*5 +2 = 127. Prime\n17. Thus, 127 is a prime number greater than 25 and has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{127}$",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the least prime number, $p$, such that $p=25n+2$ for some positive integer $n$. It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25."
