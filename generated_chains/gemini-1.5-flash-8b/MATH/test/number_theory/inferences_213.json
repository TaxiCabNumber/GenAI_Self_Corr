        "inference": "The problem states that the two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits.  Let the integer be $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits from 1 to 9.  The equation is $10a + b = 2(a + b)$.  This simplifies to $10a + b = 2a + 2b$, which further simplifies to $8a = b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $a$ can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.  When $a=1$, $b=8$, the integer is $10(1) + 8 = 18$. The sum of the digits is $1+8=9$.  Twice the sum is $2(1+8) = 18$, which works.  Thus the integer is 18.\n\n$\\boxed{18}$\n",
