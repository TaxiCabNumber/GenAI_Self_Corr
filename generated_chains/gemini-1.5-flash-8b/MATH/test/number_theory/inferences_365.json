Find the prime factorization of 1452.\n   1452 = 2^2 * 3 * 11^2 * 1\n\n3. List the divisors of 1452.\n   The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 33, 44, 66, 121, 132, 242, 363, 484, 726, 968, 1089, 1452.\n\n\n4. Count the divisors that are integers from 1 to 6.\n   The divisors from 1 to 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n   Therefore, there are 5 divisors of 1452 that are between 1 and 6.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "All numbers are divisible by $1$. The last two digits, $52$, form a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by $4$, and thus $2$. $1+4+5+2=12$, which is a multiple of $3$, so $1452$ is divisible by $3$.  Since it is divisible by $2$ and $3$, it is divisible by $6$.  But it is not divisible by $5$ as it does not end in $5$ or $0$.  So the total is $\\boxed{5}$."
