At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "We first recognize that $132=11\\times 12$, so its prime factorization is $132 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$. We only need to see if these three prime factors will divide into $6432$. Indeed, $6432$ will satisfy the divisibility properties for both $3$ and $4$, and we can long divide to see that $11$ does not divide into $6432$. Thus, the greatest common factor is $3 \\times 4 = 12$. The greatest common factor increased by 11 is $12+11 = \\boxed{23}$."
