At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stadium staircase with 150 steps is numbered from 1 to 150. Jan starts on step 130 and steps down to step number 127, then to step number 124, and continues downward to step 13 stepping only on every third step. Jen starts on step number 3 and steps up to step number 7, then to step number 11, and continues upward to step 139 stepping only on every fourth step. How many steps were stepped on by both Jan and Jen (not necessarily at the same time)?",
