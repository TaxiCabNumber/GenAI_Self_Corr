        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSome fractions can be expressed as repeating decimals. Given that $\\frac{1}{7}=0.14285714285$..., what is the 9th digit to the right of the decimal in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{7}$?",
        "inference": "To find the 9th digit to the right of the decimal in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{7}$, we can first multiply the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ by 3.\n$\\frac{3}{7} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = 3 \\times 0.14285714285...$\n$3 \\times 0.142857 = 0.428571$\nThe decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Then $\\frac{3}{7} = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{7} = 3 \\times 0.\\overline{142857} = 0.\\overline{428571}$.\nThe digits repeat in a cycle of 6.  The 9th digit is the same as the 3rd digit in the cycle. The digits in the cycle are 4, 2, 8, 5, 7, 1. The 3rd digit in the cycle is 8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\frac17$ repeats every 6 digits, so does $3\\cdot\\frac17=\\frac37$. The 9th digit is therefore the same as the third digit. If we multiply $\\frac17$ by  3, we get $.4285\\ldots$, which has a third digit of $\\boxed{8}$."
