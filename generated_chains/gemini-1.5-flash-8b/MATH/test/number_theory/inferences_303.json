The ten thousands place is 8, so the number is in the range 80000 to 89999.\nPerfect cubes between 10000 and 99999 are those numbers that have a cube root between 21 and 46.  We are looking for perfect cubes in the 80000s.\n$21^3 = 9261$, $22^3 = 10648$, $23^3 = 12167$, ..., $46^3 = 97336$\n$21^3$ is too small.
