At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the two consecutive positive even integers be $n$ and $n+2$.\nTheir product is $n(n+2) = 288$.\nExpanding the equation, we get $n^2 + 2n = 288$.\nRearranging the equation, we get $n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0$.\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to -288 and add to 2.\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we have $(n+18)(n-16) = 0$.\nThis gives us two possible values for $n$: $n=-18$ or $n=16$.\nSince the integers are positive, we take $n=16$.\nThe consecutive even integer is $n+2 = 16+2 = 18$.\nThe two consecutive positive even integers are 16 and 18.\nThe greater of the two integers is 18.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $\\boxed{18}$."
