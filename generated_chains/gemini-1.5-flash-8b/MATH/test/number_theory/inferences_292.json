Thus, $b = n$.\nWe want to find the greatest possible value of $n$.\nIf $b=n=1$, then $10a+1$ is divisible by 1. Any $a$ works.\nIf $b=n=2$, then $10a+2$ is divisible by 2. Any even $a$ works.\nIf $b=n=3$, then $10a+3$ is divisible by 3. This means $a+3$ is divisible by 3.\nIf $b=n=4$, then $10a+4$ is divisible by 4. $10a+4 \\equiv 2a+4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4 \\Rightarrow 2a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, so $a$ must be even.\nIf $b=n=5$, then $10a+5$ is divisible by 5.

Not divisible by 7.\nIf $b=n=8$, then $10a+8$ is divisible by 8. $10a+8 \\equiv 2a+8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, $2a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies a$ is a multiple of 4, so $a=4$ or $a=8$.\nIf $b=n=9$, then $10a+9$ is divisible by 9.  $10a+9 \\equiv a+9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$.
