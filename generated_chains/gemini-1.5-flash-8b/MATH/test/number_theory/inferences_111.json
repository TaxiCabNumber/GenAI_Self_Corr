At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA three-digit number has the same hundreds, tens and units digit.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 47. What is the three-digit number?",
        "inference": "Let the three-digit number be $abc$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.  Since the digits are the same, we can write the number as $aaa = 111a$.\nThe prime factors of 111 are 3, 37.  So $111a = 3 \\times 37 \\times a$.\nThe sum of the prime factors is $3 + 37 + a = 40 + a$.  We are given that the sum of the prime factors is 47.\nSo $40 + a = 47$, which means $a = 7$.\nThe three-digit number is 777.\nThe prime factorization of 777 is $3 \\times 7 \\times 37$.\nThe sum of the prime factors is $3+7+37 = 47$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{777}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can tell that the three-digit number will be 111 times some number $x$ (resulting in 111, 222,...999), so the prime factors of the three-digit number will contain the prime factors of 111, which has prime factorization $3\\cdot37$. The sum of those two prime factors is 40, which means that $x$ is $47-40=7$. So, our answer is $111\\cdot7=\\boxed{777}$."
