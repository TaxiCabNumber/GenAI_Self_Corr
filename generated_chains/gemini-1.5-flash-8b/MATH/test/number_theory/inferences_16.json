At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product (in base 10) of the first and last digits of the base-6 representation of $682_{10}$?",
        "inference": "To find the base-6 representation of $682_{10}$, we perform successive divisions by 6.\n$682 \\div 6 = 113$ with a remainder of 4.\n$113 \\div 6 = 18$ with a remainder of 5.\n$18 \\div 6 = 3$ with a remainder of 0.\n$3 \\div 6 = 0$ with a remainder of 3.\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives the base-6 representation as $3054_6$.\nThe first digit is 3 and the last digit is 4.\nThe product of the first and last digits is $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by converting $682_{10}$ into base-6. We see that $6^3=216$ is the largest power of 6 that is less than 682, and that $3\\cdot216=648$ is the largest multiple of 216 that is less than 682. This leaves us with a remainder of $682-648=34$, which we can express as $5\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0$. So, $682_{10}=3\\cdot6^3+0\\cdot6^2+5\\cdot{6^1}+4\\cdot6^0=3054_6$. The first and last digits are 3 and 4, respectively, making the product of the two equal to $\\boxed{12}$."
