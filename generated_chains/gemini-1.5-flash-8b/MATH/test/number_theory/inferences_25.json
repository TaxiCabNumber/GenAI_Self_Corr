        "inference": "1. We are given that $x=720$ and $ax$ is a perfect cube. This means $ax = n^3$ for some positive integer $n$.\n2. We have $720a = n^3$.\n3. To find the smallest possible value of $n$, we need to find the prime factorization of 720:\n   $720 = 72 \\times 10 = 8 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1$.\n4. For $720a$ to be a perfect cube, the exponents of the prime factors in the prime factorization of $720a$ must be multiples of 3.\n   So, we need to multiply 720 by the smallest positive integer $a$ such that the exponents in the prime factorization of $720a$ are multiples of 3.\n   The prime factorization of $720$ is $2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1$.\n   To make the exponents multiples of 3, we need to multiply by $2^{3-4} \\times 3^{3-2} \\times 5^{3-1} = 2^{-1} \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 25 = \\frac{75}{2}$.\n   Since $a$ must be an integer, we need to multiply $720$ by $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 25 = 300$.\n5. Then $ax = 720 \\times 300 = 216,000 = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 = 2^6 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^3 = (2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5)^3 = 60^3$.\n6.

        "ground_truth": "First we find the prime factorization of 720, which is $2^4\\cdot3^2\\cdot 5$. In order to make a perfect cube, we need two more factors of 2, another factor of 3 and two more factors of 5.
