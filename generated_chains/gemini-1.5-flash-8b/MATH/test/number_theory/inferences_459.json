        "inference": "1. Days with a 3 in the tens digit of the day of the month are the following:\n   30, 31\n   13, 23, 33, ...\n2. The days with a 3 in the tens digit are: 13, 23\n3. Months with 30 days: September, April, June, November\n   - 30, 31 in Sept, 31 in Oct...\n4. Months with 30 days: September, April, June, November.  The days are 13, 23.\n   - September: 13, 23\n   - April: 13, 23\n   - June: 13, 23\n   - November: 13, 23\n5. Months with 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, December. The days are 13, 23\n   - January: 13, 23\n   - March: 13, 23\n   - May: 13, 23\n   - July: 13, 23\n   - August: 13, 23\n   - October: 13, 23\n   - December: 13, 23\n6. Months with 28 or 29 days (February):\n   - February: 13, 23 (In a non-leap year, 28 days, 13 and 23 are there. In a leap year, 29 days, 13 and 23 are there.)\n7.  So in all months, we have 13 and 23.\n8. In a non-leap year, there are 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 365 days.\n9. For each month, there are 2 days (13 and 23) which have a 3 in the tens digit, and there are 12 months. So there are 12 * 2 = 24 days in a non-leap year.\n10. In a leap year, there are 366 days, and 24 days have a 3 in the tens digit.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $12$ months in a year.  January, March, May, July, August, October, and December have $31$ days, so there are $7$ months with $2$ days that have a $3$ in the tens digit.  April, June, September, and November each have $1$ day with a $3$ in the tens place, and February has none.  Therefore, there are $7\\times2+4=\\boxed{18}$ days with a $3$ in the tens digit.\n\nAlternatively, this problem can be solved by subtraction.  There are $365$ days in a year, and $11$ months have $29$ days without a $3$ in the tens digit, and the last month has $28$ (assuming a non-leap year).  $365-(11\\times29)-28=\\boxed{18}$"
