        "inference": "To write $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$ as a decimal, we first calculate $2^{10}$.\n$2^{10} = 1024$.\nSo $\\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1024}$.\nWe can write this as $1 \\div 1024$.\nTo divide 1 by 1024, we need to move the decimal point 10 places to the left.\nSince $1024$ has 4 digits, we need to add zeros until we have 10 digits to the right of the decimal point.\n$$ 1 \\div 1024 = 0.0009765625 $$\nThe number of digits to the right of the decimal point is 10.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$",
        "ground_truth": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This implies that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$.
