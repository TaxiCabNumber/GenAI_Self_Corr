At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20?",
        "inference": "To minimize the five-digit number, we want the first digit to be as small as possible.  The smallest possible first digit is 1.  To minimize the remaining digits, we want the digits to be as small as possible.\nIf the first digit is 1, the remaining digits must sum to 19.  We can use 1, 2, 3, 4, 9.  This gives us the number 12349.  The sum of these digits is 1+2+3+4+9 = 19.  This is close to 20, but we need 20.\nIf the first digit is 2, the remaining digits must sum to 18.  Using 2, 1, 1, 3, 11, we could have 21111, but we need non-zero digits.\nTrying 21221, the sum is 8.  21221+8 = 29.

If the first digit is 1, the remaining digits sum to 19.  We need to use smaller digits.\nLet's try 12359.  1+2+3+5+9 = 20.\nThe five-digit number is 12359.\n\nThe smallest possible digits that sum to 20, are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.  The number is 12359.\nThe sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 9 = 20\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12359}$",
        "ground_truth": "For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\\boxed{11189}$."
