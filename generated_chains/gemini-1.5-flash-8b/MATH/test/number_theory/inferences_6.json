        "inference": "1. Time until 8:35 a.m. from 5:13 a.m.: 8:35 - 5:13 = 3 hours and 22 minutes.\n2. Convert 3 hours and 22 minutes to minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 22 minutes = 180 minutes + 22 minutes = 202 minutes.\n3. Calculate how many full 20-minute cycles are in 202 minutes: 202 minutes / 20 minutes/cycle = 10.1 cycles.\n4. Since Jerry needs to wait for the next bus, round up the number of cycles to 11.\n5. Calculate the waiting time: 11 cycles * 20 minutes/cycle = 220 minutes.\n6. Calculate how many minutes Jerry needs to wait from the last bus time (at 8:35 a.m.) to the next bus: 220 minutes - 202 minutes = 18 minutes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 20 minutes evenly divides 60 minutes (which is an hour), the bus stops every 13 minutes, $13 + 20 = 33$ minutes, and $33 + 20 = 53$ minutes past the hour.  So after 8:35 AM, the next time that the bus stops is 8:53 AM, so Jerry must wait $53 - 35 = \\boxed{18}$ minutes."

        "inference": "The problem is unclear about the starting point of the next bus.  If the problem means the next bus after 8:35 am, it is unclear how the 20-minute schedule works, which is critical to solving the problem.  Without more information, it is impossible to determine the exact waiting time.\n\n\nLet's assume the problem intended for the bus schedule to start at a whole hour or half hour and increment from there with a 20-minute interval.\n\n\nAssuming the bus schedule starts at 5:00 a.m. and follows a 20 minute interval.\n\n\nThe given time is 8:35 a.m.  The last bus arrived at 8:35 a.m..\n\n\nFrom 5:00 AM, the possible bus times are: 5:00, 5:20, 5:40, 6:00, 6:20, ..., 8:00, 8:20, 8:40\n\n\nThe last bus departed at 8:35 a.m.  We need to find the next bus time after 8:35. The next bus time will be 9:00 a.m..\n\n\nThe waiting time is 9:00 - 8:35 = 25 minutes.\n\n$\\boxed{25}$\n",
