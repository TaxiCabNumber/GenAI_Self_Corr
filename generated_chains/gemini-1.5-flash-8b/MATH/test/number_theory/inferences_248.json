At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?",
