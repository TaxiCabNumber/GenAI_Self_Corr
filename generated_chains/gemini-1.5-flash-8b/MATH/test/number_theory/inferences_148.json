This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.\n\nSince the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases. So our final number of correct answers is $40 + 2 = \\boxed{42}$."
