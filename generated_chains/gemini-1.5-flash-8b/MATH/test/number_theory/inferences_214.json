        "inference": "For a fraction $\\frac{n}{d}$ to be a terminating decimal, the denominator $d$ must have only powers of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nFor $\\frac{17k}{66}$ to be a terminating decimal, the denominator 66 must be $2^a 5^b$. But $66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$. Since the denominator already has factors of 3 and 11, $k$ must have factors of 3 and 11 to cancel those factors. Thus, $k$ must be a multiple of 3 and 11.\n\nFor $\\frac{13k}{105}$ to be a terminating decimal, the denominator 105 must be $2^a 5^b$. But $105 = 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.  Since the denominator already has factors of 3, 5, and 7, $k$ must have factors of 3, 5, and 7 to cancel those factors.\n\nWe want $k$ to have factors of 3, 5, 7, 11 to make both fractions terminating decimals.\nThus, $k$ must be a multiple of $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 1155$.\nWe are given that $k$ is in the set $S$, and we want the smallest integer in $S$ greater than 2010.\nSince $k = 1155n$ for some integer $n$, we want the smallest integer $n$ such that $1155n > 2010$.\n$\\frac{2010}{1155} \\approx 1.74$.
