At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is used once and only once to form a six-digit integer. What is the largest six-digit multiple of 4 that can be formed?",
        "inference": "To form the largest six-digit multiple of 4, we need to use the digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\nA number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number divisible by 4.\nThe possible two-digit numbers divisible by 4 using the digits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are:\n36, 48, 64, 76, 84, 96\nThe largest possible two-digit number is 96.\nWe arrange the remaining digits in descending order to form the largest possible six-digit number.\nThe remaining digits are 3, 4, 7, 8. Arranging them in descending order gives 8743.\nThe largest six-digit number that can be formed using the given digits is 987643.\nWe consider the two-digit numbers formed by the last two digits. The numbers are:\n36, 48, 64, 76, 84, 96\nThe largest two-digit number divisible by 4 is 96.\nThe remaining digits are 3, 4, 7, 8.\nWe arrange these in descending order to get 8743.\nTherefore, the largest six-digit number that can be formed is 987436.\nIf we arrange the remaining digits in descending order to form the largest possible number, we get 8743.\nSo the largest possible number is 987436.\nWe need to check if 987436 is divisible by 4. The last two digits are 36.\n36 is divisible by 4 (36 / 4 = 9).\nTherefore, 987436 is divisible by 4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{987436}$",
        "ground_truth": "Divisibility by 4 depends only on the last two digits, since 100 is divisible by 4.  Therefore, to form the largest possible multiple of 4, we must use the smallest pair of digits which form a multiple of 4 as the last two digits and place the remaining digits in descending order in the first four positions.  Neither 43 nor 34 is a multiple of 4, but the next smallest pair of digits does form a multiple of 4, namely 36.  Therefore, the smallest multiple of 4 using the given digits is $\\boxed{987,\\!436}$."
