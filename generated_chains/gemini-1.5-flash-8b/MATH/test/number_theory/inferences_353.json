        "inference": "The sum of four two-digit numbers is 221.\nThe possible values for the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nWe want to find the digit that does not appear in one of the four two-digit numbers.\n\nThe sum of four two-digit numbers is 221.\nThe smallest possible sum is $10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 46$.\nThe largest possible sum is $98 + 97 + 96 + 95 = 386$.\nThe average value of a two-digit number is $\\frac{10+99}{2} = \\frac{109}{2} = 54.5$.\nSo, the sum of four numbers is approximately $4 \\times 54.5 = 218$.\n$221 - 218 = 3$.\n\nSince the sum of the four numbers is 221, we can consider the average of the four numbers, which is about $221/4 = 55.25$.\nPossible numbers near 55 are 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59.\nWe need a sum of 221, so we can try decomposing the sum.\n$10 + 10 + 10 + 191 = 221$. No, this is not possible.\nConsider $50 + 50 + 50 + 71 = 221$.\nSo we have two sets of numbers, 50, 50, 50, 71.\nHowever, all digits must be different and not zero.\nLet's try some combinations:\n$20 + 30 + 50 + 121 = 221$.  No, this is not possible.\n$10 + 20 + 50 + 141 = 221$.\n$20 + 50 + 70 + 81 = 221$. This is a good starting point.\nThe numbers are 20, 50, 70, 81.\nThe sum is 221.\n\nWe can have 20 + 50 + 70 + 81 = 221.

        "ground_truth": "The sum of the digits 1 through 9 is 45, so the sum of the eight digits is between 36 and 44, inclusive. The sum of the four units digits is between $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$ and $6 + 7 + 8 + 9 =30$, inclusive, and also ends in 1. Therefore the sum of the units digits is either 11 or 21. If the sum of the units digits is 11, then the sum of the tens digits is 21, so the sum of all eight digits is 32, an impossibility. If the sum of the units digits is 21, then the sum of the tens digits is 20, so the sum of all eight digits is 41. Thus the missing digit is $45 - 41 = \\boxed{4}$. Note that the numbers $13, 25, 86,$ and $97$ sum to $221$."
