At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKirsty needs to hire a plumber to fix her house. The plumber charges $242_5$ dollars for every hour of labor and $367_{8}$ dollars for equipment. If the plumber works for $3.5_{10}$ hours, how many dollars (in base ten) will Kirsty owe the plumber?",
