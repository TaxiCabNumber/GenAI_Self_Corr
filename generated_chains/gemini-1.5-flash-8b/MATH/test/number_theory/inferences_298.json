        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?",
        "inference": "Let $m$ be the distance on the map in inches and $r$ be the real-life distance in miles. We are given that 3 inches on the map corresponds to 10 miles in real life. This can be written as a ratio:\n$\\frac{3 \\text{ inches}}{10 \\text{ miles}}$.\nWe are given that the real-life distance between the two buildings is 53.25 miles. We want to find the distance between the buildings on the map, which we denote by $m$.\nWe can set up a proportion:\n$\\frac{3 \\text{ inches}}{10 \\text{ miles}} = \\frac{m \\text{ inches}}{53.25 \\text{ miles}}$\nTo solve for $m$, we can cross-multiply:\n$3 \\times 53.25 = 10 \\times m$\n$159.75 = 10m$\nDivide both sides by 10:\n$m = \\frac{159.75}{10} = 15.975$ inches.\nSince we are asked to express the answer as a fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$15.975 = 15\\frac{975}{1000} = 15\\frac{39}{40} = \\frac{15 \\times 40 + 39}{40} = \\frac{600 + 39}{40} = \\frac{639}{40}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{639}{40}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If we let the distance between the buildings on the map be $d$, then $\\frac{d}{53.25} = \\frac{3}{10}$. Cross-multiplying and solving for $d$, we obtain $10d = 159.75 \\Rightarrow d=15.975$ inches. Expressed as a fraction, $d = 15\\frac{975}{1000} = \\boxed{15\\frac{39}{40}},$ or $\\boxed{\\frac{639}{40}}$ inches."
