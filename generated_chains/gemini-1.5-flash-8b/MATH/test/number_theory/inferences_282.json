(In the equation below, $AA$ represents a two-digit number both of whose digits are $A$.) $$A+B=C$$$$AA-B=2\\times C$$$$C\\times B=AA+A$$",
        "inference": "From the first equation, $A+B=C$.\nFrom the second equation, $AA-B=2C \\Rightarrow 11A-B=2C$.\nFrom the third equation, $CB=AA+A \\Rightarrow 10C+B = 11A+A = 11A$.\nSubstitute $C=A+B$ into the equation $10C+B=11A$. We get $10(A+B)+B=11A$, which simplifies to $10A+10B+B=11A$, or $10A+11B=11A$, so $11B=A$. Since $A, B$ are digits from 1 to 9, $A$ must be a multiple of 11, which means $A=11$. This is impossible.\nInstead, substitute $C=A+B$ into the second equation: $11A-B=2(A+B)$. This simplifies to $11A-B=2A+2B$, which gives $9A=3B$, or $3A=B$.\nSubstitute $C=A+B=A+3A=4A$ into the third equation: $CB=AA+A$, which becomes $(4A)B=11A+A=12A$.\nSince $B=3A$, we have $4A(3A)=12A$, which simplifies to $12A^2=12A$. Dividing by $12A$ gives $A=1$.\nIf $A=1$, then $B=3(1)=3$, and $C=A+B=1+3=4$.\nWe need to check if these values satisfy the equations.\n$1+3=4$, which is true.\n$11(1)-3=8$, and $2C=2(4)=8$. This is true.\n$4\\times3=12$, and $11(1)+1=12$. This is true.\nSo the values $A=1, B=3, C=4$ are valid.\nThe sum $A+B+C = 1+3+4 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
