At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the four consecutive positive odd numbers be $2n+1, 2n+3, 2n+5, 2n+7$ for some positive integer $n$.  Their sum is\n$(2n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+5) + (2n+7) = 8n + 16 = 8(n+2)$.\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n+2$ is a positive integer. Thus, the sum is $8(n+2)$.\n\nSince $8(n+2)$ is a multiple of 8, the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, and $2n+3$ be four consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)=8n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $8$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{8}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor."
