At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn any month with a Friday the Thirteenth, what day of the week is the first day of the same month?",
        "inference": "1. A Friday the 13th means that the 13th day of the month falls on a Friday.\n2. Since the week repeats every 7 days, the 6th day of the month falls 7 days prior to the 13th, which is a Friday - 7 = Monday.\n3. The 6th day of the month is one day after the 5th, which is two days after the 4th, etc. Each day is a difference of one day before the previous day.\n4. Thus, the first day of the month is the day which is 5 days prior to the 6th day, which is Monday - 5 = Saturday.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Saturday}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the 13th is a Friday, then the 14th is a Saturday, and the 15th is a Sunday.  Subtracting 14 days (which is two weeks), we find that the first of the month is also a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$."
