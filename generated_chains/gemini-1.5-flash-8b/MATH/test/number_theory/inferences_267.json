At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nArnold must water his cactus plants every 9 days and he must feed them every 60 days. He watered and fed them last Tuesday. What day of the week will it be the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day?",
        "inference": "To find the next time Arnold waters and feeds his cactus plants on the same day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 60.\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of each number:\n9 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 3\u00b2\n60 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorizations:\nLCM(9, 60) = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 5 = 180\n\nSo, Arnold will water and feed his cactus plants together every 180 days.\n\nIf last Tuesday was day 0, and the cycle repeats every 180 days, then the next time it will be a Tuesday again is 180 days from Tuesday.\nTo find the day of the week 180 days from Tuesday, we need to find the remainder when 180 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n180 \u00f7 7 = 25 with a remainder of 5.\nThis means that 180 days from Tuesday will be 5 days later in the week.\n\nTuesday + 5 days = Sunday\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Sunday}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The next time he feeds and waters them on the same day is after $\\text{lcm}(9,60)=180$ days.  Now to determine the day of the week we compute  \\[180\\equiv5\\pmod7.\\] This day falls 5 days later in the week than a Tuesday, so he next feeds them on the same day on a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$."
