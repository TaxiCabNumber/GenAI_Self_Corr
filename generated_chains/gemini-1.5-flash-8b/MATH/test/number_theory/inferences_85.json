At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCarlos Montado was born on Saturday, November 9, 2002.  On what day of the week will Carlos be 706 days old? (Spell out the entire day of the week.)",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of weeks: 706 days / 7 days/week = 101 weeks with a remainder of 1 day.\n\n2. Determine the starting day: Carlos was born on a Saturday.\n\n3. Add the remainder of days to the starting day: 1 day after Saturday is Sunday.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Sunday}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
