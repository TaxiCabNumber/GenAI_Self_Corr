At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of the year on the planet Mars is exactly 697 days. If Mars has a calendar with a 12-day week, and year 0 begins on the first day of the week, what is the next year which will begin on the first day of the week?",
        "inference": "697 days / 12 days/week = 58 weeks with a remainder of 1 day.\nYear 0 starts on the first day of the week.\nYear 1 starts on the second day of the week.\nYear 2 starts on the third day of the week.\n...\nYear 11 starts on the twelfth day of the week, which is the first day of the week.\nSo the next year that starts on the first day of the week is year 12.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $697 = 12 \\cdot 58 + 1$, each Martian year consists of 58 weeks and a day.  Therefore, for every year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  Since year 0 begins on the first day, year 1 begins on the second day, then year 2 begins on the third day, and so on.  A week consists of 12 days, so the next year that begins on the first day again will be year $\\boxed{12}$."
