        "inference": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ is given by $n^{\\frac{x-1}{2}}$, where $x$ is the number of positive divisors of $n$.  By the definition of the product of divisors, we have the product of the proper divisors of $n$ is $n^{(x-1)/2}$. \nIn this case, we are given $n^{(ax+b)/c} = n^{(x-1)/2}$. Comparing the exponents, we have $\\frac{ax+b}{c} = \\frac{x-1}{2}$. This implies $2(ax+b) = c(x-1)$.  Expanding, $2ax+2b = cx-c$.\nRearranging, $2ax-cx = -c-2b$.  Factoring out $x$, $(2a-c)x = -c-2b$.\nIf $2a-c=0$, then $c=2a$. In this case, we have $0 = -c-2b$. Thus, $c=-2b$.\nWe need $gcd(a,b,c)=1$. Since $c=2a$ and $c=-2b$, this implies $2a = -2b$, which means $a=-b$.  This contradicts the condition that $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$.\nSince $2a-c = 0$, $2a=c$. Thus, $x$ must divide $-c-2b$, which is $-2a-2b = -2(a+b)$.  Thus, $2a-c = 0$ leads to $x | -2(a+b)$. \nLet $2a-c = 1$. Then $x = \\frac{-c-2b}{2a-c} = -c-2b$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, $-2b-c > 0$.  \nIf $2a-c = 1$, $c = 2a-1$.  Then $x(2a-c) = -c-2b$.  So $x = -c-2b$, but $x$ is positive.  \nWe want $c = 2a-1$ and $-c-2b=x$.  We know that $-2(a+b) = x \\implies x=2a-1$.  Since $-2(a+b)$ is divisible by $2a-1$, we have $2a-1=1$.  Then $2a=2$, so $a=1$.  Then $c=1$ and $b=-1/2$, but $b$ must be an integer.  \nIf we let $2a-c = -1$. Then $c = 2a+1$.  Then $-2a-2b = x(2a-c) = -x$. Then $2a+1 = 2a-1$ is impossible.\nHowever, if $2a-c = 1$, we must have $2a - c = 2b + c = x$.  Then $2a+2b = x$ and $c=2a$.\nIf $2a-c = 1$.  $2a - (2a-1)=1$, $1=1$.  $x=-2b-c$.\n$x = 1$, $2(ax+b)/c = (x-1)/2 \\implies 2a+2b = c(x-1)/2$.  Then $2(a+b) = 2a - 1 - 2b$, so $a = -1$. $c=1$.  $a=1$, $b=0$.\nLet $a=1, b=0, c=2$. Then $\\frac{2(x)+0}{2} = \\frac{x-1}{2}$.  This works. $2(1)x + 0 / 2 = x-1/2$. $a+b+c = 1+0+2=3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
