        "ground_truth": "In the subtraction problem, we can start by looking at the left column. The first possible case is that $A-B=0$, so that $A=B$. However, if $A=B$, that does not work in the right column, since $B-A$ would equal 0 and not 3. So, we have to go with the second possibility for the left column, in which the right column borrowed from the left column and we're left with $(A-1)-B=0$. This tells us that $A-1=B$, so the nonnegative difference of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nNote that we are unable to solve for the actual digits $A$ and $B$ even if we consider the units digit. Now that we know the right column borrows from the left column, we get that $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & & 1 & B_4\\\\ &- & & & & A_4\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & & & & 3_4.\\\\ \\end{array} $$This also means $A+3=1B_4=4+B$, which is the same as $A-1=B$. We can't solve for $A$ and $B$ because any digits that satisfy $A-1=B$ will work, such as $A=3, B=2$ or $A=2, B=1$."

        "inference": "The problem states that we are given a difference of two base-4 numbers, $A \\cdot 4^1 + B \\cdot 4^0$ and $B \\cdot 4^1 + A \\cdot 4^0$, which equals $3$.  This is expressed as $AB_4 - BA_4 = 3$. The problem asks for the nonnegative difference between $A$ and $B$, i.e. $|A-B|$.\n\nWe have $AB_4 - BA_4 = (4A+B) - (4B+A) = 3A - 3B = 3$, which simplifies to $A-B = 1$.\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are digits in base 4, they can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Thus, the pairs $(A, B)$ satisfying $A - B = 1$ are (1,0), (2,1), (3,2).  The possible differences are $|1-0|=1$, $|2-1|=1$, $|3-2|=1$.  Since all the possible pairs of (A,B) result in $|A-B|=1$, the answer is 1.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$\n",
