        "inference": "The problem states that $A+B = 10_7$ in base 7.  This means $A+B = 7(1) + 3 = 10$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are digits in base 7, they must be integers from 0 to 6.\n\nThe possible pairs $(A, B)$ that sum to 10 are $(3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1)$.  However, only 3, 4, 5, 6 are valid digits in base 7.\n\nThus, the possible pairs that sum to 10 are $(3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4)$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are in base 7, the pairs of values are $(3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4)$.  \nOnly $(3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4)$ are possible pairs.\n\nBut in base 7, the values of $A$ and $B$ are between 0 and 6.  Thus, 7 is an invalid value.\n\nThe possible pairs are (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4)\nBut since we are working in base 7, we can't have 7, so the possible pairs that sum to 10 are (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4).\nThe only valid one in base 7 is (3, 7).\n\n(3, 7) is invalid\n(4, 6) is valid, gives 46_7\n(5, 5) is valid, gives 55_7\n(6, 4) is valid, gives 64_7\nThe only possible solutions are 46_7, 55_7, 64_7.\n\nConsider $A+B = 10_7 \\implies A+B=10$.\nPairs are (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4).  But $A$ and $B$ must be between 0 and 6, so only (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4).\nThe problem seems to have an ambiguity.\n\nThe given equation seems to be incorrectly expressed. The problem likely means to find A such that A+B = 10 in base 7.  \nThis means A+B = 3 mod 7.\nThe problem might have intended the question to be $A+B = 10$ in base 7, which equals 10 in base 10.  This means $A+B=10$,\nIf A = 3, B = 7. But B cannot be 7 since it is a base 7 digit.  \n\nIf $A+B=10_7=3$ mod 7.\nIf $A=2, B=1$, $A+B=3$.\nThus $A=2$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
