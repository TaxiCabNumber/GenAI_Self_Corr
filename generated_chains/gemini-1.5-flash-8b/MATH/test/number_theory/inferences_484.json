        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYour friend has over 200 stamps. He has a stamp book where he can put 30 stamps on each page. He has placed the stamps in his stamp book in such a way that the only page which is not completely filled with stamps is the last one. The last page has 5 stamps in it. What is the smallest number of stamps your friend can have?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of pages in the stamp book.\nEach page can hold 30 stamps.\nThe last page has 5 stamps.\nThe total number of stamps is $30(n-1) + 5 = 30n - 30 + 5 = 30n - 25$.\nThe total number of stamps is over 200.\n$30n - 25 > 200$\n$30n > 225$\n$n > \\frac{225}{30} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5$\nSince $n$ is an integer, $n \\ge 8$.\nThe smallest integer value of $n$ is 8.\nThe total number of stamps is $30(8-1) + 5 = 30(7) + 5 = 210 + 5 = 215$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{215}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "An integer equivalent to 5 mod 30 can be written in the form $30k + 5$. In this situation, $30k+5$ represents the number of stamps your friend has, while $k$ represents the number of filled pages he has. We want to solve the inequality $30k+5 > 200$. This inequality has solution $k > 6\\frac{1}{2}$. Since $k$ represents the number of filled pages, $k$ must be an integer. The smallest integer greater than $6\\frac{1}{2}$ is $7$, so your friend has $30(7) + 5 = \\boxed{215}$ stamps."
