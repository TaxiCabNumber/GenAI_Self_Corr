At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then what remainder does $2n+1$ give when divided by 7?",
        "inference": "Since $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we can write $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $2n + 1 = 2(7k + 3) + 1 = 14k + 6 + 1 = 14k + 7$.\nWe can write $14k + 7 = 7(2k + 1)$.\nSince $2k + 1$ is an integer, $14k + 7$ is divisible by 7. This means that $2n + 1$ gives a remainder of 0 when divided by 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$."
