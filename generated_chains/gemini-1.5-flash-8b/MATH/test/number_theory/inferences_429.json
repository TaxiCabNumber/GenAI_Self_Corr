At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$?",
        "inference": "To find the largest three-digit number with a digit product of 12, we need to consider three-digit numbers. The largest possible three-digit numbers are those with the largest digits in decreasing order.\nWe are looking for the largest three-digit number where the product of the digits is 12.\nPossible sets of three digits whose product is 12 are:\n1, 2, 6\n1, 3, 4\n2, 2, 3\nThe largest possible three-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 6 is 621.\nThe largest possible three-digit number using the digits 1, 3, 4 is 431.\nThe largest possible three-digit number using the digits 2, 2, 3 is 322.\nComparing these numbers, we find that 621 is the largest.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{621}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$."
