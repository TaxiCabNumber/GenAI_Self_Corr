I hope it is correct.'\nA bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
        "inference": "Let $W$ be the event that a white ball is drawn, and $B$ be the event that a black ball is drawn.\nThe probability of drawing a white ball is $P(W) = \\frac{5}{5+k}$.\nThe probability of drawing a black ball is $P(B) = \\frac{k}{5+k}$.\nThe player wins 1 dollar if a white ball is drawn, and loses 1 dollar if a black ball is drawn.\nThe expected value of the game is given by $E = (1)P(W) + (-1)P(B) = \\frac{5}{5+k} - \\frac{k}{5+k} = \\frac{5-k}{5+k}$.\nThe expected loss is 50 cents, which is 0.5 dollars.\nSo, $\\frac{5-k}{5+k} = -0.5$.\nMultiplying both sides by $5+k$, we get $5-k = -0.5(5+k) = -2.5 - 0.5k$.\n$5-k = -2.5-0.5k$\n$5+2.5 = k-0.5k$\n$7.5 = 0.5k$\n$k = \\frac{7.5}{0.5} = \\frac{75}{5} = 15$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \\[ E = \\frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \\frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}. \\] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\\boxed{k = 15}$."
