        "inference": "1. We have 2 green balls and 2 red balls.\n2. We want to distribute these 4 balls into 3 distinguishable boxes.\n3. This is a stars and bars problem.\n4. The total number of ways to distribute n identical items into k distinguishable boxes is given by the formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$.\n\n5. We can represent the number of balls in each box using stars and bars. For example, if we put 1 green ball and 1 red ball in box 1, 1 green ball in box 2 and 0 red balls in box 2, and 0 green balls and 1 red ball in box 3, we can represent it as:\n   G1, R1 | G1, R0 | G0, R1\n\n6. First, we treat the green balls as identical and the red balls as identical.\n7. We have 2 green balls and 2 red balls.\n8. For the 2 green balls, we have the possible configurations of 3 boxes:\n   - (2,0,0)\n   - (1,1,0)\n   - (1,0,1)\n   - (0,2,0)\n   - (0,1,1)\n   - (0,0,2)\n   These are just the ways to distribute the 2 green balls.\n   \n9. Using the stars and bars method, for 2 green balls into 3 boxes, the number of ways is $\\binom{2+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n10. Similarly, for 2 red balls into 3 boxes, the number of ways is $\\binom{2+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n11. Since we have 2 green and 2 red balls, we need to multiply the number of ways to distribute the green balls by the number of ways to distribute the red balls to find the total number of ways to distribute both.\n12. The total number of ways to distribute the green balls and the red balls is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n13. Now, we consider the indistinguishable balls. We can have 2 green balls and 2 red balls. \n   Case 1: One box has both red and green balls. 2 different ways to pick which boxes. $\\binom{3}{1}$\n   Case 2: Three different boxes. 3! / 2! 2! = 3 possibilities\n\n14. The total number of ways to distribute the 2 green and 2 red balls in 3 boxes is 18\n\n15. Applying the multinomial coefficient method gives:\n  $\\binom{4}{2,1,1} \\times 3 = 6 \\times 3 = 18$\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$",
        "ground_truth": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls."
