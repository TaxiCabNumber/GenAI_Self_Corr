At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
        "inference": "For each cube, there are 3 red faces and 3 white faces.  When the cube lands, there are 6 possible outcomes.  The probability of any one face showing is 1/6.\nFor one cube, the number of ways to have one red face and one white face is 3 ways to choose the red face and 3 ways to choose the white face, for a total of 9 outcomes.  However, we need to consider order. So there are 3 red and 3 white faces.  The total ways for one cube to have 1 red and 1 white face is 3*3=9. However, the order matters, so there are 6 possible outcomes for each cube (RRRWWR).\nFor each cube, the possible outcomes for one red face and one white face are: R-W, W-R.\nThe probability of getting one red face and one white face on a single cube is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36. But this counts the order, so we have 2 outcomes (R-W, W-R). The probability of getting one red and one white face on one cube is (3*3)/6/6 = 9/36 = 1/4. The favorable outcomes are 2.\nFor two cubes, there are 2 favorable outcomes for each cube.  Thus there are 2*2=4 possible combinations for one red face up and one white face up on both cubes:  (R-W on first cube and R-W on second cube), (R-W on first cube and W-R on second cube), (W-R on first cube and R-W on second cube), and (W-R on first cube and W-R on second cube).\nProbability of one cube landing with 1 red face and 1 white face = (3/6)*(3/6) = 1/4.\nSince there are 2 favorable outcomes (R-W, W-R) for each cube, and the cubes are independent, the probability that both cubes land with 1 red face and 1 white face is\n(1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n2 ways to choose 1 red, 1 white\nProbability for each cube is (2 ways to choose)/(6 ways total) = 2/6=1/3.\nThere are 2 ways for each cube.  Probability for one cube is (2 ways)/(6 faces)= 2/6 = 1/3\nProbability for both cubes = (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9\nProbability for each cube is (1 red, 1 white) = (3/6)*(3/6)=1/4\nFor the two cubes, there are 4 possibilities: RR, RW, WR, WW. The possible outcomes are RW, WR.  There are 2 outcomes.\nP(one cube) = (1/4)\nP(both cubes) = (1/4)^2\nThe possible outcomes are (R, W) or (W, R) for each cube.  So there are 2 choices for the first cube and 2 choices for the second cube. The probability for one cube is 2/6 * 2/6 = 2*2/6*6 = 4/36 = 1/9. The probability for one cube is 2/6*1 = 1/3\nSo the probability is 4/36 = 1/9\nThe probability for one cube is (3 choose 1)*(3 choose 1) / 6 * 6 = 9/36 = 1/4.\nThe favorable outcomes are RW, WR. P(RW or WR) = 2/6=1/3.  P(RW, WR) = (1/3)^2=1/9\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/9}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
