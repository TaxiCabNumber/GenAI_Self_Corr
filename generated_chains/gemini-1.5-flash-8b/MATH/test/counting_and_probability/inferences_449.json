At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of three Republicans?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members from 13 members (5 Republicans + 6 Democrats + 2 Independents) is given by the combination formula:  \n   $\\binom{13}{3} = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13!}{3!10!} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 13 \\times 2 \\times 11 = 286$.\n\n2. Number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 5 Republicans is given by the combination formula:\n   $\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n3. The probability of choosing a subcommittee of 3 Republicans is the ratio of the number of ways to choose 3 Republicans to the total number of ways to choose any subcommittee of 3 members:\n   $P(\\text{3 Republicans}) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{3}}{\\binom{13}{3}} = \\frac{10}{286}$.\n\n4. Simplify the fraction:\n   $\\frac{10}{286} = \\frac{5}{143}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{143}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{13}{3} = 286$ ways to choose a subcommittee from the committee, and $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose a subcommittee of all Republicans.  The chance that a random subcommittee is all Republican is $\\dfrac{10}{286} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{143}}$."
