At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSarah wants to order a pizza with 2 different toppings. She has 9 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could she order?",
        "inference": "Sarah has 9 choices for the first topping.\nAfter choosing the first topping, she has 8 choices left for the second topping.\nThe total number of different pizzas she can order is the product of the number of choices for each topping.\nTotal pizzas = 9 * 8 = 72\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 9 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of a 9-element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${9 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{36}$ to compute this."
