At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTara rolls three standard dice once.  What is the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled will be three or more?  Express your answer as a percent.",
        "inference": "The possible outcomes when rolling three standard dice are the integers from 3 to 18.\nThe possible sums range from 3 to 18.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$.\nThe sums that are 3 or more are all possible sums from 3 to 18.\nSince there are no sums less than 3, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of outcomes where the sum is from 3 to 18, which is all possible outcomes.\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 216.\nThe probability is $\\frac{216}{216} = 1$.\n1 = 100%\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$% I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest possible number that Tara can roll is a 3, by getting a 1 on each die. Thus, she will always get a sum of three or more. Our answer is $\\boxed{100\\%}$."
