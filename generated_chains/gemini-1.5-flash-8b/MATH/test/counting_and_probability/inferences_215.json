At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob and Alice each have a bag that contains one ball of each of the colors,  blue, green, orange, red, and violet. Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. Bob then randomly selects one ball from his bag and  puts it into Alice's bag. What is the probability that after this process the contents of the two bags are the same?",
        "inference": "Let $B$ denote the colors in Bob's bag, and $A$ denote the colors in Alice's bag.\nInitially, both bags contain one ball of each color: $\\{B=\\{blue, green, orange, red, violet\\}\\}$ and $A = B$.\nAlice selects a ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag.\nBob then selects a ball from his bag and puts it into Alice's bag.\nThe total number of ways to choose the balls is $5 \\times 5 = 25$.\nThe bags are the same if the balls in each bag are the same set of colors.\nInitially, $A=B$.\nCase 1: Alice picks a ball and Bob picks the same ball.\nAlice picks $blue$. Bob picks $blue$. The balls are still the same.\nAlice picks $blue$. Bob picks $green$. Then $A = \\{green, \\dots\\}$. $B = \\{blue, \\dots\\}$.\nCase 2: Alice picks a ball and Bob picks a different ball.\nAlice picks $blue$. Bob picks $green$.\nAlice's bag: $A = \\{blue, green, orange, red, violet\\} - \\{blue\\} = \\{green, orange, red, violet\\}$.\nBob's bag: $B = \\{blue, green, orange, red, violet\\} + \\{blue\\} = \\{blue, green, orange, red, violet, blue\\}$.\nWe want to find the probability that the bags are the same after the process.\nThe contents of the bags are the same if after the process, they both have one ball of each color.\nThe only way the contents are the same is if Alice chooses a ball, and Bob chooses the same ball back to Alice's bag.\nThis means Alice picks a ball and Bob picks the same ball back to Alice. This is one of the 5 possibilities.\nThe probability that Bob picks the ball that Alice picked is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\nThe number of ways to choose a color for Alice is 5.\nThe number of ways to choose a color for Bob is 5.\nIf the process changes the bag contents, then the bag contents cannot be the same.\nIf the bag contents are the same, then the balls swapped must be the same color.\nAlice picks a color, say $c_1$. Bob picks the same color $c_1$.\nAlice now has the set $A = \\{blue, green, orange, red, violet\\} \\setminus \\{c_1\\} = \\{c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$.\nBob has the set $B = \\{blue, green, orange, red, violet\\} \\cup \\{c_1\\} = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$.\nIf Alice picks color $x$ and Bob picks color $x$, the contents are the same.\nThere are 5 possible choices for Alice.\nThe probability is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/5}$",
        "ground_truth": "After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
