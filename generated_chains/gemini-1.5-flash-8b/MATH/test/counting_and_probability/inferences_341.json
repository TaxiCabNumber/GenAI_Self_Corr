At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
        "inference": "Let P be the set of slices with pepperoni, and M be the set of slices with mushrooms.\nWe are given that the total number of slices is 12.\n|P| = 5\n|M| = 8\nEach slice has at least one topping, so the number of slices with at least one topping is 12.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of slices with at least one topping is given by:\n|P \u222a M| = |P| + |M| - |P \u2229 M|\n12 = 5 + 8 - |P \u2229 M|\n12 = 13 - |P \u2229 M|\n|P \u2229 M| = 13 - 12\n|P \u2229 M| = 1\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$."
