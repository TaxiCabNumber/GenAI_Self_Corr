At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can the letters of the word BANANA be rearranged such that the new word does not begin with a B?",
        "inference": "1. Total arrangements of BANANA:\n   The letters in BANANA are B, A, N, A, N, A. There are 6 letters in total.\n   The letters are B (1), A (3), N (2).\n   The number of arrangements is $\\frac{6!}{1!3!2!} = \\frac{720}{1 \\times 6 \\times 2} = \\frac{720}{12} = 60$.\n\n2. Arrangements starting with B:\n   If the first letter is B, we are left with 5 letters (A, N, A, N, A).\n   The arrangements are $\\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10$.\n\n3. Arrangements not starting with B:\n   The number of arrangements that do not start with B is the total arrangements minus the arrangements starting with B:\n   $60 - 10 = 50$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first thing to do is place the B since it has a restriction on it. We can put it anywhere but the first place, so we have 5 options. Once we have done that, we just need to place the two N's and then the rest of the spots will just be A's. We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N. However, the two N's are identical, which means that we've counted each new word twice. So our answer is $\\frac{5\\times5\\times4}{2}=\\boxed{50}$."
