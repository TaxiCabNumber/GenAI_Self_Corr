At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if we have no restrictions other than the same person can't hold both offices?",

There are 20 choices.\nAfter choosing the president, we need to choose the vice-president. Since the same person cannot hold both offices, there are now 19 choices for the vice-president.\nSo the total number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president is $20 \\times 19 = 380$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{380}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
