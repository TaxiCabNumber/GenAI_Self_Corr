I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. Treat each party as a single block.  We have 3 blocks (Democrats, Republicans, Independent). The number of ways to arrange 3 distinct objects in a circle is (3-1)! = 2!.\n2. Within each party block, there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The number of ways to arrange the members within each party block in a row is 5! for Democrats and Republicans, and 1! for the Independent. So, the number of ways to arrange each party block in a row is 5! * 5! * 1! = (120)(120)(1) = 14400\n3. Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks in a circle by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block: 2! * 14400 = 2 * 14400 = 28800.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28800}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$."

The correct formula for arranging n distinct objects in a circle is (n-1)!.  Here, n=3, so the number of ways to arrange the blocks in a circle is (3-1)! = 2!.
