        "inference": "Let $X$ be the number of heads in 5 coin flips.\nThe probability of getting a head in a single flip is $p = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nThe probability of getting a tail in a single flip is $q = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nWe are looking for the probability of getting exactly 2 heads in 5 flips. This is a binomial probability problem.\nThe probability of getting exactly $k$ heads in $n$ flips is given by the binomial probability formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$$\nIn this case, $n = 5$, $k = 2$, $p = \\frac{2}{3}$, and $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n$$P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{5-2}$$\n$$P(X=2) = \\binom{5}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3$$\n$$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$$\n$$P(X=2) = 10 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{27} = 10 \\times \\frac{4}{243} = \\frac{40}{243}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{40}{243}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method."
