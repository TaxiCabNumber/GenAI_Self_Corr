I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they are not all the same color?",
        "inference": "1. The total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52 is $\\binom{52}{3} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100$.\n\n2. The number of ways to choose 3 cards of the same color (all red or all black) is the sum of the number of ways to choose 3 red cards and 3 black cards.\n   - There are 26 red cards and 26 black cards.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 red cards is $\\binom{26}{3} = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2600$.\n   - The number of ways to choose 3 black cards is $\\binom{26}{3} = 2600$.\n   - So the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of the same color is $2600 + 2600 = 5200$.\n\n3. The number of ways to choose 3 cards that are not all the same color is the total number of ways to choose 3 cards minus the number of ways to choose 3 cards of the same color.\n   - $22100 - 5200 = 16900$.\n\n4. The probability of choosing 3 cards that are not all the same color is $\\frac{16900}{22100} = \\frac{16900 \\div 100}{22100 \\div 100} = \\frac{169}{221}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{169}{221}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]"
