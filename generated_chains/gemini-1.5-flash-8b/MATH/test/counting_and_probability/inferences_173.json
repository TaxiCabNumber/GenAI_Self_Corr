At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to assign each of 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class if one of these six, Manoj, refuses to be in a class without any of his friends?",
        "inference": "1. If Manoj is in the chemistry class, then all his friends must also be in the chemistry class. This leaves 5 friends, who each can be in either chemistry or biology.  There are $2^5$ ways to assign these 5 friends.\n2. If Manoj is in the biology class, then all his friends must also be in the biology class.  This leaves 5 friends, who each can be in either chemistry or biology. There are $2^5$ ways to assign these 5 friends.\n3. The total number of ways to assign the 6 friends is the sum of the ways in case 1 and case 2.\n4.  So the total number of ways is $2^5 + 2^5 = 2 \\times 2^5 = 2^6 = 64$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For each friend, there are 2 choices for which class to place them in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 6 friends, we multiply the number of choices together. Hence there are $2^6 = 64$ ways to split the friends into two classes. However, 2 of those 64 arrangements are invalid: we can't put Manoj in chemistry and everyone else in biology, and we can't put Manoj in biology and everyone else in chemistry. So our final answer is $64-2=\\boxed{62}$."
