At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn international meeting is held between England, Germany, and France.  Three representatives attend from England, four from Germany, and two from France.  How many ways can all nine representatives sit around a circular table, if representatives of the same country sit together?  (Two ways are considered the same if one can be rotated to produce the other.)",
        "inference": "1. First, consider the number of ways the three English representatives can sit together.  Treat them as a single block.\n2. Similarly, treat the four German and two French representatives as single blocks.\n3. The three blocks (England, Germany, France) can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways around the circular table.\n4. Within each block, the representatives can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways for England, 4! = 24 ways for Germany, and 2! = 2 ways for France.\n5. Multiply the number of arrangements of the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the representatives within each block: 6 * 6 * 24 * 2 = 1728\n6. The number of ways the 9 representatives can sit around a circular table with the condition that the representatives of the same country sit together is 1728.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "To begin, consider the number of ways to arrange the three countries around the circle.  We can consider the English representatives a block, the Germans another block, and the French a third block.  There are $(3-1)!=2$ ways to arrange these three blocks around a circle.  We can also see this by simply drawing the two possible arrangements: [asy]\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0));\nlabel(\"F\",(-.75,-1));\nlabel(\"G\",(.75,-1));\nlabel(\"E\",(3,0));\nlabel(\"F\",(3.75,-1));\nlabel(\"G\",(2.25,-1));\n[/asy] Within the English group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the three representatives.  Similarly, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Germans and $2!$ ways to arrange the French representatives.  Overall, the total number of ways to seat the 9 representatives is: $$2!\\times3!\\times4!\\times2!=2\\times6\\times24\\times2=\\boxed{576}$$"
