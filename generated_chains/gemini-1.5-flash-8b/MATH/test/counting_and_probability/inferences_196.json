In this case, the side lengths are $x$, $y$, and $1$. Thus we have the conditions:\n1) $x + y > 1$\n2) $x + 1 > y$\n3) $y + 1 > x$\nWe are looking for the obtuse triangle.  The triangle is obtuse if one angle is greater than 90 degrees.  This occurs when the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.  Consider the case where $x \\le y \\le 1$.\nThe triangle inequality gives us $x+y > 1$, $x+1 > y$, and $y+1 > x$.  The condition for an obtuse triangle is that $1^2 > x^2+y^2$ (for sides x and y), or $1^2 > x^2+y^2$ (for sides 1 and x) or $1^2 > x^2+y^2$ (for sides 1 and y).  This reduces to $1 > x^2 + y^2$.\nThe area of the region where $x+y>1$, $x+1>y$, and $y+1>x$ is the region inside the triangle with vertices (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).

The intersection of this circle with the triangle described above is the area where the triangle is obtuse. The area where the triangle is obtuse is given by the intersection of $x+y > 1$, $x+1 > y$, $y+1 > x$, and $x^2+y^2 < 1$.\nThe triangle inequality implies that $x+y > 1$, $x+1 > y$, $y+1 > x$. The region is a triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). The area of this triangle is 1/2. The region $x^2 + y^2 < 1$ is the unit circle centered at (0,0). The intersection of the triangle and the circle is the region where an obtuse triangle is formed. This area can be calculated.\nThe area of the region where $x+y > 1$ is a triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) which has area 1/2.
