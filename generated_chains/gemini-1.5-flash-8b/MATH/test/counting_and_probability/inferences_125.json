At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class. In how many ways can he pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow? (The order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter.)",
        "inference": "1. Number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 boys:  $\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$\n2. Number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4 girls: $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$\n3. To find the total number of ways to choose the group, multiply the number of ways to choose the boys and the number of ways to choose the girls: $35 \\times 6 = 210$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{210}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 ways to pick the first girl and 3 ways to pick the second one; however, this counts each pair of girls twice since selecting girl A followed by girl B is the same as selecting girl B followed by girl A, so the total number of ways to pick the girls is $\\frac{4\\times3}{2}=6$. Similarly, there are 7 ways to pick the first boy, 6 ways to pick the second one, and 5 ways to pick the last one, but this counts each combination of boys 6 times since picking any of the three boys first followed by either of the other two followed by the third one will give the same triplet of boys. So the total number of ways to pick the boys is $\\frac{7\\times6\\times5}{3\\times2}=35$, and the total of number of ways to pick the students for the group presentation is $\\frac{4\\times3}{2}\\cdot \\frac{7\\times6\\times5}{3\\times2}=\\boxed{210}$"
