At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA senate committee has 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.  In how many ways can the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs, such that all 4 Democrats sit together?",
        "inference": "1. Treat the 4 Democrats as a single block.  Then we have 5 Republicans and 1 block of Democrats, a total of 6 entities.\n2. These 6 entities can be arranged in 6! ways.\n3. The 4 Democrats within their block can be arranged in 4! ways.\n4. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6! * 4!.\n5. 6! = 720 and 4! = 24.\n6. 720 * 24 = 17280\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17280}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$."
