        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.  (For example, if I draw the $8\\clubsuit$, then I win 16 dollars.)  What would be a fair price to pay to play the game?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nYour answer should be a number with two digits after the decimal point, like $21.43$.",
