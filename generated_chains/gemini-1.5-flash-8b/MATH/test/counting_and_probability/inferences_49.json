        "ground_truth": "If the lower cells contain $A$, $B$ and $C$, then the second row will contain $A + B$ and $B + C$, and the top cell will contain $A + 2B+C$. To obtain the smallest sum, place 1  in the center cell and 2 and 3 in the outer ones. The top number will be 7. For the largest sum, place 9 in the center cell and 7 and 8 in the outer ones.
