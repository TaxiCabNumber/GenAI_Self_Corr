        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\" can I form?",
        "inference": "The word \"Hawaii\" has 6 letters.\nThe letters are H, A, W, A, I, I.\nThere are 2 A's and 2 I's.\nThe total number of arrangements of 6 letters is 6! = 720.\nHowever, since there are 2 A's and 2 I's, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the repeated letters.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 2 A's is 2! = 2.\nThe number of ways to arrange the 2 I's is 2! = 2.\nSo we divide by 2! * 2! = 4.\nThe number of distinct six-letter rearrangements of \"Hawaii\" is 6! / (2! * 2!) = 720 / 4 = 180.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If every letter of ``Hawaii\" were different, there would be $6! = 6\\cdot 5 \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii\" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\\frac{6!}{2\\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 30 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{180}$."
