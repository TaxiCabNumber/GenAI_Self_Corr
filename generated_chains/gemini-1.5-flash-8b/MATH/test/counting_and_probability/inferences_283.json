At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we form an international commission if we must choose one European country from among 6 European countries, one Asian country from among 4, one North American country from among 3, and one African country from among 7?",
        "inference": "To form an international commission, we need to choose one country from each of the four continents.\nThe number of ways to choose one European country from 6 is 6.\nThe number of ways to choose one Asian country from 4 is 4.\nThe number of ways to choose one North American country from 3 is 3.\nThe number of ways to choose one African country from 7 is 7.\nTo find the total number of ways to form the commission, we multiply the number of choices for each continent.\nTotal ways = (Number of European countries) \u00d7 (Number of Asian countries) \u00d7 (Number of North American countries) \u00d7 (Number of African countries)\nTotal ways = 6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 504\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{504}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are six ways in which one European country can be chosen, four in which one Asian country can be chosen, three in which one North American country can be chosen, and seven in which one African country can be chosen. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{504}$ ways to form the international commission."
