At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 8 pens along a wall in the pound.  The pound has to allocate 4 pens to dogs, 3 to cats, and one to roosters.  In how many ways can the pound make the allocation?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to choose 4 pens out of 8 for the dogs. This can be done in $\\binom{8}{4}$ ways.\n2. Then, we need to choose 3 pens out of the remaining 4 pens for the cats. This can be done in $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways.\n3. Finally, the remaining 1 pen will be for the roosters.\n\nThus, the total number of ways is $\\binom{8}{4} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{1}{1} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} \\times \\frac{4!}{3!1!} \\times 1 = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} \\times \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1} \\times 1 = 70 \\times 4 \\times 1 = 280$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{280}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $8!$ ways to arrange 8 allocations to the pens if they are not identical, but we must divide by $4!$ for the four dog pen allocations and divide by $3!$ for the three cat pen allocations.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4! \\times 3!} = \\boxed{280}$."
