        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are four red balls and two white balls in a jar. One ball is randomly removed and replaced with a ball of the opposite color. The jar is then shaken and one ball is randomly selected. What is the probability that this ball is red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "1. Initially, there are 4 red balls and 2 white balls, for a total of 6 balls. The probability of drawing a red ball is 4/6 = 2/3, and the probability of drawing a white ball is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n2. If a red ball is removed, it is replaced with a white ball. Now there are 3 red balls and 3 white balls. The probability of drawing a red ball in this case is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n3. If a white ball is removed, it is replaced with a red ball. Now there are 5 red balls and 1 white ball. The probability of drawing a red ball in this case is 5/6.\n\n4. To find the overall probability of drawing a red ball, we need to consider both possibilities (removing a red ball or a white ball).\n   - Probability of removing a red ball and then drawing a red ball: (4/6) * (3/6) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n   - Probability of removing a white ball and then drawing a red ball: (2/6) * (5/6) = (1/3) * (5/6) = 5/18\n\n5. The overall probability of drawing a red ball is the sum of these probabilities: 1/3 + 5/18 = 6/18 + 5/18 = 11/18\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{18}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
