        "inference": "Let A be at 0, B be at 4, and C be at 6.  The dart lands between A and C, so $0 \\le x \\le 6$.  The dart is closer to B than to A if $|x-4| < |x-0|$, which simplifies to $(x-4)^2 < x^2$, leading to $x > 2$.  The dart is closer to B than to C if $|x-4| < |x-6|$, which simplifies to $(x-4)^2 < (x-6)^2$, leading to $x < 5$.  Combining these conditions, we have $2 < x < 5$. Since the total length of the interval from A to C is 6, the length of the interval satisfying both conditions is 3.
