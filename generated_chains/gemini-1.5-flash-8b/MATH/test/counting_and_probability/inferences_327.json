I hope it is correct.'\nOn the game board below Kendra will start at the center of the board. For each turn she will spin this spinner with four congruent sectors once, and then she will move one space in the direction indicated on the spinner. The \"Start'' square does not have a numerical value, but Kendra may land on it during her turns. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers in the spaces on which she will land will be exactly 30 after her third complete turn?
