I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Cole needs to select 3 girls and 5 boys to go on a backpacking trip. In how many ways can he do this if 6 girls and 11 boys are interested in going on the trip?",
        "inference": "To select 3 girls from 6, the number of ways is $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\nTo select 5 boys from 11, the number of ways is $\\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11!}{5!(11-5)!} = \\frac{11!}{5!6!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 11 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 462$.\nTo find the total number of ways to select 3 girls and 5 boys, we multiply the number of ways to select the girls by the number of ways to select the boys:\n$20 \\times 462 = 9240$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9240}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \\binom{6}{3}\\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \\boxed{9,\\!240}. $$"
