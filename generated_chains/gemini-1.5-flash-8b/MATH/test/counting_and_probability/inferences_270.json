At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
        "inference": "The divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\nThe composite divisors are 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\nThere are 9 composite divisors.\nWe want to count the number of subsets of the set of composite divisors of 72.\nThe number of subsets of a set with n elements is $2^n$.\nIn this case, n=9, so the number of subsets is $2^9$.\n$2^9 = 512$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{512}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors."
