At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam rolled two standard six-sided dice once.  What is the probability that he did not roll a prime number on either die? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The prime numbers on a standard six-sided die are 2, 3, and 5.  There are 3 prime numbers.\nThe numbers on a standard six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  There are 6 total numbers.\nThe probability of rolling a prime number on a single die is 3/6 = 1/2.\nThe probability of not rolling a prime number on a single die is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nThe probability of not rolling a prime number on both dice is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The prime numbers from 1 to 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on any one die is equal to $\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$, since there is an equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6. Since the two dice are independent, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on either die is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
