At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?",
        "inference": "1. Helen + Ines + Janet + Kendra + Lara = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13 games won.\n\n2. Total possible games:  (6 players choose 2) = 6!/(2!4!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15 games.\n\n3. Games won by Monica = Total games - games won by others = 15 - 13 = 2 games.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the six players played 5 games, and each game involved two players. So there were $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games. Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra and Lara won a total of $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games, so Monica won $15-13=\\boxed{2}$ games."
