At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA blue plane, a red plane and a white plane are waiting to take off from an airport that has two runways. Planes must take off from the airport one at a time, but can take off from either runway. In how many ways can the three takeoffs be scheduled? (One such way is the blue plane on runway A, followed by the red plane on runway B, followed by the white plane on runway B.)",
        "inference": "The first plane can take off from either runway A or runway B.\nSo there are 2 choices for the first plane.\nThe second plane can take off from either runway A or runway B.\nSo there are 2 choices for the second plane.\nThe third plane can take off from either runway A or runway B.\nSo there are 2 choices for the third plane.\nThe total number of ways to schedule the three takeoffs is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 ways to choose the first plane and 2 ways to choose where it takes off. Similarly, there are 2 ways to choose the second plane after the first has taken off and 2 ways to choose where it takes off, as well as 1 way to choose the last plane and 2 ways to choose its runway. These multiply to a total of $3\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot1\\cdot2=3\\cdot2^4=\\boxed{48}$."

        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of planes.\nFor each plane, there are 2 runways to choose from.\nSince the runways are distinct, the total number of ways to schedule the takeoffs of $n$ planes is $2^n$.\nIn this case, $n=3$, so the total number of ways to schedule the takeoffs is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$",
