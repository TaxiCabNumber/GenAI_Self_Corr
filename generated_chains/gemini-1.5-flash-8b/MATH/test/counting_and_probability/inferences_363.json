At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The set is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThere are $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$ possible pairs.\nThe pairs are $(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)$.\nThe products are $2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$.\nThe even products are $2, 4, 6, 8, 12$.\nThere are 4 even products.\nThe probability of selecting an even product is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$."
