        "inference": "The sample space is a square with vertices (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), and (0,2). The area of the square is $2^2 = 4$. The region defined by $x^2+y^2 \\le 4$ is a circle with center (0,0) and radius 2.  The area of this circle is $\\pi(2^2) = 4\\pi$. The region of interest is the intersection of the square and the circle.  Since the circle is entirely contained within the square, the area of the region where $x^2+y^2 \\le 4$ within the square is simply $4\\pi$.  The probability is the ratio of the area of the part of the circle within the square to the area of the square. The part of the circle within the square is $4\\pi$ and the total area of the square is 4.  So, the probability is $\\frac{4\\pi}{4} = \\pi$. However, the circle is completely within the square. The portion of the circle inside the square is the area of the quarter circle in the first quadrant ($4\\pi/4 = \\pi$), and the probability is the area of the quarter circle in the first quadrant divided by the total area of the square.\nThe portion of the circle in the first quadrant is $\\pi 2^2 / 4 = \\pi$. The correct calculation of the area is the area of the quarter circle in the first quadrant divided by the total area of the sample space. $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (2^2) / 4 = \\pi/4$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\pi/4}$",
