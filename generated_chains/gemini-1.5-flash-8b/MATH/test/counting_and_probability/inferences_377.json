        "ground_truth": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.
