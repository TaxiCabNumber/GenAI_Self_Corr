At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA school organization consists of 5 teachers, 7 parents and 6 students. A subcommittee of this group is formed by choosing 2 teachers, 3 parents and 3 students. How many different subcommittees can be formed?",
        "inference": "1. Number of ways to choose 2 teachers from 5 teachers: $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\n2. Number of ways to choose 3 parents from 7 parents: $\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35$.\n3. Number of ways to choose 3 students from 6 students: $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$.\n4. To find the total number of different subcommittees, multiply the results from steps 1, 2, and 3: $10 \\times 35 \\times 20 = 7000$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7000}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$."
