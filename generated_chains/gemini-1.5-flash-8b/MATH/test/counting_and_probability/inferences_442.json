At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA PE class has 12 students, 6 girls and 6 boys. The coach has 4 jerseys in each of 3 colors to mark 3 teams for a soccer tournament. If the coach wants at least one girl and at least one boy on each team, how many ways can he give out the jerseys? (Jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "1. We need to distribute the 12 students into 3 teams with at least one girl and one boy on each team.  There are $\\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{1}\\binom{6}{1}\\times 3!$.\n2. Number of ways to select 1 girl from 6, 1 boy from 6 for each team is $\\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$\n3. Now we have 3 teams, so the arrangement of the teams matters.  This is a permutation, so there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the teams.\n4. The total number of ways to assign the jerseys is $216 \\times 6 = 1296$.\n5. We have 4 jerseys of 3 colors.  The jerseys are indistinguishable within the same color.  Thus, this is a problem in distributing 12 balls into 3 bins with each bin containing at least 1 ball.\n\nWe have $\\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 216$. Then we can arrange 3 teams in 3! ways.\nThis means $216 \\times 6 = 1296$ is the number of ways to assign the 3 teams with the constraints.\n6. Since the jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable, this doesn't change the number of ways to assign the jerseys.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1296}$\n",

We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot15\\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys. Subtracting this from the total, we get $34650-4950=\\boxed{29700}$ ways for the coach to assign the teams."
