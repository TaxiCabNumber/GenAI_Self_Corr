At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many unique diagonals can be drawn in a five-sided convex polygon?",
        "inference": "A five-sided convex polygon is a pentagon.\nTo find the number of diagonals, we can use the formula for the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon:\nNumber of diagonals = $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$\nIn this case, n = 5, so\nNumber of diagonals = $\\frac{5(5-3)}{2} = \\frac{5(2)}{2} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of vertices.  Five of these pairs correspond to adjacent vertices, which when connected yield edges of the pentagon.  Connecting any one of the $10-5=\\boxed{5}$ remaining pairs of vertices yields a diagonal."
