At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the elements of the $n$th row (i.e. the row with $n+1$ elements) of Pascal's triangle minus the sum of all the elements from previous rows. For example, \\[f(2) = \\underbrace{(1 + 2 + 1)}_{\\text{2nd row}} - \\underbrace{(1 + 1 + 1)}_{\\text{0th and 1st rows}} = 1. \\]What is the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$?",
        "inference": "The $n$th row of Pascal's triangle corresponds to the binomial coefficients $\\binom{n}{k}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n$. The sum of the elements in the $n$th row is $2^n$. The sum of the elements in the first $n$ rows is $2^n-1$.\nThus, $f(n) = 2^n - (2^n-1) = 1$.\nSince $f(n) = 1$ for all $n$, the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$ is 1.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.",

The sum of the elements of the $m$th row is simply \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{i} = \\sum_{i=0}^m \\binom{m}{i}1^i = (1+1)^m=2^m\\] by the binomial theorem. Thus the sum of the elements of the $k$th row, for $k \\le n$, is $2^k$, so the total sum of all the elements of the previous rows is \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \\frac{2^n-1}{2-1} = 2^n-1\\] by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, $f(n)=2^n-(2^n-1)=1$ for all $n \\ge 2015$. (That is, it is a constant!) Thus, the minimum value is clearly $\\boxed{1}$."

        "inference": "The problem states that the sum of the elements in the $n$th row of Pascal's triangle is $2^n$.  The sum of the elements in the first $n$ rows is $2^n - 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$, where $f(n)$ is *some* function involving the sum of the elements in the first $n$ rows. However, the problem statement gives no expression for $f(n)$.  Therefore, we need to determine what $f(n)$ is supposed to be.\n\nThe given information tells us the sum of the first $n$ rows is $2^n-1$.  We are not given a function $f(n)$.\nIf we interpret the problem as wanting to find the minimum value of $2^n-1$ for $n \\ge 2015$, then this is clearly a strictly increasing function with $f(2015) = 2^{2015} - 1$. The minimum value for $n \\ge 2015$ occurs when $n=2015$, and $f(2015) = 2^{2015} - 1$.\n\nHowever, we need to determine what $f(n)$ is.
