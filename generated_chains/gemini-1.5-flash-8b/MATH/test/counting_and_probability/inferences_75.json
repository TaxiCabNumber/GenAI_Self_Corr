        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo candidates, Dan and Donald, run for class president. Two other candidates, Freddie and Bernie, run for vice president. Each candidate has a 50$\\%$ chance of winning. What is the probability that both Dan and Freddie win? (Express your answer as a fraction.)",
        "inference": "Dan winning has a probability of 0.5.\nFreddie winning has a probability of 0.5.\nSince the outcomes of the elections for president and vice president are independent events, the probability that both Dan and Freddie win is the product of their individual probabilities.\nProbability(Dan wins and Freddie wins) = Probability(Dan wins) \u00d7 Probability(Freddie wins)\n= 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.25\nThe probability is 0.25, which is equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.

        "ground_truth": "The probability that Dan wins is $\\frac12$. The probability that Freddie wins is also $\\frac12$. Therefore, the probability that both win is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 =\\boxed{\\frac14}$."
