At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if Pierre and Thomas want to sit together, but Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either of them? (Treat rotations as not distinct but reflections as distinct.)",
        "inference": "1. If Pierre and Thomas sit together, we treat them as a single unit.  There are 2 ways to arrange Pierre and Thomas (PT or TP).\n\n2. Now we have 7 entities to arrange around the circular table (the pair PT, and the remaining 6 people).  The number of ways to arrange n objects around a circular table is (n-1)!. So there are (7-1)! = 6! ways to arrange these 7 entities.\n\n3. Multiplying the arrangements of Pierre and Thomas (2 ways) and the arrangements of the other 7 entities (6!) gives us 2 * 6! = 2 * 720 = 1440 ways.\n\n4. However, Rosa doesn't want to sit next to either Pierre or Thomas.  Consider the case where Rosa sits between Pierre and Thomas (PT).  Then the possible arrangements are (PT-Rosa-rest). In the 1440 arrangements, some of these have Rosa sitting next to either Pierre or Thomas.\n\n5.  To find the arrangements where Rosa sits next to Pierre or Thomas, we treat Pierre and Thomas as a unit (PT or TP). Now we have 6 people to arrange around the circle (excluding Rosa). This gives us (6-1)! = 5! arrangements.  There are 2 ways to arrange Pierre and Thomas. Thus, there are 2 * 5! = 2 * 120 = 240 such arrangements.  \n\n6. Subtract the cases where Rosa is next to Pierre or Thomas from the total arrangements.  1440 - 240 = 1200\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1200}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\\cdot 4\\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.\n\nSolution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \\cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \\boxed{960}$."
