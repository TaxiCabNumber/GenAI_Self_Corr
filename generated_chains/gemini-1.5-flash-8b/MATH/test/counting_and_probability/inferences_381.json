I hope it is correct.'\nA large, regular hexagon is drawn on the ground, and a man stands at one of the vertices.  The man flips a coin.  If the coin lands heads, he walks counterclockwise along the edge of the hexagon until reaching the next nearest vertex.  If the coin lands tails, he walks clockwise around the hexagon until reaching another vertex.  Once there, he repeats the process.  The man flips the coin a total of six times.  What is the probability that the man is standing where he started when he is finished?",
