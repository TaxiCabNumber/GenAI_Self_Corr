At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?",

This can be done in $\\binom{10}{5}$ ways.\nAfter choosing 5 players for the first team, the remaining 5 players automatically form the second team.\nSo the number of ways to divide the 10 players into two teams of 5 is $\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2 \\times 9 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 252$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{252}$\n",
