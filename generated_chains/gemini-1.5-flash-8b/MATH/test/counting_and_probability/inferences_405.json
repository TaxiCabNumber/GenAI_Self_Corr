At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDuring a party, a total of 78 handshakes occurred. If each person shook hands once with each of the other people, how many people were at the party?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of people at the party.\nEach person shook hands with each of the other people once.\nThe number of handshakes is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\nWe are given that the total number of handshakes is 78.\nSo we have the equation $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 78$.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get $n(n-1) = 156$.\nWe are looking for two consecutive integers whose product is 156.\nWe can try integer values of $n$.\n$n=12$, $n(n-1) = 12(11) = 132$.\n$n=13$, $n(n-1) = 13(12) = 156$.\nSo $n=13$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \\choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \\cdot 78 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 13 = 12 \\cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party."
