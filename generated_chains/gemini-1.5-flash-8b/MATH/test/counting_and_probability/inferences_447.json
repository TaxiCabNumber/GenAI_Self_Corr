        "inference": "For integers from 1 to 99, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 10 integers (8, 18, 28, ..., 98). It appears in the tens place for 10 integers (80, 81, ..., 89). So in integers from 1 to 99, the digit 8 appears 20 times.\n\nFor integers from 100 to 999, the digit 8 appears in the units place for 100 integers (108, 118, ..., 998). The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 100 integers (180, 181, ..., 989). The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for 100 integers (800, 801, ..., 899). Thus, in integers from 100 to 999, the digit 8 appears 300 times.\n\nNow we consider the integers from 1 to 1000.\nIn the units place, the digit 8 appears for the integers 8, 18, 28, ..., 998. This pattern repeats every 10 integers, and there are 100 integers from 1 to 1000 that end in 8 (100 integers).\nIn the tens place, the integers are 80, 81, ..., 89, 180, 181, ..., 189, ..., 980, ..., 989. There are 10 integers that have 8 in the tens place for each hundred integers (100, 200, ..., 900). So there are 10 * 10 = 100 integers with 8 in the tens place.\nIn the hundreds place, the integers are 800, 801, ..., 899. There are 100 integers with 8 in the hundreds place.\nThe total number of times the digit 8 appears is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.\nFor integers from 1 to 99, the digit 8 appears in the units place and the tens place. So there are 20 times.\nFor integers from 100 to 999, the digit 8 appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place. So there are 100 * 3 = 300 times.\nTherefore, in the integers from 1 to 1000, the digit 8 appears 20 + 300 = 320 times.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{300}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8.
