        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Roman alphabet (26 letters, A through Z).  Each word in their language is 3 letters, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once.  How many 3-letter words are possible?",
        "inference": "1. Total possible 3-letter words without restriction: 26 choices for each of the 3 positions.  Thus, $26^3 = 17576$ possible words.\n\n2. Words without the letter A: There are 25 choices for each of the 3 positions.  Thus, $25^3 = 15625$ possible words without the letter A.\n\n3. Number of 3-letter words with at least one A: Total possible words minus words without any A.  $17576 - 15625 = 1951$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1951}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $26^3$ possible words that can be formed. Of those words, $25^3$ have no A. Thus, our answer is $26^3 - 25^3 = \\boxed{1951}$."
