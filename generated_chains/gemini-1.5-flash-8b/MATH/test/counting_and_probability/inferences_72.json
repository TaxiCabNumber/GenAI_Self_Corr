At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a three-digit number, the hundreds digit is greater than 5, the tens digit is greater than 4 but less than 8, and the units digit is the smallest prime number. How many three-digit numbers satisfy all of these conditions?",
        "inference": "The hundreds digit is greater than 5, so it can be 6, 7, or 8.\nThe tens digit is greater than 4 but less than 8, so it can be 5, 6, or 7.\nThe units digit is the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nThe possible hundreds digits are 6, 7, 8.\nThe possible tens digits are 5, 6, 7.\nThe possible units digits are 2.\n\nTo find the number of possible three-digit numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each digit.\nNumber of choices for hundreds digit: 3\nNumber of choices for tens digit: 3\nNumber of choices for units digit: 1\n\nTotal number of three-digit numbers = 3 * 3 * 1 = 9\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$\nI hope it is correct.\n",
