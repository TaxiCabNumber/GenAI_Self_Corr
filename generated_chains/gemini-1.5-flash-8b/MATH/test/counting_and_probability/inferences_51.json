        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. Two of the dice come up the same, but the other three are all different from those two and different from each other. The pair is set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled. The dice are said to show a \"full house\" if three of the dice show the same value and the other two show the same value (and potentially, but not necessarily, all five dice show the same value). What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?",
        "inference": "1. Probability of a pair on the first roll:\n   There are $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways to choose the pair of values, and $6^3$ ways to choose the values for the three remaining dice, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 15 \\times 60 = 900$ ways to have two dice the same and three different.  The total number of possible outcomes for the first roll is $6^5=7776$. So, the probability of getting a pair is $\\frac{900}{7776}$.\n\n2. Possible outcomes for the re-roll:\n   Given we have a pair, say (x,x), and three different numbers (y,z,w), for the re-roll we need three dice to match one value and two to match another. There are $\\binom{3}{1} \\times 2$ ways to choose the values of the three numbers (x, y, z, w) from which to form a full house.\n   a) We need three dice showing the same value and two dice showing another value.  \n      - There are 5 possibilities for the value shown on 3 dice.\n      - There are 5 possibilities for the value shown on 2 dice.\n\n3. Outcomes for a full house on the re-roll:\n   We need to choose 3 values from the set of values {y,z,w}.\n   If one value is chosen for 3 dice and another for 2 dice, we have $\\binom{3}{1}\\times 5^2 = 3\\times5^2 = 75$.\n   If the pair from the first roll is part of the full house, say $x$, then we have three dice showing $x$. We have 5 possible values left. So we choose 2 values from the remaining 5 to make a full house.\n   To have a full house, the remaining 3 dice must have two different numbers, each with one, two, or three dice.\n   Case 1: One value occurs three times, and a different value occurs two times.\n   - We have 5 choices for the value that occurs three times.\n   - We have 5 choices for the value that occurs two times.\n\n4. Probability of a full house in the re-roll, given a pair:\n   There are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ pairs of values.\n   If we have a pair of x, we can have full house in three ways: (x, x, x, y, y) or (x,x,x,z,z) or (x,x,y,y,y).\n   Probability of a full house given the pair:\n   a) Three of one kind, two of another kind.\n     There are $\\binom{5}{1}$ choices for the value occurring 3 times, and $\\binom{5}{1}$ choices for the value occurring twice. The remaining die can be any of the remaining 4 values.\n   So there are $5 \\times 4 = 20$ possibilities.\n   Then the probability is $\\frac{5\\times 4}{5\\times 5}= \\frac{20}{25}=\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n5. Final Calculation:\n   The probability of a pair is $\\frac{900}{7776}$.\n   The probability of getting a full house after the re-roll given a pair is $\\frac{5 \\times 20/25}{900/7776} = 20 / 25$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2/25}$",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nSo there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{21}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{72}}.$$"
