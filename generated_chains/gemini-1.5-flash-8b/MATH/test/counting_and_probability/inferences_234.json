At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that I have 6 different books, 2 of which are math books.  In how many ways can I stack my 6 books on a shelf if I want a math book on both ends of the stack?",

This can be done in $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ way.\n4. The remaining 4 books can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.\n5. The 2 math books can be arranged in the chosen positions in 2! ways.\n6. The total number of ways to arrange the books is $1 \\times 4! \\times 2! = 1 \\times 24 \\times 2 = 48$ ways.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$\n",

Then we place the four other books in the middle.  There are 4 choices for the first book, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and only 1 choice for the fourth.
