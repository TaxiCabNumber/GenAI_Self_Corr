At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can I place 5 different beads on a bracelet if rotations and flips of the bracelet are not treated as different arrangements?",
        "inference": "1. Total arrangements of 5 different beads in a linear arrangement: 5! = 120\n\n2. Rotational symmetry: Divide by 5 (the number of rotations).  120 / 5 = 24\n\n3. Reflectional symmetry:  For each arrangement, there's a reflected equivalent.  Divide by 2.  24 / 2 = 12\n\n4. Correct answer:  12\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to arrange 5 beads in a line.  Since there are 5 rotations in a circle for each of these arrangements, we must divide by 5, and since there are two matching reflections for each arrangement, we must divide by 2.  So there are $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$ ways."
