        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. Since Fred and Gwen must sit opposite each other, we can treat them as a single unit.\n2. There are 4 remaining people, so we treat them as 4 separate units.\n3. First, arrange the 5 units (Fred & Gwen as a unit + 4 other people) around the round table. There are (5-1)! = 4! ways to arrange them.\n4. For each arrangement of the 5 units, Fred and Gwen can switch places, which gives us 2 ways to arrange them within their unit.\n5. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 6 people around the round table with Fred and Gwen opposite each other is 4! * 2 = 24 * 2 = 48.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 choices of seats for Fred to sit in.  Once Fred is seated, then Gwen must sit opposite him.  This leaves 4 people to place in the four remaining seats, which can be done in $4!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 6 to account for the 6 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{6 \\times 1 \\times 4!}{6} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$.  Alternatively, we could start by fixing the table around Fred, thus removing the rotation.  There is 1 option for Gwen's seat, since she must sit across from him.  This leaves 4 people to place in four unique seats, so the number of arrangements is $4! = \\boxed{24}$."
