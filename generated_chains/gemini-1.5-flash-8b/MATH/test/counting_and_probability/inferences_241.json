        "inference": "1. First, we find the number of ways to choose 5 beads from 8 distinct beads. This is given by $\\binom{8}{5}$.\n$\\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!3!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\n\n2. Now we consider the circular arrangements of these 5 chosen beads on the necklace. The number of circular arrangements of n objects is (n-1)!. So, the number of circular arrangements of 5 beads is (5-1)! = 4!.\n4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\n\n3. However, we need to account for the fact that rotations and reflections are considered the same.  For a necklace with n beads, there are 2n ways to arrange the n beads.  Dividing by 2n gives us the number of unique arrangements.  \nIn this case, n = 5, so we have to divide the circular arrangements by 2n = 10. \n\n4. To correct this, we need to divide by the number of rotations and reflections.  For a necklace with n beads, the number of arrangements is $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\phi(d) \\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)!$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\nIn this case, n = 5, so we have\n$\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{d|5} \\phi(d) \\left(\\frac{5}{d}\\right)!$\n$\\frac{1}{5} (\\phi(1)(5)!) + \\frac{1}{5}(\\phi(5)(1)!) = \\frac{1}{5} (1 \\times 5! / 1) + \\frac{1}{5}(4 \\times 1) = \\frac{1}{5} (120) + \\frac{1}{5} (4) = 24 + \\frac{4}{5} = 24.8$.\nWe don't need the general formula because we have a 5 bead necklace,\n$\\frac{1}{5} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{5} = 4.8$. \n\n5. The number of circular arrangements of 5 beads is $\\frac{1}{5} (5-1)! = \\frac{4!}{2}$.\nThe number of circular arrangements of 5 beads is 12.\n$\\frac{(5-1)!}{2} = 12$.\nHowever, for necklaces with 5 beads, the factor of 2 appears when we divide by 2n = 10.\nTherefore, the correct value is (5-1)! = 24\n\n6. Since we have 56 ways to choose 5 beads from 8, and 12 ways to arrange the chosen beads in a circular arrangement, we multiply these values. \n56 x 12 = 672.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{672}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$."
