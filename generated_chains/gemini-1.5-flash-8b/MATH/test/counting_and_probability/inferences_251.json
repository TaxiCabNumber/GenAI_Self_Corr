        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Each question has a probability of 1/2 of being true or false.\nThe sequence is TFTFT.\nThe probability of getting T is 1/2.\nThe probability of getting F is 1/2.\nThe probability of getting the sequence TFTFT is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^5 = 1/32.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since all sequences of 5 answers are equally likely, the probability of any given 5-answer sequence is simply $\\frac{1}{2^5}$, since each answer is equally likely to be true or false. So, the answer evaluates to $\\frac{1}{2^5} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$."
