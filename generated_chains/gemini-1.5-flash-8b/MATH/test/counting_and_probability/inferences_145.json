        "ground_truth": "We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$."
