At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen rolling two fair, standard six-faced dice, what is the probability of rolling the same number on both dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die.  Therefore, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n\nThe outcomes where both dice show the same number are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), and (6,6).  There are 6 such outcomes.\n\nThe probability of rolling the same number on both dice is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nProbability = 6/36 = 1/6\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "No matter what the result of the first roll is, there are 6 equally likely possibilities for the second roll, only one of which is the same as the first roll.  Therefore, the probability that the dice show the same number is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
