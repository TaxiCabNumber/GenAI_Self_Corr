At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different 2-digit numbers are randomly chosen and multiplied together.  What is the probability that the resulting product is even?",
        "inference": "There are 90 possible products (10 * 9 = 90).\nThe product of two numbers is even if at least one of the numbers is even.\nThe two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99.\nThere are 5 even numbers (10, 12, ..., 98) for every 10 possible numbers.\nThe number of odd numbers is 45.\nThe number of even numbers is 45.\nThe probability that the first number is even is 45/90 = 1/2.\nThe probability that the second number is even is 45/90 = 1/2.\nThe probability that the product is even is\n1 - P(both odd).\nThe probability that both numbers are odd is (45/90) * (44/89) = 1/2 * 44/89 = 22/89.\n1 - (22/89) = 67/89.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{67}{90}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.\n\nNow we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.\n\nThere are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{3015}{4005} = \\boxed{\\frac{67}{89}}$."
