        "inference": "1. The total number of possible outcomes when flipping 6 coins is $2^6 = 64$.  This is because each coin flip has 2 possibilities (heads or tails), and we are flipping 6 coins.\n\n2. To find the probability of getting at least 2 heads, it's easier to find the probability of getting 0 or 1 head and subtract that from 1.\n\n3. The probability of getting 0 heads is $\\binom{6}{0} (\\frac{1}{2})^0 (\\frac{1}{2})^6 = \\frac{1}{64}$.\n\n4. The probability of getting 1 head is $\\binom{6}{1} (\\frac{1}{2})^1 (\\frac{1}{2})^5 = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{6}{64}$.\n\n5. The probability of getting 0 or 1 head is $\\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{6}{64} = \\frac{7}{64}$.\n\n6. The probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1 - \\frac{7}{64} = \\frac{57}{64}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.  There is only 1 way to get 0 heads, and $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to get 1 head, so the probability of getting at most one head is $\\dfrac{7}{64}$.  Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is $1-\\dfrac{7}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{57}{64}}$."
