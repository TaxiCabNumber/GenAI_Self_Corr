I hope it is correct.'\nLegolas flips a fair coin 2008 times, and Gimli flips another fair coin 2009 times. What is the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas?",
        "inference": "Let L be the number of heads Legolas gets and G be the number of heads Gimli gets.  L follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=2008 and p=1/2. G follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=2009 and p=1/2. We want to find P(G > L).  This is equivalent to P(G - L > 0).  Since the coin flips are independent, we can think of this as a difference of two binomial random variables.  However, the exact calculation is complex.\n\nInstead, we can use a symmetry argument.  If we consider the random variables G-L, G+L, they will be distributed in the same way as if Gimli had flipped 2009 times and Legolas had flipped 2008 times, except the order was switched.  Therefore the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas is the same as the probability that Legolas flips more heads than Gimli.\n\nLet's consider the case where G=2009-L. The number of heads Legolas gets is L, which follows a binomial distribution B(2008, 1/2).  The total number of heads Gimli could get is 0, 1, ..., 2009.  If Gimli gets k heads, then Legolas gets 2009-k heads.\nWe are interested in the probability P(G > L) = P(G - L > 0).\n\nBy symmetry, P(G > L) = P(L > G).  Since G and L are independent and follow binomial distributions with the same probability of success, we can say that  P(G > L) = P(L > G).\n\nSumming these probabilities, we have P(G > L) + P(L > G) + P(G = L) = 1.  Since P(G > L) = P(L > G), we have 2P(G > L) + P(G = L) = 1.  Because the number of trials is very large, P(G = L) is extremely small.  Thus, 2P(G > L) \u2248 1, and P(G > L) \u2248 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/2}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "After Gimli has flipped his coin 2008 times, the probability that he has more heads than Legolas is equal the probability that Legolas has more heads than him. Call this probability $p$. Then there is a $1-2p$ probability that they have the same number of heads. If Gimli already has more heads, he will have more heads after he flips again. If he has fewer heads, he cannot have more after just one more flip. If they are even, there is a $1/2$ chance he will flip another head, and therefore have more heads. In all, Gimli flips more heads than Legolas with probability $p+\\frac12(1-2p)=p+\\frac12-p=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."

Both L and G follow binomial distributions with parameters $n$ and $p=1/2$.\n\nWe want to find P(G > L). By symmetry, P(G > L) = P(L > G).  Since G and L are independent, the events G > L and L > G are not symmetric in a way that guarantees equality.\n\nThe probability that G = L is given by the probability that Gimli gets k heads and Legolas gets k heads.  We have $P(G = L) = \\sum_{k=0}^{min(2008,2009)} P(G=k, L=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2008} P(G=k) P(L=k)$\n\nFor large n, $P(G = L)$ is small because the number of heads obtained by the two individuals will not be equal. This implies that $P(G = L) = \\frac{1}{2}$.  Thus, $2P(G > L) + P(G = L) = 1$.\n\nUsing the symmetry argument, $P(G > L) + P(L > G) = 1 - P(G = L)$. Since $P(G > L) = P(L > G)$, $2P(G > L) + P(G = L) = 1$.\n\nSince n is large, $P(G=L) \\approx 0$. Then, $2P(G>L) \\approx 1$, so $P(G > L) \\approx 1/2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/2}$",
