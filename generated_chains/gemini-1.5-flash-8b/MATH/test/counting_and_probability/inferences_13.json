At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",
        "inference": "1.  Treat each party as a single block.  There are 2 blocks (Democrats and Republicans).  These 2 blocks can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways around the circular table.\n\n2.  Within each party block, there are 5 members.  They can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways within their block.\n\n3.  Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the committee members is 2! * (5!) * (5!) = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28800.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28800}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Choose any 5 consecutive seats in which to place the Democrats -- it doesn't matter which 5 consecutive seats that we choose, since we can rotate the table.  Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements."

        "inference": "The solution correctly calculates the arrangements within each party block (5! = 120 ways), but it incorrectly treats the arrangement of the blocks as if they were linear rather than circular.\n\nFor a circular arrangement of n objects, the number of circular permutations is (n-1)!.  In this case, with 2 blocks, there are (2-1)! = 1 way to arrange them in a circle.\n\nSo the correct calculation is 1 * 5! * 5! = 1 * 120 * 120 = 14400.\n\n$\\boxed{14400}$\n",
