At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can $7$ people sit around a round table if no two of the $3$ people Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other? (Seating arrangements which are rotations of each other are treated as the same.)",
        "inference": "Total ways to arrange 7 people around a circular table: (7-1)! = 6! = 720\n\nWays to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas together:\nTreat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single block. We have 5 blocks to arrange around the table: the block of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, and the other 4 people.\nNumber of ways to arrange the block of 3 people: 3! = 6\nNumber of ways to arrange the 5 blocks around the table: (5-1)! = 4! = 24\nSo, the number of ways to arrange them together is 6 * 24 = 144\n\nTotal ways to arrange 7 people such that no two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are together = Total arrangements - arrangements where they are together\n= 720 - 144 = 576\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{576}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.\n\nCase 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.\n\nPutting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \\boxed{144}$ seatings."
