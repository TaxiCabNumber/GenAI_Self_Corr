        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",
        "inference": "Let $m$ be the number of main courses.\nThe number of appetizers is $2m$.\nThe number of desserts is 3.\nThe total number of different dinners is the product of the number of choices for each part of the dinner.\nThe total number of different dinners is $2m \\times m \\times 3 = 6m^2$.\nWe want to find the least number of main courses $m$ such that $6m^2 \\ge 365$.\n$6m^2 \\ge 365$\n$m^2 \\ge \\frac{365}{6} = 60.8333...$\n$m^2 > 60.8333...$\n$m > \\sqrt{60.8333...} = 7.8$\nSince $m$ must be an integer, the least integer greater than 7.8 is 8.\nTherefore, the least number of main courses is 8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not."
