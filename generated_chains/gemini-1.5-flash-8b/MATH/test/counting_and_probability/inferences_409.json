I hope it is correct.'\nI have 18 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 8 white, 6 brown, and 4 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",

For white socks, we can choose 2 white socks in $\\binom{8}{2}$ ways.\n4. For brown socks, we can choose 2 brown socks in $\\binom{6}{2}$ ways.\n5. For blue socks, we can choose 2 blue socks in $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways.\n6. The total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color is the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 socks of each color.\n7. $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8!}{2!6!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$\n8. $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$\n9. $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$\n10.

        "ground_truth": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.
