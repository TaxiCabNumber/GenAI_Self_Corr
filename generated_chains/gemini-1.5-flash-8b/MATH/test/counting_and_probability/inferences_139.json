I hope it is correct.'\nA row of 8 light switches controls different banks of lights in a school gymnasium. In preparation for a school dance, students decide that they want either one or two banks of lights on during the dance. How many possible ways are there of setting these 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on?",
        "inference": "1. One bank on:\n   There are 8 switches, and we need to choose 1 switch to be on.  The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{8}{1} = 8$.\n\n2. Two banks on:\n   There are 8 switches, and we need to choose 2 switches to be on. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$.\n\n3. Total ways:\n   To get the total possible ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we add the number of ways for each case.\n   $8 + 28 = 36$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two cases here. If one bank of lights is on, there are $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways to choose which bank of lights it is. If two banks of lights are on, there are $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose which banks of lights they are. The total number of valid settings is $8+28=\\boxed{36}$."
