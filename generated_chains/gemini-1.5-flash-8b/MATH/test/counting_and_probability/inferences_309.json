I hope it is correct.'\nPat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
        "inference": "Let O, A, and B represent the number of oranges, apples, and bananas, respectively. We are choosing 8 pieces of fruit, so O + A + B = 8.\nCase 1: Exactly 3 oranges.\nWe need to choose 3 oranges out of 8 pieces of fruit. The remaining 5 pieces of fruit can be apples or bananas.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 oranges is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\nFor the remaining 5 pieces, we have 2 choices (apple or banana) for each piece. So there are $2^5 = 32$ ways to distribute the remaining 5 pieces.\nThe total number of ways to have exactly 3 oranges is $56 \\times 32 = 1792$.\n\nCase 2: Exactly 6 apples.\nWe need to choose 6 apples out of 8 pieces of fruit. The remaining 2 pieces of fruit can be oranges or bananas.\nThe number of ways to choose 6 apples is $\\binom{8}{6} = \\frac{8!}{6!2!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28$.\nFor the remaining 2 pieces, we have 2 choices (orange or banana) for each piece. So there are $2^2 = 4$ ways to distribute the remaining 2 pieces.\nThe total number of ways to have exactly 6 apples is $28 \\times 4 = 112$.\n\nSince the two cases are mutually exclusive, the total number of ways to have either exactly 3 oranges or exactly 6 apples is $1792 + 112 = 1904$.\nThe total number of ways to choose 8 pieces of fruit is $3^8 = 6561$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{1904}{6561}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1904}{6561}}$",
        "ground_truth": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$."
