At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA European train compartment has six seats.  Four of the seats are broken.  Wilhelm needs to fill out a form like the one here to indicate that there are broken seats.  If he randomly checks off four of the seats in the diagram, what is the probability that he marked the correct seats?

        "inference": "The problem states that 4 seats are broken and 2 are good. We want to find the probability of choosing 4 good seats out of 6.  The problem implies that the 4 correct seats are a subset of the 6 seats.  However, there's no information about which seats are broken, which is crucial for calculating the probability.  Assuming the 4 broken seats are randomly distributed amongst the 6 seats, the probability of picking 4 specific seats remains the same.\nWe are selecting 4 seats from 6. The number of ways to choose 4 seats out of 6 is $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$.\nThe number of ways to choose 4 broken seats out of 4 is $\\binom{4}{4}=1$.\nThe probability of selecting only broken seats is $\\frac{\\binom{4}{4}}{\\binom{6}{4}}=\\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nThe problem statement does not say which 4 seats are correct. So, if we are picking 4 seats out of 6 randomly, then there is only 1 way to choose the 4 correct seats.\nThe probability of choosing all the 4 broken seats out of 6 seats.\nThe number of ways to choose 4 seats from 6 is $\\binom{6}{4} = 15$.\nThe probability is $\\frac{\\binom{4}{4}}{\\binom{6}{4}} = \\frac{1}{15}$.\n\nThe solution is correct.\n$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$\n",
