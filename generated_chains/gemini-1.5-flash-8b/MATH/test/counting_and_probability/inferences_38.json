At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree couples go to the movie theater. They want to seat people together for maximum enjoyment, but instead they randomly file into a row with six seats. What is the probability that they sit in a socially optimal configuration, in which each person is sitting next to his or her partner?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to arrange 6 people in 6 seats is 6! = 720.\n\n2. Consider each couple as a block. There are 3 couples, so there are 3! ways to arrange the couples.\n\n3. Within each couple, there are 2 ways to arrange the partners (partner 1, partner 2 or partner 2, partner 1). So, there are 2 ways to arrange each couple.\n\n4. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the couples such that each person is sitting next to his/her partner is 3! * 2 * 2 * 2 = 6 * 8 = 48.\n\n5. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n6. Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = 48 / 720 = 1/15.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to pick people to fill the first two seats, and 3 ways for those two people to be a couple, for a probability $3/15 = 1/5$ that the first two seats are a couple. If a couple is seated successfully, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to seat people in the next two seats, and 2 ways for those two people to be a couple (you could pick either of the two remaining couples), for a probability $2/6 = 1/3$ that those two seats are a couple. If the first two couples are seated successfully, the last two seats will be guaranteed to go to the last couple. So, the probability that everything goes right is $1/5 \\cdot 1/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{15}}$."
