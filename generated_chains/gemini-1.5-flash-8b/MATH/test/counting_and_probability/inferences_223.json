At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMorgan has 3 hockey shirts, 2 football shirts and 7 baseball shirts in her closet. If she randomly selects one of these shirts, what is the probability that it will not be a baseball shirt? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
