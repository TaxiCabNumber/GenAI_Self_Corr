At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA drawer contains 3 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
        "inference": "There are a total of 3 + 6 = 9 balls.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 balls from 9 is $\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36$.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 white balls from 3 is $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3$.\nThe probability that both balls are white is $\\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$ I hope it is correct.",
