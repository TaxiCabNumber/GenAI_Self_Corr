At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
        "inference": "1. We need a three-digit odd number, meaning the last digit must be odd.\n2. The odd digits available are 3 and 5.\n3. For the last digit, we have 2 choices (3 or 5).\n4. For the first digit, we have 3 choices (since we cannot repeat the last digit).\n5. For the second digit, we have 2 choices (since we cannot repeat the first or last digit).\n6. The number of possible three-digit odd numbers is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed."

        "inference": "Let the three-digit odd number be represented as ABC.\nWe are given that the last digit must be odd, and the odd digits available are 3 and 5.\nSo the last digit (C) can be either 3 or 5. This gives us 2 choices for C.\nSince we cannot repeat digits, the first digit (A) can be any of the digits remaining, excluding C.  If C=3, A can be 5, and if C=5, A can be 3.  This gives us 2 choices for A.\nThe middle digit (B) can be any digit remaining, excluding A and C. This gives us 1 choice for B.\n\nThe number of possible three-digit odd numbers is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$",
