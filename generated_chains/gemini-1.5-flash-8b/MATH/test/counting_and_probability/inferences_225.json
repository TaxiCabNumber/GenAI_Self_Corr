        "ground_truth": "Let's try counting the number of perfect squares and cubes less than $441=21^2$. There are twenty perfect squares less than 441: $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 20^2$.

Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400.
