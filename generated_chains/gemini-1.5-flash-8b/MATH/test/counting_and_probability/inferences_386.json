At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "Total ways to seat 8 people around a table without restrictions is (8-1)! = 7! = 5040.\nWays to seat Alice and Bob together is to consider them as a single unit. Then we have 7 units to arrange around the table, which is (7-1)! = 6! = 720. Since Alice and Bob can swap places, we multiply by 2 to get 2 * 6! = 1440.\nThe number of ways Alice and Bob sit next to each other is 1440.\nThe number of ways Alice and Bob do not sit next to each other is the total number of ways to seat 8 people minus the number of ways they sit next to each other.\n5040 - 1440 = 3600.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3600}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$."
