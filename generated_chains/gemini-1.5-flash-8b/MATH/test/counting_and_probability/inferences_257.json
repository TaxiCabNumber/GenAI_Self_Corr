At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 10 players, including Steve and Danny.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this if Steve and Danny insist on playing on opposing teams?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to choose a team for Steve.  There are two choices: team A or team B.\n2. Since Steve is on one team, Danny must be on the other. This determines their teams.\n3. Now we need to choose 4 more players for Steve's team.  There are 8 players left (10 total - Steve - Danny).  The number of ways to choose 4 players from 8 is $\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70$.\n4. Once we've chosen Steve's team, the remaining 4 players automatically form Danny's team.\n5. Thus, the total number of ways to form the teams is the product of the choices: $2 \\times 70 = 140$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{140}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Steve and Danny are on opposite teams, there are 8 other players to choose from for the other 4 spots on Steve's team, so there are $\\binom{8}{4} = \\boxed{70}$ choices."
