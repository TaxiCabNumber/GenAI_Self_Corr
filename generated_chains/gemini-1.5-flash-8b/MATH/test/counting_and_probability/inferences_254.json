At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",

The two boys can be arranged within their unit in 2! ways.\n4. Therefore, the total number of ways is 5! * 2!.\n5. 5! = 120, and 2! = 2.\n6. 120 * 2 = 240.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{240}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

        "inference": "The problem is asking for the number of ways to arrange 2 boys and 6 girls in a row.  Treating the two boys as a single unit is incorrect.  The boys are distinct, and there are 2! ways to arrange them within their \"unit\".  Thus the correct way to arrange the 2 boys and 6 girls is 8! (total ways to arrange the 8 people) divided by 2! (to account for the two distinct ways to arrange the 2 boys).  This means 8! / 2! = 20160 / 2 = 10080 ways to arrange the 8 people.\n\nThe calculation is:\n$\\frac{8!}{2!} = \\frac{40320}{2} = 20160$\n$\\frac{8!}{2!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1} = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 20160$.\n\n\nThe correct solution is $8! / 2! = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{2} = 10080$\n$\\boxed{10080}$\n",
