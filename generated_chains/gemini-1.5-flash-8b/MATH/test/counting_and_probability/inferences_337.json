At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA club has 20 members, 12 boys and 8 girls.  Two of the members are chosen at random.  What is the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to choose 2 members from 20 is $\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190$.\n\n2. Number of ways to choose 1 boy from 12 is $\\binom{12}{1} = 12$.\n\n3. Number of ways to choose 1 girl from 8 is $\\binom{8}{1} = 8$.\n\n4. Number of ways to choose 1 boy and 1 girl is $\\binom{12}{1} \\times \\binom{8}{1} = 12 \\times 8 = 96$.\n\n5.

        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$ ways to choose two members of the group. There are $12$ ways to choose a boy and $8$ ways to choose a girl for a total of $12 \\cdot 8 = 96$ ways to choose a boy and a girl.  This means that there is a $\\dfrac{96}{190} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}}$ chance that the two random members of the group are a boy and a girl."
