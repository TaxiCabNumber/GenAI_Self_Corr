Two marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and one is blue? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Number of ways to choose 1 red marble from 12: 12C1 = 12\n4. Number of ways to choose 1 blue marble from 6: 6C1 = 6\n5. Number of ways to choose 1 red and 1 blue marble: 12C1 * 6C1 = 12 * 6 = 72\n6.
