I hope it is correct.'\nTwo numbers, $x$ and $y$ are selected at random from the interval $(0,3)$.  What is the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists?",

The region in the square where $x > 0, y > 0, x < 3, y < 3$ is the square with area 9.\nThe area of the triangle with vertices (1,0), (0,1) and (3,3) can be calculated by finding the area of the region under the line $y = -x+1$, above the line $y=x-1$, and $x+y>1$.
