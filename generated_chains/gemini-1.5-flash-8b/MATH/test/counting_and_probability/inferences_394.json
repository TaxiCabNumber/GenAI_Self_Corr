        "inference": "To find the position of 53 when counting backward from 201 to 3, we need to determine how many numbers are before 53 in the backward sequence.  The numbers backward are 201, 200, 199, ..., 54, 53, ...  We count the numbers from 201 down to 54. The count is $201 - 54 + 1 = 148$.\nSo the 148th number in the backward sequence is 54.\nSince we want to find the position of 53, which is one less than 54, the position is 148+1 = 149.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{149}$",
