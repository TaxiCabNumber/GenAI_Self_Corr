        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex has four books of different sizes which he wishes to place on a bookshelf. Unfortunately, the bookshelf has a conspicuous hole at one end through which only the smallest book can fall. If he wishes for all his books to stay stationary, in how many ways can he arrange his books?",
        "inference": "1. The smallest book must be placed in the hole.  This leaves 3 positions for the other books.\n\n2. There are 3 remaining books.  The first book can be placed in any of the 3 remaining positions.\n\n3. Once the first book is placed, there are 2 positions remaining for the second book.\n\n4. Once the first two books are placed, there is only 1 position remaining for the third book.\n\n5. Therefore, there are 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 ways to arrange the remaining books.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest book cannot be placed at one end, so there are three positions which it can occupy. The other books can each be placed in any of the three remaining positions, giving $3!$ arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $3\\times3!=\\boxed{18\\text{ ways.}}$"
