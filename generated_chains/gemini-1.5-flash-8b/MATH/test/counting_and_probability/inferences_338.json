        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI coach a soccer team with 15 members.  I want to choose a starting lineup consisting of 11 players, two of whom will represent the team in the captains meeting at the beginning of the game.  In how many ways can I choose my starting lineup, including designating the two captains?",
        "inference": "1. Choose 11 players from 15: $\\binom{15}{11} = \\frac{15!}{11!4!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 15 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 1365$.\n2. Choose 2 captains from the 11 chosen players: $\\binom{11}{2} = \\frac{11!}{2!9!} = \\frac{11 \\times 10}{2} = 55$.\n3. Multiply the number of ways to choose the players and the number of ways to choose the captains: $1365 \\times 55 = 75,175$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75175}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways."
