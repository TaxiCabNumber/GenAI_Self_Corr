At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n23 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at least one other person. What is the minimum possible number of handshakes?",
        "inference": "To minimize the number of handshakes, we need to distribute the handshakes as evenly as possible among the 23 people.  If each person shakes hands with only one other person, then we need 23/2 = 11.5 handshakes per person. Since we can't have half a handshake, we need to make sure each person shakes hands with at least one other person.  This means each person must shake at least one other person's hand. If 22 people shake hands with one other person, then the remaining person must shake the hands of at least one person.  The minimum number of handshakes is when 22 people shake hands with one person each.  Then the 23rd person shakes the hand of one person, so there are 22 handshakes. This gives a minimum of 22 handshakes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\\frac{23 \\cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\\boxed{12}$ handshakes total."
