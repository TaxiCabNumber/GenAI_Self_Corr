At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 8 people sit around a round table if 3 of the people -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all want to sit together?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit.  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them within the unit.\n2. Now we have 6 entities (the unit and the other 5 people) to arrange around the circular table.  There are (6-1)! = 5! = 120 ways to arrange them.\n3. Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within the unit (6) by the number of ways to arrange the 6 entities around the table (120).\n4. 6 * 120 = 720\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First choose three consecutive seats for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas.  It doesn't matter which three consecutive seats that we choose, since any three such seats can be rotated to any other such seats.  Once the three seats are chosen, there are $3!$ ways to seat the three friends there.  The other five seats are for the other five people, so there are $5!$ ways to seat them there.  The answer is $3! \\times 5! = \\boxed{720}$."
