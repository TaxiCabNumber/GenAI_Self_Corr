At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Coventry School's European debate club has 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates.  In how many ways can these 14 delegates sit in a row of 14 chairs, if each country's delegates insist on all sitting next to each other?",
        "inference": "1. First, consider the 3 groups of delegates: German, French, and Italian.  These 3 groups can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n\n2. Within each group, the delegates can be arranged among themselves in 6! ways for the German delegates, 5! ways for the French delegates, and 3! ways for the Italian delegates.\n\n3. Multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups (3!) by the number of ways to arrange the delegates within each group (6! * 5! * 3!).\n\n4. Calculate: 6! = 720, 5! = 120, 3! = 6.  So, the total number of ways is 3! * 6! * 5! * 3! = 6 * 720 * 120 * 6 = 3110400.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3110400}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates."
