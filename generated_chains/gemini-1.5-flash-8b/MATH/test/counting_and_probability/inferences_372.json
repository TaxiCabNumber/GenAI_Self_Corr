At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBeginning at point $A$ in the diagram below, Dora selects one of the four possible directions with equal probability. Each time she comes to an intersection, she again randomly selects one of the possible directions. What is the probability that, in her first four steps, she will walk completely around the gray square? Express your answer as a common fraction.
