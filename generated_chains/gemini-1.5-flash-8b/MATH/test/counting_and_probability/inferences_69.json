        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLicense plates in the newly established state of Atlantis consist of three letters followed by three digits.  The first letter must be a vowel (y is not considered a vowel), and no letter can be repeated.  The first digit must be one of $\\{1,2,4,6\\}$, which corresponds to the location the license was issued.  No digit may be repeated.  How many possible license plates exist?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Vowels: The vowels are A, E, I, O, U. The first letter must be a vowel. There are 5 choices.\n2. Letters: The first letter is chosen, so there are 25 letters left for the second letter, and 24 for the third letter.\n3. Digits: The first digit must be one of {1, 2, 4, 6}. There are 4 choices.\n4. Digits (cont.): The first digit is chosen, so there are 9 digits left (0-9 excluding the first).\n5. Digits (cont.): The second digit is chosen, so there are 8 digits left.\n6. Total: Multiply the number of choices for each position:\n   5 choices (vowel) * 25 choices (second letter) * 24 choices (third letter) * 4 choices (first digit) * 9 choices (second digit) * 8 choices (third digit)\n   = 5 * 25 * 24 * 4 * 9 * 8 = 360000\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360000}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we can count the number of ways to arrange the letters.  There are $5$ choices for the first letter, since it must be a vowel.  This leaves $25$ possibilities for the second letter, since there are no repeats, and then $24$ possibilities for the third letter, for a total of: $$5\\times25\\times24=3000\\text{ letter arrangements}$$Next, we can count the number of ways to arrange the digits.  There are $4$ possible choices for the first digit, corresponding to the four elements of the set $\\{1,2,4,6\\}$.  This leaves $9$ remaining choices for the next digit, and $8$ choices for the last digit, a total of: $$4\\times9\\times8=288\\text{ digit arrangements}$$Since the digits and letters can be arranged independently, the total number of license plates will be: $$3000\\times288=\\boxed{864000}$$"
