At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Smith family has 4 sons and 3 daughters.  In how many ways can they be seated in a row of 7 chairs such that all 3 girls sit next to each other?",
        "inference": "1. Treat the 3 girls as a single unit.  There are 4 boys and 1 unit (3 girls).  So there are 5 units to arrange.\n2. The 5 units can be arranged in 5! ways.\n3. The 3 girls within their unit can be arranged in 3! ways.\n4. Multiply the number of arrangements of the 5 units by the number of arrangements of the 3 girls within the unit: 5! * 3! = 120 * 6 = 720\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We want to deal with the restriction first.\n\nWithout worrying about which specific boys and girls go in which seats, in how many ways can the girls sit together?\n\nThere are 5 basic configurations of boys and girls:  $$GGGBBBB, BGGGBBB, BBGGGBB,$$ $$BBBGGGB, BBBBGGG$$ where $B$ is a boy and $G$ is a girl.  Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.\n\nTherefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \\times 4! \\times 3! = \\boxed{720}$."

        "inference": "The problem states that 3 girls and 4 boys are to be arranged in a row.  We need to find the number of ways to arrange them.  The 3 girls can be considered as a single unit, and the 4 boys are individual units.  Then we have 5 units to arrange: 4 boys and 1 unit (3 girls). The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct units is 5!.  Within the 3 girls' unit, they can be arranged in 3! ways.  So we multiply 5! by 3!.\n\n5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n\n120 \u00d7 6 = 720\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$",
