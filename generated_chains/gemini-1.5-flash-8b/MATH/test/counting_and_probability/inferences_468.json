At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA theater group has eight members, of which four are females. How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender?",
        "inference": "1. Female lead: 4 choices.\n2. Male lead: 4 choices (8 total members - 4 females).\n3. Object 1: 8 choices (either gender).\n4. Object 2: 7 choices (either gender, one less choice).\n5. Object 3: 6 choices (either gender, two less choices).\n\nMultiply the choices together:\n4 * 4 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 6720\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6720}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 ways to select the female lead and 4 ways to select the male lead. Afterwards, there are 6 members who can play the first inanimate object, 5 who can play the second, and 4 for the last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4\\times4\\times6\\times5\\times4 = \\boxed{1920\\text{ ways.}}$"
