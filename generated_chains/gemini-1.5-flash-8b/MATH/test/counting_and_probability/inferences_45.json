At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA customer ordered 15 pieces of gourmet chocolate. The order can be packaged in small boxes that contain 1, 2 or 4 pieces of chocolate. Any box that is used must be full. How many different combinations of boxes can be used for the customer's 15 chocolate pieces? One such combination to be included is to use seven 2-piece boxes and one 1-piece box.",

        "ground_truth": "Note that at least one of the boxes must be a $1$-piece box, because the number of chocolates ordered was odd.
