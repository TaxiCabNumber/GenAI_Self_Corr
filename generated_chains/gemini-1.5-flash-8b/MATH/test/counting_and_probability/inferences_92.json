        "inference": "1. Choose 4 points out of 200. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{200}{4} = \\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times 197}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$.\n2. To form a square, the four chosen points must be equally spaced on the circle. Let the points be $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ in order around the circle.\n3. The distance between consecutive points is $360^\\circ / 200 = 1.8^\\circ$.\n4. The four points must be separated by $90^\\circ$. The number of choices for the first point is 200.\n5. Once the first point is chosen, the next three points are determined by the distance of $90^\\circ$ around the circle.\n6. However, we need to consider the cyclic nature of the arrangement. For a square to be formed, the points must be separated by $90^\\circ$.\n7.  Possible arrangements of the four points are rotations of each other.\n8. To count the squares, we fix one point, say $P_1$. The second point is $90^\\circ$ away, the third point is $180^\\circ$ away, and the fourth point is $270^\\circ$ away.\n9. We have 200 choices for the first point.\n10. The points must be separated by $90^\\circ$ apart.\n11. This means that we have $200/4 = 50$ sets of points separated by $90^\\circ$.\n12. The total number of squares is the number of sets of 4 points separated by 90 degrees, which is $200 \\times 50 = 10000$.\n13. We must account for the rotations. Since the points are spaced equally around the circle, if we fix one point, there is only one way to choose the other points to make a square.\n14.  The number of ways to choose the first point is 200.\n15. The next point is determined by the $90^\\circ$ angle.\n16.  We have 200 possible starting points.  The second point is 50 choices away. The third point is 100 choices away. The fourth point is 150 choices away. Thus, we have 200 $\\times 50 = 10,000$. \n17. Since there are 200 points, the angles are $1.8$ degrees apart. To form a square, the points must be $90^\\circ$ apart, which means the spacing is $90^\\circ / 1.8^\\circ = 50$ choices. This is the same as 50.  There are 200 choices for the first point. The next point must be 50 away.\n18. Thus the number of squares is $200 \\times 50 = 10,000$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10000}$",
        "ground_truth": "For any given one of the 200 points, we can find exactly one square with that point as one of the vertices---that point, the point diametrically opposite it, and the endpoints of the diameter that is perpendicular to the diameter formed by connecting the first two points.  Each square then accounts for 4 vertices, so there are $200/4=\\boxed{50}$ squares."
