At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Smith brings home 7 animals for his 7 children.  Each child will adopt a pet to be her or his own.  There are 4 different cats (a Siamese, a Persian, a Calico, and a Minx), 2 different dogs (a Poodle and a Golden Retriever), and a goldfish.  Anna and Betty refuse to take care of the goldfish, and Charlie and Danny insist on having cats.  The other 3 kids are easier to please -- they'll take anything.  In how many ways can Mr. Smith give the children pets they'll want?",
        "inference": "1. Charlie and Danny must have cats: 4 choices for Charlie, 3 choices for Danny.  This leaves 2 cats.\n\n2. Anna and Betty refuse the goldfish: The goldfish can be given to one of the 5 remaining children.\n\n3.  The remaining 3 children can have any of the remaining pets: 2 dogs, 2 cats (from the previous step), 1 goldfish. This gives 5 choices. Thus, there are 5*4*3 = 60 ways to give pets to the 3 children.\n\n4.  The number of ways to give the remaining 2 cats to Charlie and Danny: 4 * 3 = 12\n\n5.  The number of ways to give the goldfish to one of the 5 children: 5 choices\n\n6.  The number of ways to give the 2 dogs to the remaining 3 children: 3 children can choose from 2 dogs, yielding 3 * 2 = 6 ways.\n\n7. Combining all steps: 12 ways * 5 ways * 6 ways = 360 ways.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
