        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls.  Bin $B$ has three balls labeled $\\$1$ and one ball labeled $\\$7$.  Bin $W$ has five balls labeled $\\$8$ and one ball labeled $\\$500$.  A game is played as follows: a ball is randomly selected from bin $A$.  If it is black, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $B$; otherwise, if the original ball is white, then a ball is randomly selected from bin $W$.  You win the amount printed on the second ball selected.  What is your expected win?",
