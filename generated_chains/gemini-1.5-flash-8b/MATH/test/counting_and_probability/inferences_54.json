This means we have $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$ possible pairs of positions for attaching the triangles.\n\n2. **Congruence considerations:** Rotation and reflection symmetry are crucial.\n   - Rotating the figure around the center of the pentagon by multiples of $72^\\circ$ yields congruent figures.\n   - Reflecting the figure across an axis of symmetry also yields congruent figures.\n\n3. **Analyzing the possible pairs:**  The pairs of positions (e.g., positions 1 and 2) can be rotated into one another.  If the triangles are the same, the figures will be congruent.\n\n4. **Unique pairs:**  By considering the rotation and reflection symmetries, we can identify unique arrangements.\n   - If the two triangles are attached to adjacent vertices, there are 5 possible such arrangements (one for each pair of adjacent vertices).  Consider the example of vertices A and B.  By rotation, these are all the same.\n   - If the two triangles are attached to vertices that are two apart (like A and C), again the arrangements can be rotated into each other.  By rotation, these are all the same.\n   - If the two triangles are attached to vertices that are 3, 4 or 5 apart, the figures are rotated versions of one another.\n\n5. **Distinct figures:** After applying the symmetry arguments, we can count the non-congruent figures.  By inspection of the possible pairs of positions, we find that there are 5 cases where the two attachments are adjacent (e.g., positions A and B are the same as A and E and so on.)  For the pairs two vertices apart there are also 5 cases. The other cases (three vertices, four vertices, and five vertices apart) all give congruent figures via rotations.  \n\n6. **Final Answer:** By careful inspection and application of symmetry, only 2 distinct figures are possible.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$\n",
