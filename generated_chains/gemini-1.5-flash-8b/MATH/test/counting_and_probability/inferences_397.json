At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGerry goes to sleep at 11 pm each night. But he doesn't sleep very well, so he awakens at a random time between 1:00 am and 3:59 am, with each minute equally likely (including 1:00 and 3:59). He then reads the hour and minute shown on his clock as a three digit number, so 2:56 am would be 256. What is the probability that that number will be divisible by 7?",

A more direct approach is to find the integers from 1 to 239 that are divisible by 7.\nThere are $\\lfloor \\frac{239}{7} \\rfloor = 34$ integers between 1 and 239 inclusive that are divisible by 7. \n\nThus, the probability that a randomly chosen time is divisible by 7 is $\\frac{34}{239}$.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{34}{239}}$\n",
