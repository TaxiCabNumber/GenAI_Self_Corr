At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMs. Hamilton's eighth-grade class wants to participate in the annual three-person-team basketball tournament.  Lance, Sally, Joy, and Fred are chosen for the team.  In how many ways can the three starters be chosen?",
        "inference": "We need to choose 3 starters from a group of 4 people.\nThis is a combination problem, since the order in which we choose the starters doesn't matter.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 people from 4 is given by the combination formula:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nIn this case, $n = 4$ and $k = 3$, so we have:\n$$ \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(1)} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4 $$\nThus, there are 4 ways to choose the three starters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When three players start, one is the alternate.  Because any of the four players might be the alternate, there are four ways to select a starting team: Lance-Sally-Joy, Lance-Sally-Fred, Lance-Joy-Fred, and Sally-Joy-Fred.  Or, we can simply note that we have $\\boxed{4}$ choices for who to leave out!"
