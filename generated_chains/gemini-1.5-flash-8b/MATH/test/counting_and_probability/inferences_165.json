        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $x$, $\\frac{1}{x}$, $y$, $\\frac{1}{y}$, $z$ and $\\frac{1}{z}$ are all integers, how many distinct values of $x+ y+ z$ are possible?",
        "inference": "If $x, \\frac{1}{x}, y, \\frac{1}{y}, z, \\frac{1}{z}$ are integers, then $x, y, z$ must be positive integers.  Since $\\frac{1}{x}$ is an integer, $x$ must be 1.  Similarly, $y = 1$ and $z = 1$.  Then $x + y + z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $x$ and $1/x$ are integers, we know that $x$ is an integer that divides 1 evenly.  Therefore, we must have $x = -1$ or $x = 1$. The same is true for $y$ and $z$. So, the possible sums are $3(-1) = -3$, $2(-1) + 1 = -1$, $2(1) + -1 = 1$ or $3(1) = 3$. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible values for the sum."
