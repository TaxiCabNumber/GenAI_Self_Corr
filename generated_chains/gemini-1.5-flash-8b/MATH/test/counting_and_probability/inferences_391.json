At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA player chooses one of the numbers 1 through 4. After the choice has been made, two regular four-sided (tetrahedral) dice are rolled, with the sides of the dice numbered 1 through 4. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of exactly one die after it is rolled, then the player wins $\\$1.$ If the number chosen appears on the bottom of both of the dice, then the player wins $\\$2.$ If the number chosen does not appear on the bottom of either of the dice, the player loses $\\$1.$ What is the expected return to the player, in dollars, for one roll of the dice? Give your answer as a fraction.",
