        "ground_truth": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
