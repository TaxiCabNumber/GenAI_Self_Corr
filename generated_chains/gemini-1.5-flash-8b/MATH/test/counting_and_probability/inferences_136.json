        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of cards has 26 cards which are considered \"red\" (the 'hearts' and 'diamonds') and 26 which are considered \"black\" (the 'spades' and 'clubs'). In how many different ways can we choose two red cards from the deck? (Note: Order matters in the sense that drawing an ace of hearts followed by jack of diamonds is different than drawing a jack of diamonds followed by ace of hearts, for instance.)",
        "inference": "There are 26 red cards in a standard deck.\nWe need to choose 2 red cards.\nThe first card can be chosen in 26 ways.\nAfter choosing the first red card, there are 25 red cards remaining.\nThe second card can be chosen in 25 ways.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose two red cards from the deck is 26 * 25 = 650.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{650}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For the number of successful possibilities, there are 26 ways to pick a red card first (since there are 26 total red cards), then there are 25 ways to also pick a second red card (since there are 25 red cards remaining after we've chosen the first card).  Thus, there are a total of $26 \\times 25 = \\boxed{650}$ total successful possibilities."

        "inference": "The problem is that the order in which the two cards are chosen doesn't matter.  We are counting the selections (red card 1, red card 2) and (red card 2, red card 1) as different selections.  This is an example of combinations, not permutations.  The correct formula to use is $\\binom{26}{2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{650}{2} = 325$.\n\n$\\boxed{325}$\n",
