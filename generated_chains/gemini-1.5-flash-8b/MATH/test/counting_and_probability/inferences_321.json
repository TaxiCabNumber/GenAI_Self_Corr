        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA player pays $\\$5$ to play a game. A six-sided die is rolled. If the number on the die is odd, the game is lost. If the number on the die is even, the die is rolled again. In this case the player wins some amount of money if the second number matches the first and loses otherwise. How much money should the player win if the game is fair? (In a fair game the probability of winning times the amount won is what the player should pay.)",
        "inference": "Let $X$ be the random variable representing the amount the player wins.\nThe player pays $5 to play the game.\nIf the first roll is odd, the game is lost. The probability of this is $P(\\text{odd}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIf the first roll is even, the die is rolled again. The player wins if the second roll matches the first. The probability of the first roll being even is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nLet the first roll be $x$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ represent the amount the player wins if the game is fair.  The chance of an even number is $1/2$, and the chance of matching this number on the second roll is $1/6$. So the probability of winning is $(1/2)(1/6)=1/12$. Therefore $(1/12)x=\\$5$ and $x=\\boxed{60}$."
