At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "Consider John and Sam as a single unit.\nWe have 5 units to arrange around the table.\nThe number of ways to arrange n objects around a circle is (n-1)!\nSo, the number of ways to arrange 5 units is (5-1)! = 4! = 24.\nJohn and Sam can switch places, so there are 2 ways for them to sit next to each other.\nThe total number of ways to seat 6 people around a table if John and Sam sit next to each other is 2 * 4! = 2 * 24 = 48.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "To take care of rotations, we can fix John at the topmost seat.  We then have two choices for Sam: either side of John. The other four may sit anywhere in the other four seats. Thus there are $2\\times 4! = \\boxed{48}$ ways."
