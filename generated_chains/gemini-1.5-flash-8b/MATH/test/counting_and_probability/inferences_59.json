At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen people are sitting around a round table.  Three of them are chosen at random to give a presentation.  What is the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to choose 3 people from 10 is $\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120$.\n2. Number of ways to choose 3 consecutive seats is 8.  (Imagine the people are labeled 1, 2, ..., 10.  The consecutive groups are (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), ..., (8, 9, 10), and (9, 10, 1)).\n3. For each choice of 3 consecutive seats, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the 3 chosen people in the seats.\n4. Thus, the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive seats and assign the 3 chosen people to them is $8 \\times 3! = 8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n5. The probability is $\\frac{48}{120} = \\frac{48/12}{120/12} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
