At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the total number of four-digit palindromes. (Recall that a palindrome is a nonnegative sequence of digits which reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 1331. Zero cannot be the first digit.)",
        "inference": "A four-digit palindrome has the form $abba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits from 0 to 9.\nSince the first digit cannot be zero, we have $a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, so there are 9 choices for $a$.\nFor $b$, $b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$, so there are 10 choices for $b$.\nThe total number of four-digit palindromes is the product of the number of choices for $a$ and the number of choices for $b$, which is $9 \\times 10 = 90$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In a four-digit palindrome, the first digit is the same as the last, and the second digit is the same as the third digit.  There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).  This gives us $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes."
