At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe planning committee at school has 11 members. Exactly five of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
        "inference": "1. Total members: 11\n2. Teachers: 5\n3. Non-teachers: 11 - 5 = 6\n4. Subcommittee size: 4\n5. Cases:\n   a) Exactly one non-teacher: Choose 1 non-teacher from 6, and 3 teachers from 5.  (6 choose 1) * (5 choose 3) = 6 * 10 = 60\n   b) Exactly two non-teachers: Choose 2 non-teachers from 6, and 2 teachers from 5. (6 choose 2) * (5 choose 2) = 15 * 10 = 150\n   c) Exactly three non-teachers: Choose 3 non-teachers from 6, and 1 teacher from 5. (6 choose 3) * (5 choose 1) = 20 * 5 = 100\n   d) Exactly four non-teachers: Choose 4 non-teachers from 6, and 0 teachers from 5. (6 choose 4) * (5 choose 0) = 15 * 1 = 15\n6. Total distinct subcommittees: 60 + 150 + 100 + 15 = 325\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{325}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \\choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \\choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \\boxed{325}$."
