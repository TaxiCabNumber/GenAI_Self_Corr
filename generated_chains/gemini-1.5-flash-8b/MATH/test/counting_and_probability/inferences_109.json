In how many ways can she choose three of the locations to visit (the order in which she visits them does not matter)?",

This is a combination problem.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 locations from 5 is given by the combination formula:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nIn this case, $n = 5$ and $k = 3$.\n$$ \\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)(2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 $$\nThus, there are 10 ways Mary can choose three locations to visit.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
