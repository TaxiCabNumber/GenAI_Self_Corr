At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can one write the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in a row so that given any number in the row, all of its divisors (not including itself) appear to its left?",
        "inference": "1. The number 6 has divisors 1, 2, 3.  Thus, 1, 2, 3 must be to the left of 6.\n2. The number 4 has divisors 1, 2. Thus, 1, 2 must be to the left of 4.\n3. The number 3 has divisor 1. Thus, 1 must be to the left of 3.\n4. The number 2 has divisor 1. Thus, 1 must be to the left of 2.\n5. The number 5 has only divisor 1. Thus, 1 must be to the left of 5.\n6. The number 1 has no divisors.\n7. Combining the above, we must have the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or any permutation of this sequence where the divisors are to the left of the number they divide.\n8. The constraints imply that the divisors of a given number must be to its left.  The order must be such that divisors of each number are to the left of that number.  This implies that the divisors of each number must precede it in the sequence.\n\nConsider the given numbers and their divisors:\n- 6: 1, 2, 3\n- 4: 1, 2\n- 3: 1\n- 2: 1\n- 5: 1\n- 1: no divisors\n\nThe only possible arrangement is one where all the divisors of a number are to its left.  1 must be to the left of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so 1 must be the first number.  Then, 2 must be to the right of 1 and its divisor 1.  3 must be to the right of 1 and 2, and its divisor 1.  4 must be to the right of 1, 2, and its divisor 1.  5 must be to the right of 1 and its divisor 1.  6 must be to the right of 1, 2, 3, and its divisors 1, 2, 3.\n\nTherefore, the only arrangement satisfying the condition is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by finding all possible ways to arrange the 1, 2, 3, and 6.  There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\\boxed{25}$ orderings in all."
