How many of these small cubes touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box?",

The answer is the total number of cubes minus the ones in the interior. The cubes in the interior do not touch the bottom or the sides.  The number of cubes in the interior of a $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ cube is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nThe cubes on the bottom and sides are $64 - 8 = 56$.  That is incorrect. The cubes that touch the sides or bottom are $16+48=64$.\nThe interior cubes are $2\\times2\\times2 = 8$.\n\nThe cubes that touch the bottom are $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nThe cubes that touch the sides are $4 \\times (4 \\times 3) = 4 \\times 12 = 48$.\nThe cubes that touch both the bottom and a side (corner cubes) are counted twice.\nThus, the total is $16+48 = 64$.\nThe interior cubes are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\nThe number of cubes that touch the bottom or a side is $64 - 8 = 56$.  Incorrect logic.\nThe total number of cubes is $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$.\nThe cubes that touch only the bottom are $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nThe cubes that touch only the sides are $4 \\times 12 = 48$.\nThe cubes that touch both the bottom and the sides are $4 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nCubes that touch the bottom: $4 \\times 4 = 16$\nCubes that touch the sides: $4 \\times (4 \\times 3) = 48$.\nCubes that touch the bottom and a side: $4 \\times 12 = 48$\nThe corner cubes are counted twice.\nSo there are $4 \\times 3 = 12$\nSo the total number of cubes touching the bottom or sides is $16 + 48 - 8 = 56$.  Incorrect again.\nThe cubes in the interior are $(4-2)(4-2)(4-2) = (2)(2)(2) = 8$.\nThe number of cubes touching the bottom or sides is $64-8 = 56$.\nThe cubes touching the bottom are $16$.\nThe cubes touching the sides are $4 \\times 12 = 48$.\nThere are 8 cubes touching the bottom and sides (the corner cubes).\nThe answer is $16 + 4 \\times 12 = 16+48 = 64$.  There are no interior cubes to subtract.\nThe number of interior cubes is $2\\times 2\\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe cubes touching the bottom or side is $64 - 8 = 56$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$",
