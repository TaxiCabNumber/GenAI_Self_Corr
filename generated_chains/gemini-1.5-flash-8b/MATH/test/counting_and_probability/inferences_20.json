At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. First, we choose 6 people out of 7 to sit at the table. This can be done in $\\binom{7}{6} = 7$ ways.\n\n2. Now we arrange the 6 chosen people around the circular table.  The number of ways to arrange n objects in a circle is (n-1)! .\nThus, the number of ways to arrange 6 people around a circular table is (6-1)! = 5! = 120.\n\n3. Combining the two steps, we have 7 choices for the set of 6 people, and for each choice, there are 120 ways to arrange them around the table.  Thus, the total number of ways is $7 \\times 120 = 840$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{840}$\n",
