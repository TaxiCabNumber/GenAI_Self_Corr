At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChris wants to put six plants in a row on his windowsill. He randomly chooses each plant to be an aloe plant, a basil plant, or a violet. What is the probability that either exactly four of the plants are aloe plants or exactly five of the plants are basil plants?",
        "inference": "There are 3 choices for each of the 6 plants (aloe, basil, or violet). So there are $3^6 = 729$ total possible arrangements.\n\nIf exactly four plants are aloe plants, we need to choose which 4 plants are aloe plants. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$ ways. For each of these ways, the remaining 2 plants must be either basil or violet, so there are $2^2 = 4$ ways for those 2 plants. Thus there are $15 \\times 4 = 60$ arrangements with exactly 4 aloe plants.\n\nIf exactly 5 plants are basil plants, we need to choose which 5 plants are basil plants. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{5} = \\frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6$ ways. For each of these ways, the remaining 1 plant must be either aloe or violet, so there are $2^1 = 2$ ways for that plant. Thus there are $6 \\times 2 = 12$ arrangements with exactly 5 basil plants.\n\nThe number of arrangements with either exactly 4 aloe plants or exactly 5 basil plants is $60 + 12 = 72$.\n\nThe probability is $\\frac{72}{729} = \\frac{8}{81}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{81}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "It is impossible for Chris to have both four aloe plants and five basil plants, so first we consider the case of four aloe plants.
