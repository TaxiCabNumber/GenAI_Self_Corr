        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4?",
        "inference": "The first three digits must be greater than 4.  This means the first three digits can be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  There are 5 choices for each of the first three digits. The last two digits can be any digit from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each of the last two digits.  Therefore, the total number of such zip codes is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 12500$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12500}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are five digits greater than $4$ (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and each of the first three zip code digits could be any of them. Hence, there are $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 125$ ways to choose the first three digits. The last two zip code digits have no restrictions, so there are $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $125 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{12500}$ such zip codes."
