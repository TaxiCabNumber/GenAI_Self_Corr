At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMaria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
        "inference": "1. We have 3 apples and 3 oranges.\n2. We want to distribute them among 4 friends.\n3. Jacky doesn't get any oranges.\n4. We can distribute the 3 apples in $4^3$ ways, since each apple can go to any of the 4 friends.\n5. We have 3 oranges left to distribute among the 3 remaining friends (since Jacky doesn't get any).\n6. We can distribute the 3 oranges among 3 friends in $3^3$ ways.\n7. The total number of ways to distribute the fruits is the product of the ways to distribute the apples and the ways to distribute the oranges, which is $4^3 \\times 3^3 = 64 \\times 27 = 1728$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$."
