At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with 12 regular pentagonal faces and 20 vertices.  If two distinct vertices are chosen at random, what is the probability that the line connecting them lies inside the dodecahedron?",
        "inference": "1. Total number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 20 is $\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190$.\n\n2. A line connecting two vertices lies entirely inside the dodecahedron if and only if the two vertices are not adjacent on any of the faces.\nTwo vertices are adjacent if they share a face.\nEach pentagon has 5 vertices, so there are 12 faces and each face has 5 vertices.  For each vertex, there are 5 adjacent vertices.\n\n3. The number of pairs of adjacent vertices is $12 \\times 5/2 = 30$.  (We divide by 2 to avoid double counting.)\n\n4. The number of pairs of vertices that do not lie on a common face is $190 - 30 = 160$.\n\n5. The probability that the line connecting two randomly chosen vertices lies inside the dodecahedron is $\\frac{160}{190} = \\frac{16}{19}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{19}}$.

When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.\n\nTherefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\\frac{100}{190}=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$$"
