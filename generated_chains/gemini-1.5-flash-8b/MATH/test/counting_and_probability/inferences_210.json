At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 42524 is a palindrome, because it reads the same backwards as forward. How many integer palindromes are between 10,000 and 70,000, and are even?",

The second digit 'b' can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  The last digit is determined by 'a'.\n\nThe integers are between 10000 and 70000.

If we are going to have an even integer, the units digit must be even.  This restricts the first digit to 2, 4 or 6.  Then, there are 10 choices for the next (thousands) digit.
