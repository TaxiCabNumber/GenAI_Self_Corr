At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. and Mrs. Lopez have three children.  When they get into their family car, two people sit in the front, and the other three sit in a row in the back.  Either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must sit in the driver's seat, and their youngest child is not allowed to sit in the other front seat.  How many seating arrangements are possible?",
        "inference": "1. Mr. or Mrs. Lopez can sit in the driver's seat.  This gives 2 choices.\n2. Once the driver is chosen, there are 1 choice left for the passenger seat in the front.\n3. The remaining 3 children must sit in the back.  The youngest child cannot sit in the middle seat.  There are 3! ways to arrange 3 children in a row.\n   - If the youngest child sits in the left or right seat, there are 2 ways to sit the youngest child.  The remaining 2 children have 2! = 2 ways to sit in the middle two seats.  \n   - Thus, there are 2 * 2 = 4 ways for the children to sit in the back if the youngest sits in the left or right seat.\n   - If the youngest child sits in the middle seat, there are 2 ways to arrange the remaining 2 children in the other seats. Thus, there are 2 ways for the children to sit in the back if the youngest sits in the middle.\n4.  Total arrangements = (2 choices for driver) * (1 choice for front passenger) * (4 choices for arranging the children in the back) = 2 * 1 * 4 = 8.\n   \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat. After the driver is chosen, there are three remaining people who can sit in the other front seat. Then the three remaining people can sit in the back seats in any arrangement. There are three choices of people to sit in the first back seat, two choices of people to sit in the next back seat, and one person to sit in the last back seat. Therefore, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{36}$ possible seating arrangements."
