        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe letters of the word `SIXTEEN' are randomly arranged.  What is the probability that the two E's are not next to each other?",
        "inference": "1. Total arrangements of the letters in SIXTEEN:\nThere are 7 letters in total.  The letters are S, I, X, T, E, E, N.\nThe total number of arrangements is 7! / 2! = 2520 / 2 = 2520.  We divide by 2! because there are two E's.\n\n2. Arrangements where the two E's are together:\nTreat the two E's as a single unit.  We have 6 units to arrange (S, I, X, T, EN, E).\nThe number of arrangements is 6! = 720.\n\n3. Arrangements where the two E's are not together:\nSubtract the arrangements where the E's are together from the total arrangements.\n2520 - 720 = 1800.\n\n4. Probability:\nProbability = (Arrangements where E's are not together) / (Total arrangements)\nProbability = 1800 / 2520 = 5/7.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$."
