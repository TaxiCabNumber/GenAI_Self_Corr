By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.\n\nWe can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's.
