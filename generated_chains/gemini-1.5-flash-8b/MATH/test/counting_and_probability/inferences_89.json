At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose you have a weighted coin in which heads comes up with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  If you flip heads, you win 2 dollars, but if you flip tails, you lose 1 dollar.  What is the expected value of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal.",
