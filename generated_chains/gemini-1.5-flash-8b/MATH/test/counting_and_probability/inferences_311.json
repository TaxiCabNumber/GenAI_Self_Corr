At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the famous baseball player for the San Francisco Midgets, Larry Ponds, has a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance of earning a walk on each plate appearance, what is the probability that he will earn a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances?
