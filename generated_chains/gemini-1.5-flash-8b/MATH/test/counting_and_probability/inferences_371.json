I hope it is correct.'\nA deli sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of sauce. The deli offers wheat, rye, and white bread; ham, turkey, roast beef, and tuna; ranch and southwest chipotle sauce. Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce. He tells the server to assemble a random deli sandwich. What is the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction?",
