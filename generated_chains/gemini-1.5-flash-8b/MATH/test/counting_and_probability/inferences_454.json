At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe call a number a descending number if each digit is strictly smaller than the digit that comes before it.  For example, 863 is a descending number.  How many 3-digit descending numbers are there?",
        "inference": "To form a 3-digit descending number, we need to choose 3 digits from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} such that the digits are in descending order. The digits cannot be repeated. Since the digits are in descending order, the choice of digits uniquely determines the number.\n\nWe need to choose 3 distinct digits from the 10 possible digits. The number of ways to choose 3 distinct digits from 10 distinct digits is given by the combination formula $\\binom{10}{3}$.\n$\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3!7!} = \\frac{10\\times9\\times8}{3\\times2\\times1} = 10\\times3\\times4 = 120$.\n\nThus, there are 120 possible 3-digit descending numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For every 3 different digits, there is one corresponding descending number, which is just the digits in descending order.  So the answer is the number of combinations of three different digits, which is  $\\binom{10}{3} = \\boxed{120}$."
