At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Senate has 100 members, 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.  In how many ways can I choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose 3 Republicans from 55. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{55}{3} = \\frac{55!}{3!(55-3)!} = \\frac{55!}{3!52!} = \\frac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 55 \\times 9 \\times 53 = 26765$.\n2. We need to choose 2 Democrats from 45. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{45}{2} = \\frac{45!}{2!(45-2)!} = \\frac{45!}{2!43!} = \\frac{45 \\times 44}{2 \\times 1} = 45 \\times 22 = 990$.\n3. To find the total number of ways to choose the committee, we multiply the number of ways to choose the Republicans by the number of ways to choose the Democrats: $26765 \\times 990 = 26,529,150$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26529150}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 55 ways to choose the first Republican, 54 ways to choose the second Republican, and 53 ways to choose the third Republican; however, we must divide by $3!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose Republicans is $\\dfrac{55 \\times 54 \\times 53}{3!} = 26,\\!235$. There are 45 ways to choose the first Democrat and 44 ways to choose the second Democrat, but we must divide by $2!$ because order does not matter.  So the number of ways to choose the Democrats is $\\dfrac{45 \\times 44}{2!} = 990$.  So there are $26,\\!235 \\times 990 = \\boxed{25,\\!972,\\!650}$ ways to choose a committee."
