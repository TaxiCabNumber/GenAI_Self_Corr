At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMikka wants to order a pizza with two different toppings. He has 8 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could he order?",
        "inference": "Mikka has 8 choices for the first topping.\nAfter choosing the first topping, he has 7 remaining choices for the second topping.\nThe number of different pizzas he can order is the product of the number of choices for each topping.\nNumber of pizzas = 8 * 7 = 56\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of an 8 -element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${8 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{28}$ to compute this."
