        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMatt and Ryan are playing an exciting round of Rock Paper Scissors: The Collectible Card Game. Matt is convinced that Rock can beat anything, so his deck consists only of 8 Rock cards.   Ryan's deck consists of 5 Paper cards and 3 Scissors cards.  In the game, Matt randomly selects 3 cards from his deck and places them on the table.  Ryan then randomly selects 3 cards and places one on each of Matt's cards.  If Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock, then what's the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row?",
