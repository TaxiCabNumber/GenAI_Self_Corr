At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen flips a fair nickel four times. What is the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of getting a head on a single flip of a fair nickel is 1/2.\nThe probability of getting a tail on a single flip of a fair nickel is 1/2.\nThe probability of getting Head, Tail, Head, Tail in that order is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since any given flip has equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being a Head or a Tail, and all outcomes are equally likely, the precise sequence given is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$."
