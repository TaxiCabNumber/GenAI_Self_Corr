        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAli, Bonnie, Carlo and Dianna are going to drive together to a nearby theme park.  The car they are using has four seats: one driver's seat, one front passenger seat and two different back seats. Bonnie and Carlo are the only two who can drive the car. How many possible seating arrangements are there?",
        "inference": "1. Bonnie or Carlo can drive.  This gives 2 possibilities for the driver's seat.\n2. Once the driver is chosen, there are 3 people remaining for the front passenger seat.\n3. There are now 2 people remaining for the back left seat.\n4. The remaining person must sit in the back right seat.\n5. Multiply the possibilities for each seat: 2 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 2 choices for the driver.  The other three can seat themselves in $3\\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ different ways. So the number of seating arrangements is $2 \\times 6 =\\boxed{12}$."
