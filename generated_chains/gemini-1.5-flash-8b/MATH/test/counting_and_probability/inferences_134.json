At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLink is coloring a triforce, which consists of four equilateral triangles and is depicted below. He has three colors to use: gold, black, and green. So that it remains recognizable, he doesn't want to color any two triangles the same color if they share a side. How many different ways can he color the triforce? (Two colorings that differ by rotation are considered distinct.) [asy]\nsize(50);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(1,1.732)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1.5,.866)--(.5,.866)--cycle);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "1. The top triangle can be colored in 3 ways.\n2. The left triangle, sharing a side with the top triangle, can be colored in 2 ways.\n3. The right triangle, sharing a side with the top triangle, can be colored in 2 ways.\n4. The bottom triangle, sharing a side with both left and right triangles, can be colored in 2 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to color the triforce is $3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 ways to choose a color for the center.  Once the center color is chosen, for each of the remaining triangles there are 2 ways to choose a color (any color except the center color).
