At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are eight boys and six girls who are members of the trumpet section in the band. From the members of the trumpet section, a quintet is being formed. If the quintet must consist of three boys and two girls, how many quintets are possible?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose 3 boys out of 8. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$.\n2. We need to choose 2 girls out of 6. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$.\n3. To find the total number of possible quintets, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls: $56 \\times 15 = 840$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{840}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we consider how many ways there are to choose three boys from eight. There are $8$ choices for the first boy, $7$ for the second, and $6$ for the third. However, because the boys are indistinct from one another, we have overcounted, and must divide by $3 \\cdot 2$. Similarly, there are $6 \\cdot 5$ ways to choose the two girls, divided by $2$ for overcounting. Thus, there are $\\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\boxed{840}$ possible quintets."
