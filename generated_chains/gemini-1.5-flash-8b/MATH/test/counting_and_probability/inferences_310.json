Since the dice are fair, the probability of each outcome is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nThe expected value of $X_1$ is $E(X_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^8 i \\cdot P(X_1=i) = \\sum_{i=1}^8 i \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{i=1}^8 i = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{8 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\frac{36}{8} = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5$.\nSimilarly, the expected value of $X_2$ is $E(X_2) = 4.5$.\n\nThe sum of the two rolls is $S = X_1 + X_2$.\nThe expected value of $S$ is $E(S) = E(X_1 + X_2) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) = 4.5 + 4.5 = 9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
