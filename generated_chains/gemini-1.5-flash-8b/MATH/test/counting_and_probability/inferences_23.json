At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that I have an unlimited supply of identical math books, history books, and physics books.  All are the same size, and I have room on a shelf for 8 books.  In how many ways can I arrange eight books on the shelf if no two books of the same type can be adjacent?",
        "inference": "1. Let $m$ be the number of math books, $h$ be the number of history books, and $p$ be the number of physics books. We are given that $m+h+p=8$. We want to find the number of solutions where no two books of the same type are adjacent.\n\n2. First, let's find the total number of ways to arrange 8 books without any restrictions. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to $m+h+p=8$ where $m, h, p \\ge 0$. This is a stars and bars problem. The number of solutions is $\\binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\times 9}{2} = 45$.\n\n3. Now, consider the case where two math books are adjacent. We treat these two math books as a single unit. Then we have 7 units to arrange: 2 math books (as one unit), 1 history book, 1 physics book.\nThis is equivalent to arranging 7 units, which can be done in $\\binom{7+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9\\times 8}{2} = 36$ ways.\nThe same is true for two history books and two physics books. So, there are $3 \\times 36 = 108$ ways where two books of the same type are adjacent.\n\n4. Now consider the case where there are three math books adjacent. Treat these 3 math books as a single unit. We have 6 units to arrange: 3 math books (as one unit), 1 history book, 1 physics book. This gives $\\binom{6+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8\\times 7}{2} = 28$ ways. Same for history books and physics books. This gives $3 \\times 28 = 84$ ways.\n\n5.
