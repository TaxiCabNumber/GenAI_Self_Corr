        "inference": "1. A hole at $x=-2$ means $(x+2)$ is a factor of both the numerator and denominator.  The numerator is $4x-x^3 = -x(x^2-4) = -x(x-2)(x+2)$. So the denominator must also have $(x+2)$ as a factor.  Let $q(x) = (x+2)(ax^2+bx+c)$.\n\n2. A vertical asymptote at $x=1$ means $(x-1)$ must be a factor of the denominator, but not the numerator. So $q(x) = (x+2)(x-1)(ax+b)$ where $(x-1)$ is not a factor of $-x(x-2)(x+2)$.\n\n3. No horizontal asymptote means the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same.  The numerator has degree 3, so the denominator must also have degree 3.  The numerator is $-x(x-2)(x+2)$, which is already in factored form.\n\n4. The denominator factors to $(x+2)(x-1)(ax+b)$.\nComparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator, we need the $x^3$ terms to cancel, so $a=-1$.\nThus $q(x) = (x+2)(x-1)(-x+b)$.\nWe have $q(x) = -x^3 + bx^2 - x^2 + bx - 2x + 2b = -x^3 + (b-1)x^2 + (b-2)x + 2b$.\n\n5. To have a hole at $x=-2$, we must have $x+2$ as a factor in both the numerator and denominator. The numerator is $-x^3 +4x$.\nThe expression $\\frac{4x-x^3}{q(x)}$ has a hole at $x=-2$, so $(x+2)$ is a factor of the numerator. \n$q(x) = (x+2)(x-1)(-x+b) = (x^2+x-2)(-x+b) = -x^3 + bx^2 - x^2 + bx + 2x - 2b = -x^3 + (b-1)x^2 + (b+2)x - 2b$.\n\n\n6. Since $q(3) = -30$, we plug in $x=3$ into the expression for $q(x)$:\n$-3^3 + (b-1)(3)^2 + (b+2)(3) - 2b = -27 + (b-1)(9) + 3b + 6 - 2b = -27 + 9b - 9 + 3b + 6 - 2b = 9b - 20 - 27 + 3b + 6 = 12b - 41 = -30$.\n$12b = 11$, $b = \\frac{11}{12}$.\n$q(x) = (x+2)(x-1)(-x+\\frac{11}{12}) = (x^2+x-2)(-\\frac{12x}{12}+\\frac{11}{12}) = (x^2+x-2)(-\\frac{12x+11}{12}) = \\frac{-(x^2+x-2)(12x+11)}{12} = \\frac{-(12x^3 + 11x^2 + 12x^2 + 11x - 24x - 22)}{12} = \\frac{-(12x^3 + 23x^2 - 13x - 22)}{12}$.\n\n\n7. $q(x) = -x^2-x+2$\n\n$q(x) = -(x+2)(x-1)(x - \\frac{11}{12}) = -\\frac{1}{12}(x+2)(x-1)(12x-11)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{12}(x+2)(x-1)(12x-11)}$",
