        "inference": "The equation of the ellipse is $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$.  Since $P = (-1, 0)$, we have $4(-1)^2 + 0^2 = 4$, so $P$ lies on the ellipse. Let $Q = (x, y)$ be another point on the ellipse. The distance between $P$ and $Q$ is given by the distance formula:\n$d^2 = (x-(-1))^2 + (y-0)^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2$.\nSince $Q$ lies on the ellipse, $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$. Thus $y^2 = 4 - 4x^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $d^2$, we get\n$d^2 = (x+1)^2 + (4 - 4x^2) = x^2 + 2x + 1 + 4 - 4x^2 = -3x^2 + 2x + 5$.\nTo maximize $d^2$, we need to find the vertex of the parabola $f(x) = -3x^2 + 2x + 5$. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{2}{2(-3)} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe maximum value of $d^2$ occurs when $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.

        "inference": "The problem asks for the maximum distance between point $P(-1, 0)$ and a point $Q(x, y)$ on the ellipse $4x^2 + y^2 = 4$. We want to maximize the distance $d = \\sqrt{(x-(-1))^2 + (y-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2}$. Squaring to get $d^2$, we have\n$d^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2$. Substituting $y^2 = 4 - 4x^2$, we have\n$d^2 = (x+1)^2 + 4 - 4x^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + 4 - 4x^2 = -3x^2 + 2x + 5$.\nTo find the maximum value, we take the derivative with respect to $x$:\n$\\frac{d(d^2)}{dx} = -6x + 2$. Setting this equal to 0, we get $-6x + 2 = 0$, which implies $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nNow we check the second derivative: $\\frac{d^2(d^2)}{dx^2} = -6 < 0$, which confirms that this corresponds to a maximum.\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ into the equation for $d^2$, we get\n$d^2 = -3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) + 5 = -3\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) + \\frac{2}{3} + 5 = -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} + 5 = \\frac{1}{3} + 5 = \\frac{16}{3}$.\nThus, the maximum distance is $\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{3}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe maximum distance squared is $\\frac{16}{3}$.  The maximum distance is $\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{3}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The question asks for the maximum distance squared, so the answer is $\\frac{16}{3}$.\n\n$\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$\n",
