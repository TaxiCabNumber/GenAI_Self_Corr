At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMatt and Marie are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Matt chooses the point $1-4i$. Marie chooses $-4+2i$. How far apart are Marie and Matt's points?",
        "inference": "To find the distance between the points $1-4i$ and $-4+2i$ on the complex plane, we can use the distance formula, which is the same as the distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in the coordinate plane.  The distance between $z_1 = x_1 + y_1i$ and $z_2 = x_2 + y_2i$ is given by $|z_1 - z_2| = \\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$.\n\nIn this case, $z_1 = 1-4i$ and $z_2 = -4+2i$.  So $x_1 = 1$, $y_1 = -4$, $x_2 = -4$, and $y_2 = 2$.\n\nThe distance is $\\sqrt{(1 - (-4))^2 + (-4 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(1+4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{(5)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 36} = \\sqrt{61}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{61}}$\n",
