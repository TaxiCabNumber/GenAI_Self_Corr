        "inference": "Let $z=x+iy$. Then $\\bar{z}=x-iy$.\nSubstituting into the given equation, we have\n$3(x+iy) + 4i(x-iy) = 1-8i$\n$3x+3iy+4ix-4i^2y=1-8i$\n$3x+3iy+4ix+4y=1-8i$\n$3x+4y+(3y+4x)i=1-8i$\nComparing real and imaginary parts, we have the system of equations:\n$3x+4y=1$\n$3y+4x=-8$\nMultiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4:\n$9x+12y=3$\n$12y+16x=-32$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get\n$12y+16x - (9x+12y) = -32-3$\n$7x=-35$\n$x=-5$\nSubstituting $x=-5$ into the first equation:\n$3(-5)+4y=1$\n$-15+4y=1$\n$4y=16$\n$y=4$\nTherefore, $z=x+iy=-5+4i$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-5+4i}$",
        "ground_truth": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $4i\\bar{z}=4b+4ia$.  We now find that \\[ 3z+4i\\bar{z} = (3a+4b) + (4a+3b)i. \\]So if $3z+4i\\bar{z}=1-8i$ then we must have $3a+4b=1$ and $4a+3b=-8$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=-5$ and $b=4$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{-5+4i}$."
