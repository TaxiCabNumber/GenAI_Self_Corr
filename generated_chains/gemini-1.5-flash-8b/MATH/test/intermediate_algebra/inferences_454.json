        "inference": "The given information is $e(x) + x^2 = o(x)$.\nWe are given that $e(x)$ is an even function and $o(x)$ is an odd function.\nSubstituting $-x$ into the given equation, we get $e(-x) + (-x)^2 = o(-x)$. Since $e(x)$ is even, $e(-x) = e(x)$. Also, since $o(x)$ is odd, $o(-x) = -o(x)$.\nThus, $e(x) + x^2 = o(x)$ and $e(x) + x^2 = -o(-x) = -o(x)$, so $o(x) = -o(x)$.\nThis implies $2 o(x) = 0$, which means $o(x) = 0$ for all $x$.\nTherefore, $e(x) + x^2 = 0$, so $e(x) = -x^2$.\nThen $f(x) = e(x) + o(x) = -x^2 + 0 = -x^2$.\nWe are asked to find $f(2)$.\n$f(2) = -(2^2) = -4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$",
