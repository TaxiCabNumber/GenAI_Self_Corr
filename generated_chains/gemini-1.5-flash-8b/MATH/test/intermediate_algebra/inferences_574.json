Let $2a$ be the length of the major axis of the ellipse, and $c$ be the distance from the center to each focus. We have $2a = 15$, so $a = \\frac{15}{2}$.

Since the circle passes through $F_1$ and $F_2$, the distance between the foci is the diameter of the circle, which is equal to $2c$. The distance between the foci is given by $2c = |F_1 F_2|$. We know that $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, where $b$ is the length of the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. We have $\\frac{1}{2} \\times |F_1 F_2| \\times h = 26$. Since $F_1 F_2 = 2c$ is the diameter of the circle, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2c \\times h = 26$.  $c \\times h = 26$, and the height is perpendicular to the segment $F_1 F_2$.

We have $\\frac{1}{2} \\times F_1 F_2 \\times h = 26$. The segment connecting $P$ to $F_1$ and $F_2$ is the radius of the circle, so the distance to the segment $F_1 F_2$ is the radius of the circle.

The radius of the circle is $r$, and $r = c$. Then $ch = 26$ gives $c^2 = 26$.\n\n$F_1 F_2 = 2c$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{2} (2c) (2r) = 26$.

        "inference": "Given that the area of $\\triangle PF_1F_2$ is 26, and the segment $F_1F_2$ is a diameter of the circle, $F_1F_2 = 2c$. The altitude from $P$ to $F_1F_2$ is the radius $r$ of the circle.  Thus, $\\frac{1}{2}(2c)r = 26$, which gives $cr = 26$.  We are also given that $2a=15$, so $a=7.5$.  Since $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, we have $7.5^2 = b^2 + c^2$.  Since $P$ lies on both the ellipse and the circle, we know that the distance from the center to $P$ is $r$.  Thus $r^2 = a^2 - b^2$. However, the problem is not clearly stating the relation between $h$ and $r$.\n\nThe given area formula $\\frac{1}{2}(2c)h = 26$ implies $ch=26$. The radius of the circle is $r$.  The altitude from $P$ to $F_1F_2$ is perpendicular, so the altitude from $P$ to $F_1F_2$ is the radius of the circle. Thus $r = h$. So $cr=26$.\n\nFrom the equation $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$, and $a=7.5$, we have $7.5^2 = b^2 + c^2$.  Since $r=h$, $cr=26 \\implies c^2 = \\frac{676}{c^2} = 26$.  Then $c \\times r = 26$.  Since $r = c$, we have $c^2=26$.  $r^2 = c^2$, so $r=c$.  Then $r^2 = c^2 = 26$.\n\n\nBy Pythagoras theorem,  $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$.\n$7.5^2 = b^2 + c^2$. Since $ch=26$ and $r=h$, we have $cr = 26$.\n$a^2 = b^2+c^2$\n$c^2 = 7.5^2 - b^2$\n$cr=26$ implies $r=c$.  Thus $c^2=26$.  \n$r = \\sqrt{26}$, $7.5^2 = \\sqrt{26}^2+ b^2$.  $56.25 = 26+b^2$. $b^2 = 30.25$  $b = 5.5$.\n$ch = 26$ with $c=h=r$, $c^2 = 26$.  So $c = \\sqrt{26}$, $r=c=\\sqrt{26}$.\n\n\nIf $h=r$, then $cr=26$. Since $c=r$, we have $c^2 = 26$.   $c=\\sqrt{26}$.\nSince the major axis is 15, $2a = 15$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$",
