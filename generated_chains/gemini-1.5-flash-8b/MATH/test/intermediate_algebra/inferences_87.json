At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many different values of $x$ does $x^5 = x^4 + 72x^3$?",

We can factor this quadratic as\n$(x-9)(x+8) = 0$.\nThis gives us two solutions: $x-9=0$ which means $x=9$, and $x+8=0$ which means $x=-8$.\nThus, the values of $x$ are $0, 9, -8$.\nThere are 3 different values of $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
