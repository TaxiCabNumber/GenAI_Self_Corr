Thus, it has two roots given by $x=\\frac{8\\pm\\sqrt{12}}{2}=\\frac{8\\pm2\\sqrt{3}}{2}=4\\pm\\sqrt{3}$.

The first case is equivalent to $x>1$ and $x<7$, which is $1<x<7$. The second case is equivalent to $x<1$ and $x>7$, which has no solution.\nThus, $(x-1)(x-7)<0$ is $1<x<7$.\n\nWe need $x^2-8x+13<0$ and $(x-1)(x-7)<0$ or $x^2-8x+13>0$ and $(x-1)(x-7)>0$.\nThe first case is $4-\\sqrt{3} < x < 4+\\sqrt{3}$ and $1<x<7$.

This gives $1<x<4+\\sqrt{3}\\approx5.732$. Also, $4-\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.268$. The intersection of intervals $(1, 7)$ and $(2.268, 5.732)$ is $(2.268, 5.732)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(1, 7)}$",
