At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSasha and Chloe are throwing darts at a map of the complex plane. Sasha's dart lands on the point $15+8i$. Chloe's dart lands on the point $3-4i$. How much closer to the origin is Chloe's dart compared to Sasha's?",

The distance from the origin to Sasha's dart is $\\sqrt{15^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{225+64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$.\n\nChloe's dart lands on the point $3-4i$.
