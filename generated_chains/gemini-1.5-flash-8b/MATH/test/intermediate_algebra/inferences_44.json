        "inference": "The provided solution has some errors. Let's correct them.\n\n1. A hole occurs when a common factor exists in both the numerator and denominator.\n\n2.  The numerator is correctly factored as $3x^2 + 16x + 5 = (3x + 1)(x + 5)$.\n\n3. Since there's a hole at $x = -5$, $(x+5)$ is a factor in both the numerator and denominator.  The denominator can be written as $(x+5)(ax + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\n4. Expanding the denominator gives $(x+5)(ax+b) = ax^2 + (a+5b)x + 5b$. Comparing this to the given denominator $2x^2 + 7x - c$, we get the equations:\n   * $a = 2$\n   * $a+5b = 7 \\implies 2+5b = 7 \\implies 5b = 5 \\implies b=1$\n   * $5b = -c \\implies 5(1) = -c \\implies c = -5$\n\n5. The factored form of the rational function is $\\frac{(3x+1)(x+5)}{(x+5)(2x+1)} = \\frac{3x+1}{2x+1}$.\n\n6. The vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator is zero and the numerator is nonzero.
