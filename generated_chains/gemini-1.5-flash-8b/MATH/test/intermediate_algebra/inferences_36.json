        "ground_truth": "Solution #1\n\nTo determine the range, we suppose $y=\\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ (where $x\\ne -8$) and see if we can solve for $x$:\n$$\\begin{array}{r r@{~=~}l}\n& y & (3x+1)/(x+8) \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & y(x + 8) & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & yx + 8y & 3x + 1 \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow & x(y - 3) & 1 - 8y.\n\\end{array}$$This last equation gives a contradiction if $y=3$, since in this case it says that $0=-23$.
