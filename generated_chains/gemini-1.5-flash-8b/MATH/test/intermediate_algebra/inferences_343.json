At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ have?",
        "inference": "To find the vertical asymptotes of the function $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.\nThe denominator is $x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 = (x-1)^3$.\nSetting the denominator equal to zero gives us $(x-1)^3 = 0$, which means $x = 1$.\nThe numerator is 1, which is non-zero.\nThus, $x=1$ is the only value that makes the denominator zero.\nSince $(x-1)^3$ is the denominator, the factor $(x-1)$ is repeated three times, and the function has a vertical asymptote at $x=1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = (x-1)^3$. The function can be written as  $y = \\frac{1}{(x-1)^3}$. Vertical asymptotes occur at values of $x$ where the denominator is 0. In this case, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote, which occurs where $x = 1$."
