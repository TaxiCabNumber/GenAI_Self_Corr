        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $y=\\frac{27x^2+9x+3}{27x^3+9x^2+3x+1}$, at what value of $y$ will there be a horizontal asymptote?",
        "inference": "To find the horizontal asymptote of the function $y=\\frac{27x^2+9x+3}{27x^3+9x^2+3x+1}$, we analyze the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\nThe numerator is a polynomial of degree 2, and the denominator is a polynomial of degree 3.\nSince the degree of the denominator (3) is greater than the degree of the numerator (2), the horizontal asymptote is at $y=0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a rational function, when the degree of the numerator is smaller than the degree of the denominator, the denominator grows at a faster rate than the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a degree of 2 while the denominator has a degree of 3. Thus, the function approaches the asymptote $y=\\boxed{0}$."
