        "inference": "$f(-x) = 3^{-x} = \\frac{1}{3^x}$\n\nIf $f(x)$ is even, $f(-x) = f(x)$, which is $\\frac{1}{3^x} = 3^x$. This implies $3^x = \\frac{1}{3^x}$, so $(3^x)^2 = 1$.  This means $3^x = 1$ or $3^x = -1$.  The equation $3^x = -1$ has no real solution, so $3^x = 1$ implies $x=0$.  Thus, $f(x) = 3^x$ is not even.\n\nIf $f(x)$ is odd, $f(-x) = -f(x)$, which is $\\frac{1}{3^x} = -3^x$. This implies $1 = -3^{2x}$, which is impossible.  Thus, $f(x) = 3^x$ is not odd.\n\nTherefore, $f(x) = 3^x$ is neither even nor odd.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{neither}$",
