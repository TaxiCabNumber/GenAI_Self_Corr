Since $r^3 = 343$, we have $r = \\sqrt[3]{343} = 7$.\nIf $r$ is a root of $x^2 + ax + b = 0$, then $r^2 + ar + b = 0$.\nWe know $r = 7$, so $7^2 + a(7) + b = 0$. This gives $49 + 7a + b = 0$.\nThus $b = -49 - 7a$.\n\nThe quadratic equation has a non-real root.  This means the discriminant must be negative.\nThe discriminant of $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ is $a^2 - 4b$.\nSince $b = -49-7a$, we have\n$a^2 - 4(-49-7a) = a^2 + 196 + 28a$.\nThe discriminant must be negative. So $a^2 + 28a + 196 < 0$.\nWe complete the square: $(a+14)^2 - 196 + 196 < 0$.\n$(a+14)^2 < 0$.\nBut $(a+14)^2$ is always non-negative. The only way this inequality can hold is if $a+14=0$, which means $a=-14$.\nNow we find $b = -49 - 7a = -49 - 7(-14) = -49 + 98 = 49$.\nSo the quadratic equation is $x^2 - 14x + 49 = 0$.\nThe roots are $(x-7)^2 = 0$, so $x = 7$.\nWe have $7^3 = 343$, which is a real number.\nSince the root $r$ is non-real, we need a complex root $r = 7$.  This means that $x-7$ is a factor of $x^2+ax+b$, so $x^2+ax+b = (x-7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49$. Then $a=-14$ and $b=49$.\nLet $r$ be the non-real root. If $r = 7e^{i\\theta}$, then $7^3e^{i3\\theta} = 343 = 7^3$, which means $e^{i3\\theta} = 1$. Then $3\\theta = 2\\pi n$ for some integer $n$. This implies that $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi n}{3}$.  When $n=0$, $\\theta = 0$ (real root), which is not allowed.\n\n$x^2-14x+49 = 0 \\Rightarrow (x-7)^2=0$.  The roots are $7, 7$.  So there is no non-real root.\nIf $x = 7, x^2 - 14x + 49 = 0$\nIf $a=-14$ and $b=49$, $x^2 - 14x + 49 = (x-7)^2$, so $x=7$ twice.\n\nThus the problem has no solution.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{no solution}$",
