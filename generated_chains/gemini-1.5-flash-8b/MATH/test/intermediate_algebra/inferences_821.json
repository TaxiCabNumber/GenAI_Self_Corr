        "inference": "Line $l_1$ is $l$ shifted 3 units to the left and 2 units downward.\nThe equation of $l_1$ is $y = a(x+3) - 2$.\nSince $l_1$ passes through $(5,8)$, we have $8 = a(5+3) - 2$, which gives $8 = 8a - 2$, or $10 = 8a$, so $a = \\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nSince $l_1$ passes through $(7,14)$, we have $14 = a(7+3) - 2$, which gives $14 = 10a - 2$, or $16 = 10a$, so $a = \\frac{16}{10} = \\frac{8}{5}$.\nThe two values of $a$ are different, which means there is an error in the problem statement.\nSince $l_1$ passes through $(5,8)$ and $(7,14)$, the slope of $l_1$ is $m_1 = \\frac{14 - 8}{7 - 5} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3$.\nSo the equation of $l_1$ is $y = 3x + b_1$.\nSince $(5,8)$ is on the line, $8 = 3(5) + b_1$, so $8 = 15 + b_1$, which gives $b_1 = -7$.\nThe equation of $l_1$ is $y = 3x - 7$.\nThe equation of $l$ is $y = 3(x+3) - 7 - 2 = 3x + 9 - 7 - 2 = 3x + 0$, so $y=3x$.\nComparing with $y=ax+b$, we have $a=3$ and $b=0$.\n$a-b = 3-0=3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
        "ground_truth": "We find the equation of $l_1$ first. The slope of $l_1$ is \\[\\frac{14 - 8}{7-5} = 3.\\]Since $l_1$ passes through $5,8$, we can set $8 = 3(5) + t$ where $(0,t)$ is the $y$-intercept. Subtracting 15 from both sides, we find the $t = -7$, and so the $y$-intercept is $(0,-7)$. Thus, $l_1$ has equation $y = 3x - 7$.\n\nTo find the equation of the original line, we begin with line $l_1$ and shift it three units to the right and two units up. Recall that to shift the graph of an equation three units to the right we replace $x$ with $x-3$. Similarly, to shift two units up we replace $y$ with $y-2$. Making these substitutions, we obtain $y - 2 = 3(x - 3) + 7$, which is equivalent to $y= 3x - 14$. Thus, $a - b = 3 + 14 = \\boxed{17}$."
