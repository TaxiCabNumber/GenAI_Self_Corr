At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

This means the power of $(x-7)$ in the denominator must be the same as the power of $(x-7)$ in the numerator. In this case, the numerator has a $(x-7)^5$ term, so the denominator must also have a $(x-7)^5$ term.  Thus, $n = 5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$",
        "ground_truth": "The graph has a hole at $x = 7$ as long as there is at least one factor of $x - 7$ in the denominator, but at most five.  (If there were more than five, then there would be a vertical asymptote at $x = 7.$)  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$ possible values."
