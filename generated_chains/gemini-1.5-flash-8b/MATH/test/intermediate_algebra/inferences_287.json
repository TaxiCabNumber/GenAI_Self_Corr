At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA parabola has vertex of $(4,-5)$ and has two $x$-intercepts, one positive, and one negative.  If this parabola is the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c,$ which of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be positive?\n\nEnter the coefficients that must be positive, separated by commas.  For example, if you think $a$ and $c$ must be positive, enter \"$a,$ $c$\", without the quotation marks.",
        "inference": "Since the vertex is $(4,-5)$, the parabola opens either upward or downward. The parabola has two x-intercepts, one positive and one negative.  This means the parabola must intersect the x-axis in two points, one to the left of the y-axis and one to the right.  The vertex is a maximum if the parabola opens downward, and a minimum if the parabola opens upward. Since the parabola has two x-intercepts, one positive and one negative, the parabola must open upward.  Therefore, $a$ must be positive.\n\nThe equation of the parabola is $y = ax^2 + bx + c.$\nThe vertex form of a parabola is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.  In this case, $(h,k) = (4,-5)$, so $y = a(x-4)^2 - 5$.  Expanding this gives $y = a(x^2-8x+16) - 5 = ax^2 - 8ax + 16a - 5$.\nComparing this with $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we have $b = -8a$ and $c = 16a - 5.$\nSince the parabola opens upward, $a$ must be positive.\n$b = -8a$ implies that $b$ is negative since $a$ is positive.\n$c = 16a - 5$ implies that $c$ is positive since $a$ is positive.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{a, c}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$"

        "inference": "The problem states that the vertex is (4,-5), and the parabola has two x-intercepts, one positive and one negative.
