        "inference": "The polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{50}(x + 2k - 1)$ is given. We want to find the coefficient of $x^{49}$.\nThe coefficient of $x^{49}$ is given by $\\sum \\prod_{k=1}^{50} (2k-1)^{a_k}$, where the sum is taken over all non-negative integer solutions $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{50})$ of\n$$ a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{50} = 49 $$\nwhere $a_k \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for all $k=1, 2, \\dots, 50$.\n\nThus, the coefficient of $x^{49}$ is the sum of the products of terms with their corresponding exponents. We are interested in terms with exponents summing to 49.\nThus,\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{50} = 49 \\\\ a_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}}} \\prod_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1)^{a_i} $$\nThe only way to get a term with $x^{49}$ is if we choose 49 of the factors and take the $x$ term from the corresponding factor, and the other factors will contribute with $x^0$.\n\n$$ \\sum_{k_1 + k_2 + \\dots + k_{50} = 49} \\prod_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1)^{k_i} $$\nwhere each $k_i$ is either 0 or 1. The condition $a_1+a_2+...+a_{50} = 49$ implies we choose exactly 49 factors. This implies that for each $i$, we must have $a_i=1$ or $a_i=0$. In our case, we want to sum the choices $a_1, \\dots, a_{50}$ to be 49. This can happen in $\\binom{50}{49}$ ways, where we pick 49 factors.\nSince we can only choose 1 from each of the 50 possible factors, only one factor can have $a_i=1$. This leads to a term\n$$ (1)(3) \\dots (99) $$\n\nIf $k_1=49, k_2= \\dots=k_{50}=0$, then $\\prod_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1)^{k_i} = 1$. The terms in this case are $(1), (3), (5), \\dots, (99)$.\nWe have to select one term from each of the 50 terms in the product, with a total of 49 terms chosen.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{50} 2i - \\sum_{i=1}^{50} 1 = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{50} i - 50 = 2\\frac{50 \\times 51}{2} - 50 = 50 \\times 51 - 50 = 2550 $$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2550}$",
