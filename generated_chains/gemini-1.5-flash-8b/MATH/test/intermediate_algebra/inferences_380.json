        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the two functions $f(x) = x^2 + 2bx + 1$ and $g(x) = 2a(x + b),$ where the variables $x$ and the constants $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Each such pair of constants $a$ and $b$ may be considered as a point $(a,b)$ in an $ab$-plane.  Let $S$ be the set of points $(a,b)$ for which the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ do not intersect (in the $xy$-plane).  Find the area of $S.$",
        "inference": "For the graphs of $y=f(x)=x^2+2bx+1$ and $y=g(x)=2a(x+b)$ to not intersect, we must have $x^2 + 2bx + 1 \\neq 2a(x+b)$ for all $x$.  This means the quadratic $x^2 + 2bx + 1 - 2ax - 2ab = x^2 + (2b-2a)x + (1 - 2ab) = 0$ has no real roots.  For a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c=0$ to have no real roots, its discriminant must be negative.  Thus, we want\n$$(2b-2a)^2 - 4(1-2ab) < 0$$\n$$4b^2 - 8ab + 4a^2 - 4 + 8ab < 0$$\n$$4b^2 + 4a^2 - 4 < 0$$\n$$b^2 + a^2 < 1.$$\nThis is the interior of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin in the $ab$-plane. The area of this circle is $\\pi (1^2) = \\pi$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The graphs intersect when $f(x) = g(x)$ has a real root, or\n\\[x^2 + 2bx + 1 = 2a(x + b).\\]This simplifies to $x^2 + (2b - 2a) x + (1 - 2ab) = 0.$  Thus, we want this quadratic to have no real roots, which means its discriminant is negative:\n\\[(2b - 2a)^2 - 4(1 - 2ab) < 0.\\]This simplifies to $a^2 + b^2 < 1.$  This is the interior of the circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius 1, so its area is $\\boxed{\\pi}.$"
