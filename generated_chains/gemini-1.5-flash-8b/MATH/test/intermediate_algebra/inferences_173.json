Now, we square both sides of the inequality $\\sqrt{x^2 - x - 6} < 2x - 3$:\n   $x^2 - x - 6 < (2x - 3)^2$\n   $x^2 - x - 6 < 4x^2 - 12x + 9$\n   $0 < 3x^2 - 11x + 15$\n\n3. Now we need to find the roots of the quadratic $3x^2 - 11x + 15 = 0$.\n   The discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac = (-11)^2 - 4(3)(15) = 121 - 180 = -59$. Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic is always positive.\n\n4. Combining this with the domain restrictions from step 1, we need $x \\ge 3$.\n\n5. Now we check the endpoints for $x=3$:\n   $\\sqrt{3^2 - 3 - 6} = \\sqrt{0} = 0$ and $2(3)-3 = 3$, so $0 < 3$.\n   Thus, $x = 3$ is a solution.\n\n6.
