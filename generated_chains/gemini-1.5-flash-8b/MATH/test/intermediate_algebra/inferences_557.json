        "inference": "Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial. If $p(x)$ crosses the horizontal line $y=k$ at $n$ points, then $p(x) - k = 0$ has $n$ distinct real roots.\nThe problem states that $p(x)$ crosses $y=1$ at 1 point, $y=3$ at 3 points, and $y=5$ at 5 points.

Since $p(x)$ crosses the line $y=1$ at 1 point, the polynomial $p(x)-1$ has 1 real root, say $a$. Thus $p(a) = 1$. Similarly, $p(x)-3$ has 3 real roots, and $p(x)-5$ has 5 real roots.  Since $p(x)$ crosses the horizontal line $y=k$ at $n$ distinct points, we must have $p'(x) = 0$ at some values in between these crossings.\nConsider $p(x)-1=A_1(x-a)$, $p(x)-3=A_2(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)$, $p(x)-5=A_3(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\\cdots(x-c_5)$, where $A_1, A_2, A_3$ are nonzero constants.\nWe are looking for the smallest possible degree of $p(x)$ that would result in this behavior.  Since each polynomial must have the corresponding number of roots, the total number of roots is $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\nThus, the lowest degree of $p(x)$ must be at least $9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$",
