        "inference": "Let the side length of the square be $s$. The square is tangent to the circle at $(0,1)$. The center of the square is on the line $y = \\frac{1}{2}$, so the y-coordinate of the center is $1+\\frac{s}{2}$. The distance from the origin to the center of the square is $1+\\frac{s}{2}$.  The x-coordinate of the center is 0. Since the square is tangent to the circle, the distance from the origin to the center of the square must be $1+\\frac{s}{2} = \\sqrt{(s/2)^2 + (1/2)^2} \\implies 1+\\frac{s}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2+1}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{s^2+1}}{2} $.
