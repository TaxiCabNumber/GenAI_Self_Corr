        "inference": "The given function is $f(x) = 2000x^6+100x^5+10x^3+x-2$.  The derivative $f'(x) = 12000x^5+500x^4+30x^2+1$ is always positive, so $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing.  Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial and is monotonically increasing, it can have at most one real root.  The problem states there are two real roots, which is a contradiction.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.  It is not possible to have two real roots for a monotonically increasing function.\n\nThe problem likely meant to ask for the value of $(x_1 - x_2)^2$ given that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the roots of a polynomial of a different form.
