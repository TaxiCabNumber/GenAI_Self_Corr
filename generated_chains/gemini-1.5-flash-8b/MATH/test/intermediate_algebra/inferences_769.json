At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStacy has $d$ dollars. She enters a mall with $10$ shops and a lottery stall. First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",
