At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the following six statements:\n\n1. $x < x^2 < x^3$\n2. $x < x^3 < x^2$\n4. $x^2 < x < x^3$\n8. $x^2 < x^3 < x$\n16. $x^3 < x < x^2$\n32. $x^3 < x^2 < x$\n\n\nEnter the sum of the labels of statement that hold for some value of $x.$  For example, if you think the statements with labels 2 and 8 hold for some value of $x,$ then enter $2 + 8 = 10.$",
