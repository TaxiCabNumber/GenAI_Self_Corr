        "inference": "To find the maximum value of $f(x, y) = x^2 y - xy^2 = xy(x-y)$ subject to $0 \\le x \\le 1$ and $0 \\le y \\le 1$, we can consider the function $g(y) = y(1-y)$ for $0 \\le y \\le 1$. This is a parabola that opens downward, and its maximum occurs at $y=1/2$, where $g(1/2) = 1/2(1-1/2) = 1/4$. The maximum value of $f(x, y)$ is attained when $x=1$ and $y=1/2$, since in this case $xy(x-y) = 1(1/2)(1-1/2)=1/4$.  Also, the maximum value of $x-y$ is when $x=1$ and $y=0$, which gives $x-y=1$.\n\nThus, the maximum value is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$",
