It also seems to be assuming the asymptotes have a specific form, which is not stated. \n\nWithout knowing if the hyperbola opens horizontally or vertically, or the exact equation of the asymptotes, the solution is incorrect.\n\nTo find the correct solution, we need a complete graph or more information about the hyperbola's orientation and asymptotes. \n\nWithout that information, we cannot determine $a$ and $b$ correctly.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The problem cannot be solved without more information.",
