We want to minimize the average of the elements in $S$.\nTo minimize the average, we want to minimize the sum of the elements while maximizing the number of elements in $S$.\nWe can choose the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 2015\\}$ to maximize the number of elements, which is $2016$.\nThe sum of the elements in $S$ is\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{2015} i = \\frac{2015(2015+1)}{2} = \\frac{2015(2016)}{2} = 2015(1008) = 2031120. $$\nThe average is\n$$ \\frac{2031120}{2016} = 1007.5. $$\nTo minimize the average, we want to exclude the largest values from the sum and keep the number of elements as large as possible. If we exclude $2015$, we have\n$$ 0 + 1 + 2 + \\dots + 2014 = \\frac{2014(2015)}{2} = 2014(1007.5) = 2029109. $$\nThe average is\n$$ \\frac{2029109}{2015} \\approx 1007. $$\nHowever, we want the average to be as small as possible.  If we exclude the largest elements, the sum will be smaller.\nWe want to keep as many small elements as possible, so we need to select all the integers from 0 to some number $x$. The average will be smallest when $x$ is as small as possible.\nThe smallest average is when we include all integers from 0 to $x$, with the number of elements being $x+1$. We have $x+1 = 2016$ elements, and the sum is\n$$\\frac{x(x+1)}{2}$$\nWe can't choose all the elements from 0 to 2015, as we are looking for minimizing the average.\nThe minimum average occurs when we include $n$ elements, where $n$ is the largest possible integer less than $2016$.\nThe possible average is\n$$ \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i}{n} = \\frac{\\frac{(n-1)n}{2}}{n} = \\frac{n-1}{2} $$\nFor the largest possible number of elements, we choose all elements from 0 to $n-1$ for some $n$.\nThe average of the elements is minimized when $x = 0$ or $x = 1$.\nIf $n = 2016$, the sum is $2031120$, and the average is $1007.5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1007.5}$",
