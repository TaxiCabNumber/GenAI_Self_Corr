I hope it is correct.'\nIn the sequence $2001$, $2002$, $2003$, $\\ldots$ , each term after the third is found by subtracting the previous term from the sum of the two terms that precede that term. For example, the fourth term is $2001 + 2002 - 2003 = 2000$. What is the $2004^\\textrm{th}$ term in this sequence?",
