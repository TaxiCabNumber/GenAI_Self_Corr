        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the rational function $\\frac{2x^7-5x^4 + 3x^3 -x+5}{q(x)} $ has a horizontal asymptote. What is the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of the numerator is 7.\nFor a rational function to have a horizontal asymptote, the degree of the denominator must be at least as large as the degree of the numerator.\nThe degree of the numerator is 7.\nThe smallest possible degree of the denominator that will result in a horizontal asymptote is 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The numerator of the given function has degree $7$. Hence, if $q(x)$ has degree less than $7$, the function will have no horizontal asymptote. Therefore, the degree of $q(x)$ must be at least $7$. To see that $7$ works, we can consider $q(x) = x^7$. Then as $x$ grows away from $0$, the $x^7$ terms in the function will dominate and the function will tend towards $\\frac{2x^7}{x^7} = 2$. Thus the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
