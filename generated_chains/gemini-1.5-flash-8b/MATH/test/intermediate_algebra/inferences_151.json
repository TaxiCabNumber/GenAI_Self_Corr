At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than $2$.

        "inference": "Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than 2.\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree greater than 2, we can write\n$f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)q(x) + ax+b$.\n$f(1) = a(1) + b = 2 \\implies a+b=2$\n$f(2) = a(2) + b = 3 \\implies 2a+b=3$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we have:\n$2a+b - (a+b) = 3 - 2 \\implies a=1$.\nSubstitute $a=1$ into $a+b=2$, we have $1+b=2 \\implies b=1$.\nThe remainder is $ax+b = 1x+1 = x+1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x+1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $(x-1)(x-2)$ has degree $2$, we know the remainder has degree at most $1$, and thus is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Let $q(x)$ be the quotient. Then we have,\n$$f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)q(x)+ax+b.$$Substituting $x=1$ and $x=2$ gives us the equations:\n$$\\begin{aligned} f(1) &= 2 = a +b \\\\\nf(2) &= 3 = 2a+b \\end{aligned}$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $a=1$ and consequently, $b=1$. Hence the remainder is $\\boxed{x+1}$."
