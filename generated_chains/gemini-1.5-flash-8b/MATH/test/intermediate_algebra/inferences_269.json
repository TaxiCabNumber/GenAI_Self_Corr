The reflection of a point $(x, y)$ across the line $y = k$ is $(x, 2k-y)$.  Thus, the equation of the reflected parabola is obtained by replacing $y$ with $2k-y$.\n\n$2k - y = ax^2 + bx + c$\n$y = -ax^2 - bx - c + 2k$\n\nComparing this with $y = dx^2 + ex + f$, we have $d = -a$, $e = -b$, and $f = 2k-c$.\n\nWe want to find $a + b + c + d + e + f = a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (2k - c)$.\n$a + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (2k - c) = 2k$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2k}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
