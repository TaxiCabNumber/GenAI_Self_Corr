However, when its domain is restricted to $x \\in [c,\\infty),$ the function does become invertible, for certain values of $c.$  What is the smallest such value of $c$?",

The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola.  The parabola opens downward since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative. The vertex of the parabola is at $x = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{36}{2(-3)} = 6$.\nWhen $x=6$, $f(6) = -3(6)^2 + 36(6) - 7 = -3(36) + 216 - 7 = -108 + 216 - 7 = 101$.\nThe vertex is $(6, 101)$.\nThe function is decreasing on the interval $[6, \\infty)$.\nThus, the smallest value of $c$ for which $f(x)$ is invertible on $[c, \\infty)$ is $c = 6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
