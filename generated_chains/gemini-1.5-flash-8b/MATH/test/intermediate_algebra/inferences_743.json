Since the logarithm is only defined for positive arguments, we have $x^2 > 0$, which is true for all $x$ except $x=0$.  Thus the domain of the function is all real numbers except $0$, which can be written as $x < 0$ or $x > 0$.  Therefore, $a = 0$ and $b = 0$.\nThen $a + b = 0 + 0 = 0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
