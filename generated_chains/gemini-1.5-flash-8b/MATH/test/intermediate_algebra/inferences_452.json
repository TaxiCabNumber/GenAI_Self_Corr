        "inference": "The given information tells us the function has a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$, a vertical asymptote at $x=2$, a hole at $x=1$, and passes through the point $(2, 2/3)$.  Since the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$, the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator. The denominator is of the form $q(x) = a(x-2)(x-1)$ because of the vertical asymptote at $x=2$ and the hole at $x=1$.  We are given $q(-1)=18$, so $a(-1-2)(-1-1) = 18 \\implies 6a = 18 \\implies a = 3$. Thus, $q(x) = 3(x-2)(x-1) = 3x^2 - 9x + 6$.  The hole at $x=1$ means that $(x-1)$ is a factor of both the numerator and denominator, so the simplified form of the function is of the form $\\frac{k(x-1)}{3(x-2)(x-1)} = \\frac{k}{3(x-2)}$.\n\nThe function passes through $(2, 2/3)$. Substituting $x=2$, we get $\\frac{k}{3(2-2)} = \\frac{k}{0}$.  This means the point $(2, 2/3)$ must be on the simplified function. Therefore, $\\frac{k}{3(1-2)} = \\frac{k}{3(-1)} = \\frac{k}{-3} = \\frac{2}{3}$. This gives $k = -2$.\n\nThus, the function is $\\frac{-2(x-1)}{3(x-2)(x-1)} = \\frac{-2}{3(x-2)}$.  The numerator must be $-2(x-1) = -2x+2$. Therefore, the function is  $\\frac{-2x+2}{3x^2-9x+6}$. This is the same as $\\frac{-2(x-1)}{3(x-2)(x-1)}$. The function is $\\frac{-2}{3(x-2)}$. The question asks for $p(x) + q(x)$.  Thus, $p(x) = -2(x-1) = -2x + 2$. $q(x) = 3x^2-9x+6$.\nThen $p(x)+q(x) = (-2x+2) + (3x^2-9x+6) = 3x^2 - 11x + 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3x^2-11x+8}$",
