        "inference": "Let the parabola be $y = x^2 + bx + c$.\nThe parabola passes through $(-5,0)$. Substituting, we get $0 = (-5)^2 + b(-5) + c$, so $25 - 5b + c = 0$, which gives $c = 5b - 25$.\nThe $y$-intercept is $(0,c) = (0,5b-25)$.\nWe want to minimize the distance between the point $(12,3)$ and a point $(x,y)$ on the parabola. The distance is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x-12)^2 + (y-3)^2}$. Since $y = x^2 + bx + c$, we have $d = \\sqrt{(x-12)^2 + (x^2 + bx + c - 3)^2}$.\nTo minimize this distance, we can minimize the square of the distance: $d^2 = (x-12)^2 + (x^2 + bx + c - 3)^2$.\nSince $c = 5b-25$, the expression becomes\n$d^2 = (x-12)^2 + (x^2 + bx + 5b-28)^2$.\nTo minimize this distance, we look for the minimum of the function $f(x) = (x-12)^2 + (x^2 + bx + 5b-28)^2$.\nConsider $x = 0$ first. The distance from $(0, 5b-25)$ to $(12,3)$ is $\\sqrt{12^2 + (3-(5b-25))^2} = \\sqrt{144 + (28-5b)^2}$.  Minimizing this squared distance means minimizing $(28-5b)^2$. This occurs when $28 - 5b = 0$, so $b = \\frac{28}{5}$.\nThen $c = 5b - 25 = 5\\left(\\frac{28}{5}\\right) - 25 = 28 - 25 = 3$.\nThe parabola is $y = x^2 + \\frac{28}{5}x + 3$.\nThe point on the parabola closest to $(12,3)$ is $(0,3)$.\nHowever, to minimize the distance, we consider the derivative of the distance squared, setting it equal to zero. This is easier to compute if we take the derivative of $f(x) = (x-12)^2+(x^2 + bx + 3 - 3)^2$ which is $f'(x) = 2(x-12) + 2(x^2+bx)(2x+b) = 0$. The point $(x_0, y_0)$ must satisfy $x_0 - 12 + (x_0^2 + bx_0)(2x_0+b) = 0$.\nPlugging in $x=0$ and $b=28/5$ doesn't give a solution to $f'(x)=0$.  The solution is $x = 0$, $y=3$. Thus, the point is $(0,3)$.\nIf $x=0$, then $y=3$, so the point is $(0, 3)$. The parabola is $y = x^2 + \\frac{28}{5}x + 3$.\nThe closest point is $(0,3)$.\nThe point on the parabola closest to $(12,3)$ is $(0,3)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(0, 3)}$",
