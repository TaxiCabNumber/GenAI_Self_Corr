        "inference": "To find the domain of $\\sqrt{3^x - 7^x}$, we need $3^x - 7^x > 0$.\nWe have $3^x - 7^x > 0$.  We can rewrite this as $3^x > 7^x$.\nSince $x < 0$, then $7^x > 1$ and $3^x < 1$.  So $3^x > 7^x$ is equivalent to $7^x < 3^x$, so this does not hold for $x < 0$.\nWe want $3^x > 7^x$. Taking the logarithm base 10 on both sides, we have $x \\ln(3) > x \\ln(7)$, which simplifies to $x(\\ln(3) - \\ln(7)) > 0$.\nSince $\\ln(3) < \\ln(7)$, $\\ln(3) - \\ln(7) < 0$. Thus, $x < 0$ is required for the inequality to hold.\n$$ 3^x > 7^x $$\nDividing by $7^x$ gives\n$$ \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^x > 1 $$\nSince $0 < 3/7 < 1$, the inequality is true when $x < 0$.
