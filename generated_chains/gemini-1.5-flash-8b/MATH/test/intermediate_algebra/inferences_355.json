Each slice has a width of $1$ cm and is cut parallel to one face of the cheese. The individual slices are not necessarily parallel to each other. What is the maximum possible volume in cubic cm of the remaining block of cheese after ten slices have been cut off?",
        "inference": "To maximize the remaining volume, the ten slices should be cut from the faces with the smallest dimensions. The dimensions are 10 cm, 13 cm, and 14 cm. The smallest dimensions are 10 cm and 13 cm.  Each slice has a width of 1 cm, so the maximum number of slices from each 10 cm side is 10 slices. However, we need only ten slices.\n\nThe slices can be cut in a variety of ways, but to maximize the volume, the slices should be taken from the smallest faces. In this case, the two smallest faces have dimensions 10 cm by 13 cm. Cutting 10 slices along the 10 cm dimension, we will remove 10(13)(1) = 130 cm^3. This leaves the original volume of 10*13*14 = 1820 cm^3 and removes 130 cm^3. Thus, the remaining volume is 1820 - 130 = 1690 cm^3.\n\nConsider the volume of the original cheese: $10 \\times 13 \\times 14 = 1820$ cm$^3$.\nWe are removing 10 slices.\nIf we cut 10 slices of width 1 cm parallel to the 10 cm face, the remaining volume is\n$10 \\times 13 \\times 14 - 10 \\times 13 \\times 1 = 1820 - 130 = 1690$ cm$^3$.\n\nIf we cut along the 13 cm face, we would remove 10(10)(1) = 100 cm$^3$ of cheese.  This would leave $10 \\times 13 \\times 14 - 100 = 1820 - 100 = 1720$ cm$^3$\nIf we cut along the 14 cm face, we would remove 10(10)(1) = 100 cm$^3$ of cheese.  This would leave $10 \\times 13 \\times 14 - 100 = 1820 - 100 = 1720$ cm$^3$\n\nIn the best case, the ten slices can be taken from the 10 x 13 face. The volume of 10 slices is 10 x 1 x 13 = 130 cm$^3$.\n\nThus, we take 10 slices from the 10 x 13 cm face.\nThe remaining volume is $10 \\times 13 \\times 14 - 10 \\times 1 \\times 13 = 1820 - 130 = 1690$ cm$^3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1690}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the lengths of the three sides of the rectangular solid after the cutting be $a,b,c$, so that the desired volume is $abc$. Note that each cut reduces one of the dimensions by one, so that after ten cuts, $a+b+c = 10 + 13 + 14 - 10 = 27$.  By the AM-GM inequality, $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 9 \\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\Longrightarrow abc \\le \\boxed{729}$. Equality is achieved when $a=b=c=9$, which is possible if we make one slice perpendicular to the $10$ cm edge, four slices perpendicular to the $13$ cm edge, and five slices perpendicular to the $14$ cm edge."
