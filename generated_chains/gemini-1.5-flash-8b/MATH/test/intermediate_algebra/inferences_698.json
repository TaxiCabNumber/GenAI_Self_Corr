        "ground_truth": "When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same in a rational function, the horizontal asymptote is the coefficient of the highest degree in the numerator divided by the coefficient of the highest degree in the denominator.

Therefore, there is only one horizontal asymptote, and it is at $y=\\boxed{\\frac43}$."
