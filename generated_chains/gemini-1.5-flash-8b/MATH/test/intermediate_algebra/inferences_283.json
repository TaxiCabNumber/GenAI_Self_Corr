        "inference": "The problem states that the parabola $y_1 = x^2$ is tangent to the quartic $y_2 = x^4 + ax^3 + x^2 + bx + 1$ at two points. This means the difference between the two functions must have two identical roots.\n$y_2 - y_1 = x^4 + ax^3 + bx + 1 - x^2 = x^4 + ax^3 - x^2 + bx + 1 = 0$.\nSince the curves are tangent, the difference must have a double root, say $x=r$.  Let the other two roots be $s$ and $t$.\nThe equation can be factored as $(x-r)^2 (x-s)(x-t) = 0$.\nThe given quartic factors into $(x^2-2x+1)(x^2+2x+1) = x^4+2x^2+1$.\nComparing the coefficients, we must have $x^4 + ax^3 - x^2 + bx + 1 = x^4 + 2x^2 + 1$.\nEquating the coefficients of the $x^3$ term gives $a=0$, and the coefficient of $x^2$ term gives $-1=0$.\nComparing the coefficients gives $a=0$ and $b=0$. Then we have $x^4 + 0x^3 + bx + 1 = x^4 - x^2 + bx + 1$, which doesn't give us a double root.\nIf $x=1$, we have $1 + a + 1 + b + 1 = 0$ and $1 + a + 1 + b + 1 - 1 = 0$\n$y_2 - y_1 = (x-1)^2(x-i)(x+i)$.
