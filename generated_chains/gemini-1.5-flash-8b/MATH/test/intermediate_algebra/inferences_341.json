Thus the x-coordinate of B is $x = -a$ and the y-coordinate is $y = -a^2$. Thus the x-coordinate of $B$ is $-a$, and the y-coordinate is $a^2$.  Since $A$ lies on the parabola $y = x^2$, $a^2 = a^2$.  Since $C$ lies on the parabola $y = x^2$, $(-a)^2 = a^2$.\nSince $OABC$ is a rectangle, the coordinates of $B$ are $(x,y)$.\nThe coordinates of $A$ are $(x_A, y_A)$, $C$ are $(x_C, y_C)$, and $B$ are $(x_B, y_B)$.\nThe points $A$ and $C$ lie on the parabola $y=x^2$.\nThus $y_A = x_A^2$ and $y_C = x_C^2$.\nSince $OABC$ is a rectangle, $x_A = -x_C$ and $y_A = y_B$ and $y_C = y_B$.\nThus $x_C = -a$ and $x_A = a$.\nFrom $y_A = x_A^2 = a^2$ and $y_C = x_C^2 = a^2$, we have $y_A = y_C = a^2$.\nThus $B$ has coordinates $(x_B, a^2)$.\nThe slope of $OA$ is $y_A/x_A = a^2/a = a$, and the slope of $OC$ is $y_C/x_C = a^2/(-a) = -a$.\nSince $OC$ is perpendicular to $OA$, $x_B = x_A - x_C = a - (-a) = 2a$.\nThe coordinates of B are $(x_B, y_B)$.
