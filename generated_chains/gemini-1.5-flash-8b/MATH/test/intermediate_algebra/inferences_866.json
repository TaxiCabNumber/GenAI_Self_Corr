        "ground_truth": "By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of the polynomial must be an integer, and divide $12$. Therefore, the integer roots are among the numbers $1,2,3,4,6,12$ and their negatives. We can start by trying $x=1$, which gives\n$$1+2-7-8+12=0.$$Hence, $1$ is a root! By the factor theorem, this means $x-1$ must be a factor of the polynomial. We can divide (using long division or synthetic division) to get $x^4+2x^3-7x^2-8x+12 = (x-1)(x^3+3x^2-4x-12)$. Now the remaining roots of our original polynomial are the roots of $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$, which has the same constant factor so we have the same remaining possibilities for roots. We can keep trying from the remaining 11 possibilities for factors of $12$ to find that $x=2$ gives us\n$$2^3+3\\cdot2^2-4\\cdot2-12 = 8+12-8-12=0.$$Therefore $2$ is a root and again the factor theorem tells us that $x-2$ must be a factor of the polynomial. Dividing $x^3+3x^2-4x-12$ by $x-2$ gives us $x^3+3x^2-4x-12 = (x-2)(x^2+5x+6)$. We can factorise $x^2+5x+6$ as $(x+2)(x+3)$ which gives us our last two roots of $-3$ and $-2$ (both of which divide $12$).\nThus our roots are $\\boxed{1,2,-2,-3}$."
