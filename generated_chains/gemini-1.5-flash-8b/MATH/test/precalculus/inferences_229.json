        "inference": "The amplitude of a cosine function $y = a \\cos bx$ is given by $|a|$.  The maximum value is 3 and the minimum value is -3.  The difference between the maximum and minimum values is $3 - (-3) = 6$.  The amplitude is half of this difference, which is $6/2 = 3$.\nThus, $|a|=3$, which means $a=3$ or $a=-3$.\nSince the graph shows $y = a\\cos(bx)$, and the maximum is 3, the value of $a$ is positive.  Thus, $a = 3$.\n\n$\\boxed{3}$\n",
