        "inference": "The midpoint of the main diagonal is the center of the cube.  Since the main diagonal connects opposite vertices, the center is the average of the coordinates of the vertices.

The midpoint of AC is $\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{3+1}{2},\\frac{0+8}{2}\\right)=(3,2,4)$.  This is incorrect. \nThis is a direct calculation using the formula for the center of a cube given three vertices.  The given calculation for the midpoint of AC is correct and gives the same result.\nThe vertices of a cube have the form (a,b,c)\nThe center of the cube is given by the average of the coordinates of the vertices.\nThe center of the cube is $(\\frac{2+0+4}{3},\\frac{3+5+1}{3},\\frac{0+4+8}{3}) = (2,3,4)$. This is incorrect because you use the average over 3 points and a cube has 8 points.\nThe coordinates of the vertices are given.  Find the midpoint of the main diagonal. We use the midpoints of opposite vertices to find the center. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting A to the opposite vertex must be the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting B to the opposite vertex. So we are given A,B,C. Then the midpoint of AC is (3,2,4). If D = (x,y,z) is the opposite vertex to A, then the midpoint of BD is (3,2,4).\n$\\frac{0+x}{2} = 3 \\Rightarrow x = 6$\n$\\frac{5+y}{2} = 2 \\Rightarrow y = -1$\n$\\frac{4+z}{2} = 4 \\Rightarrow z = 4$\nThus the opposite vertex is (6,-1,4).\n\nThe correct calculation of the center is $(2,3,4)$.
