Thus, $3-ki = 0$, which means $3=ki$.  This implies $k \\ne 0$ and $i = \\frac{3}{k}$.\nThus, $k$ cannot be real.\n\nThe modulus of a complex number $a+bi$ is $|a+bi|=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\n$|3-ki| = \\sqrt{3^2+(-k)^2} = \\sqrt{9+k^2}=0$ which only happens when $9+k^2=0$.\nThe equation $9+k^2=0$ has no real solution for $k$.\n\nIf $|3-ki|=0$, then $3-ki=0$, so $3=ki$, which means $k\\ne 0$ and $i=\\frac{3}{k}$.\n\nThe given equation is $|3-ki| = 0$.  The magnitude of a complex number is zero if and only if the complex number is zero.  Therefore, we must have $3 - ki = 0$. This means $ki = 3$. Since $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, we have $k\\sqrt{-1} = 3$. Thus $k i = 3$.\nBut we need to solve for real $k$.\nThe modulus of a complex number must be nonnegative. The only way the modulus is zero is if the complex number itself is zero.\n$|3-ki| = 0 \\Rightarrow 3-ki = 0$\n$3 = ki \\Rightarrow k=\\frac{3}{i} = -3i$\nThe value of $k$ must be imaginary.\n$|3-ki|=0$ means $3-ki=0$ and $k\\ne 0$.\n\nIf $3-ki=0$, then $3=ki$, so $k=\\frac{3}{i}=-3i$.  $k$ is imaginary.\nThere are no real values of $k$ that satisfy the equation.\n$|3-ki|=0 \\implies 3-ki=0 \\implies ki=3$ and $k \\ne 0$.\nSince $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, $k\\sqrt{-1}=3 \\implies k=-3i$, which is not a real value of $k$.\n\nThus there are no real values of k satisfying $|3-ki|=0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$",
