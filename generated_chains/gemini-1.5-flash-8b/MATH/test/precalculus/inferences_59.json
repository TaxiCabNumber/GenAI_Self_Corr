        "inference": "The possible values of $zw$ are of the form $e^{i2\\pi (k/18 + \\ell/48)} = e^{i2\\pi \\frac{8k+3\\ell}{144}}$. Since the exponent is in the interval $[0, 1]$, we want to count the number of distinct values of $\\frac{8k+3\\ell}{144}$ where $0 \\le k \\le 17$ and $0 \\le \\ell \\le 47$.\n\nWe are looking for the number of distinct fractions $\\frac{8k+3\\ell}{144}$ for $0 \\le k \\le 17$ and $0 \\le \\ell \\le 47$. This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct values of $8k+3\\ell$ for $0 \\le k \\le 17$ and $0 \\le \\ell \\le 47$.\nSince $\\gcd(8, 3) = 1$, for each possible value of $8k + 3\\ell \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 143\\}$, we can find a unique pair $(k, \\ell)$ that satisfies the equation.

This means that for every possible value of $n$, $0 \\le n \\le 143$, there exists a pair $(k,\\ell)$ such that $8k+3\\ell \\equiv n \\pmod{144}$.\n\nThis is a consequence of the fact that $8$ and $3$ are relatively prime.  By the Euclidean Algorithm or observation, there are integers $a$ and $b$ such that $8a+3b = 1$. This means that for any integer $n$, we can find $k$ and $\\ell$.
