        "inference": "The triangle DEF is a right triangle with the right angle at E.  We are given that $\\sin D = 0.7$, which is the ratio of the side opposite angle D to the hypotenuse.  In this case, the side opposite angle D is EF, and the hypotenuse is DF.  We know that $\\sin D = \\frac{EF}{DF}$.  We are given EF = 7.  So we have $0.7 = \\frac{7}{DF}$.  Solving for DF, we get $DF = \\frac{7}{0.7} = 10$.\n\nNow we use the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle DEF.  We have $DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2$.  We know EF = 7 and DF = 10.  Substituting these values, we get $DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2$. This simplifies to $DE^2 + 49 = 100$.  Subtracting 49 from both sides gives $DE^2 = 51$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $DE = \\sqrt{51}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{51}}$\n",
