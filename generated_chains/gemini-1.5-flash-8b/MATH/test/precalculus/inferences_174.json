        "inference": "The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\cos 2t$.\nWe have $\\cos 2t = 2\\cos^2 t - 1 = 2x^2 - 1$.\nSo the equation is $y = 2x^2 - 1$.\nSince $\\cos t$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$, $x$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$.\nThe parabola $y = 2x^2 - 1$ opens upwards.\nThe part of the parabola where $x = \\pm 1$ corresponds to $\\cos t = \\pm 1$, i.e., $t = 0, \\pi$.\nThe part of the parabola where $y = -1$ corresponds to $\\cos 2t = -1$, i.e., $2t = \\pi + 2n\\pi \\Rightarrow t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$, where $n$ is an integer.\nThe $x$-values for these points are $x = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = 0$.\nSince $x = \\cos t$, $x^2 = \\cos^2 t$.\nThe values of $x^2$ range from 0 to 1. Thus, $-1 \\le x \\le 1$.\nThe equation is $y = 2x^2 - 1$.\n$x^2 = \\cos^2 t$, $y = \\cos 2t$.\nIf $x^2 = 1$, then $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.\n$y = 2(1)^2 - 1 = 1$\n$y = 2(-1)^2 - 1 = 1$\nThus the parabola is $y = 2x^2 - 1$, with $-1 \\le x \\le 1$.\nThe portion of the parabola in the interval $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ is from the point $(-1, 1)$ to $(1, 1)$.\nThe vertex of the parabola is $(0, -1)$.\nThe range of $y$ is $-1 \\le y \\le 1$.\nThe correct part of the parabola is the portion where $-1 \\le x \\le 1$.\nThe values of $x$ are from $-1$ to $1$. Thus, $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ which is the segment of the parabola.\n\nThe graph is a portion of the parabola $y = 2x^2 - 1$.\nThe given parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\cos 2t$.\nThe equation is $y = 2x^2 - 1$, $-1 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\n$\\boxed{(C)}$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(C)}$",
        "ground_truth": "Note that\n\\[y = \\cos 2t = 2 \\cos^2 t - 1 = 2x^2 - 1,\\]so all the plotted points lie on a parabola.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}}.$"
