At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe least common multiple of two integers is 240, and the greatest common divisor is 24. Given that one of the integers is 48, what is the other integer?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be a and b.\nWe are given that LCM(a, b) = 240 and GCD(a, b) = 24, and a = 48.\nWe know that for any two integers a and b,\nLCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b) = a * b.\nSubstituting the given values, we have\n240 * 24 = 48 * b\n5760 = 48 * b\nb = 5760 / 48\nb = 120\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4\\cdot3$. Since the greatest common factor is 24, that means the other number also has the factors $2^3$ and 3 but not a fourth 2. When we divide 240 by 48, we get 5. The factors $2^3$ and 3 of the other number are covered by the factors of 48, but the factor 5 must come from the other number. So, the other number is $2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{120}$."
