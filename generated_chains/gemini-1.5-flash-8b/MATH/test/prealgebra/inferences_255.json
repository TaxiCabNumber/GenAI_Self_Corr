At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach interior angle of a polygon measures 170 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",

Therefore, $n$ interior angles add up to $n \\times 170^\\circ$.  Thus we have\n$(n-2) \\times 180 = n \\times 170$.
