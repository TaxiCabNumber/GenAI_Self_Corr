At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many feet long is the shadow of a 15-foot flagpole if a 5-foot woman standing at the base of the flagpole has a shadow that is six feet long?",
        "inference": "Similar triangles are formed by the flagpole, its shadow, the woman, and her shadow.  The ratio of the height of the flagpole to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the woman to the length of her shadow.\n\nLet $h_f$ be the height of the flagpole, $s_f$ be the length of the flagpole's shadow, $h_w$ be the height of the woman, and $s_w$ be the length of the woman's shadow. We have\n$h_f = 15$ feet\n$h_w = 5$ feet\n$s_w = 6$ feet\n\nWe have the proportion:\n$\\frac{h_f}{s_f} = \\frac{h_w}{s_w}$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$\\frac{15}{s_f} = \\frac{5}{6}$\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n$15 \\times 6 = 5 \\times s_f$\n$90 = 5s_f$\n$s_f = \\frac{90}{5} = 18$ feet\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have $5 \\text{ foot object} : 6 \\text{ foot shadow}$. We want to find the length of the shadow of a 15-foot object. Multiplying both parts of the ratio by $\\frac{15}{5}=3$, we have $3 \\cdot 5 \\text{ foot object} : 3 \\cdot 6 \\text{ foot shadow} \\Rightarrow 15 \\text{ foot object} : 18 \\text{ foot shadow}$. Thus, the shadow is $\\boxed{18}$ feet long."
