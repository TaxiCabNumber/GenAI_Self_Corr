        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlison wants to approximate the cost of her basket of groceries. She bought a cake for $17.86$ dollars, a bag of apples for $7.46$ dollars, and a bag of celery for $8.66$ dollars. Which of the following is the closest to the actual cost of the groceries?\n\n$\\bullet$ A. $50$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ B. $38$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ C. $34$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ D. $26$ dollars\n\n$\\bullet$ E. $20$ dollars\n\nExpress your answer as A, B, C, D, or E.",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the groceries: $17.86 + 7.46 + 8.66 = 34.00$\n\n2. Compare the calculated total cost to the given options.  $34$ is closest to the calculated total cost.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{C}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We can round $17.86$ dollars to $18$ dollars, $7.46$ dollars to $7$ dollars, and $8.66$ dollars to $9$ dollars. The approximate cost of the groceries is $18+7+9=34$ dollars, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{C}}.$\n\nNote that a calculator gives the answer $33.98$ for the actual cost, which confirms that answer choice C is the closest to the actual cost."
