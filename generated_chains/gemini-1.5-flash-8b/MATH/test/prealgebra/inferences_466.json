At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 3-letter \"words\" can be formed from the standard 26-letter alphabet, if the first letter must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U)? (We aren't necessarily talking about English words; something like EQX is perfectly valid here.)",
        "inference": "There are 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U).\nThere are 26 letters in the alphabet.\nThe first letter must be a vowel.  So there are 5 choices for the first letter.\nThe second letter can be any of the 26 letters. So there are 26 choices.\nThe third letter can be any of the 26 letters. So there are 26 choices.\nThe total number of 3-letter words is $5 \\times 26 \\times 26 = 5 \\times 676 = 3380$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3380}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
