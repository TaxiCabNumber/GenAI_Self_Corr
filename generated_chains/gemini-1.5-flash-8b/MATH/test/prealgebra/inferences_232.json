        "ground_truth": "Based on the histogram, we can make an educated guess that the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast will be around $2$ or $3$ (simply because there are a large number of years for which no hurricanes or only one hurricane reached the east coast).

There are $5 + 14 = 19$ years in which zero or one hurricanes reached the east coast. Thus, the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast is $\\boxed{2}$."
