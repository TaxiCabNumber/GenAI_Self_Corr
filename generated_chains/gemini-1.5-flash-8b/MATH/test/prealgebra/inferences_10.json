        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJavier is biking at 15 miles per hour. There are 5280 feet in a mile. How many feet does he travel in one minute?",
        "inference": "1. Convert miles per hour to miles per minute:\n   15 miles/hour * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 15/60 miles/minute = 0.25 miles/minute\n\n2. Convert miles per minute to feet per minute:\n   0.25 miles/minute * 5280 feet/mile = 1320 feet/minute\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1320}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 15 miles per hour is 1/4 mile per minute, Javier travels $(5280)(1/4) = \\boxed{1320}$ feet in one minute."
