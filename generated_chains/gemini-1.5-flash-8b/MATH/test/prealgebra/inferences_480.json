At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA card is drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that it is an odd number (3,5,7,9) or a $\\spadesuit$ (or both)?",
        "inference": "There are 52 cards in a standard deck.\nOdd numbers (3, 5, 7, 9) are represented by 4 cards in each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).\nThus, there are 4 * 4 = 16 odd-numbered cards.\nSpades cards are 13.\nThere are 4 cards that are both odd and spades.  These are 3, 5, 7, 9 of spades.\nThe number of cards that are odd or spades is\n$16 + 13 - 4 = 25$\nThe probability is $\\frac{25}{52}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{52}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 16 odd-numbered cards, namely 4 suits for each of the 4 odd digits. There are 13 $\\spadesuit$s, but 4 of these we already counted among the odd-numbered cards.  So the total number of cards that are odd or a $\\spadesuit$ is $16+(13-4)=25$, and the probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{52}}$."
