At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe owners of a house that is assessed at $\\$120,\\!000$ pay $\\$3,\\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\\$160,\\!000$?",

Calculate the tax for the house assessed at $160,000:\n   Tax = (Tax rate) * (Assessed value) = 0.025 * $160,000 = $4,000\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$4,000}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The value of the $\\$160,\\!000$ house is $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the value of the $\\$120,\\!000$ house, so the tax is $\\frac{4}{3}$ as great as well: $\\$3,\\!000\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{\\$4,\\!000}$."
