At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThink of a number. Double the number. Add 200. Divide the answer by 4. Subtract one-half the original number. What is the value of the result?",
        "inference": "Let the number be $x$.\n1. Double the number: $2x$\n2. Add 200: $2x + 200$\n3. Divide by 4: $\\frac{2x + 200}{4}$\n4.
