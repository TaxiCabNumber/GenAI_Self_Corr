At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNewton High School is selling bag lunches for a field trip.  The price of $3$ lunches is given to be $\\$4.50$. Tyler wants to know if he can afford to buy himself and $4$ of his friends lunch.  If the price of each lunch is fixed, how much money does Tyler need?",
        "inference": "1. Find the price of one lunch:  $4.50 / 3 lunches = $1.50/lunch\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for Tyler and his friends: $1.50/lunch * 5 lunches = $7.50\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$7.50}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $3$ lunches sell for $\\$4.50$, each lunch sells for $\\frac{\\$4.50}{3}=\\$1.50$.  Thus the total cost of $5$ lunches is $5 \\times \\$1.50=\\boxed{\\$7.50}$."
