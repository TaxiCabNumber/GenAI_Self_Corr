        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a girl 5 feet tall could walk around the equator, how many feet further would the top of her head travel than her feet? Assume that the earth is a sphere. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The circumference of the Earth is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the Earth.  The top of the girl's head travels a path whose radius is $r + 5$, and the circumference is $2\\pi (r + 5)$.  The girl's feet travel a path whose radius is $r$, and the circumference is $2\\pi r$. The difference between the distance traveled by the top of the girl's head and the distance traveled by her feet is $2\\pi (r + 5) - 2\\pi r = 2\\pi r + 10\\pi - 2\\pi r = 10\\pi$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10\\pi}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius of the earth in feet. The girl's feet travel along a circle of radius $r$, while the girl's head travels along a circle of radius $r+5$. The circumference of the first circle is $2\\pi r$, while the circumference of the second circle is $2\\pi(r+5) = 2\\pi r + 10\\pi$. So her head travels $(2\\pi r + 10\\pi) - 2\\pi r = \\boxed{10\\pi}$ feet more than her feet."
