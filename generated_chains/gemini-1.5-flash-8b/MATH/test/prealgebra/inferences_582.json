        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a spaceship full of scientists landed on Planet Q, they found that $\\frac{3}{8}$ of the $160$ aliens had $3$ eyes.  The rest of the aliens had 5 eyes. How many eyes total do the 160 aliens have?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of aliens with 3 eyes: $\\frac{3}{8} \\times 160 = 60$ aliens.\n2. Find the number of aliens with 5 eyes: $160 - 60 = 100$ aliens.\n3. Calculate the total eyes from aliens with 3 eyes: $60 \\text{ aliens} \\times 3 \\text{ eyes/alien} = 180$ eyes.\n4. Calculate the total eyes from aliens with 5 eyes: $100 \\text{ aliens} \\times 5 \\text{ eyes/alien} = 500$ eyes.\n5. Calculate the total eyes: $180 + 500 = 680$ eyes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{680}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we count how many aliens have 3 eyes.  Since $\\frac38$ of the 160 aliens have 3 eyes, there are \\[\\frac38\\cdot 160 = \\frac{3\\cdot 160}{8} = 3\\cdot \\frac{160}{8} = 3\\cdot 20 = 60\\]aliens with 3 eyes.  That leaves $160-60=100$ aliens with 5 eyes.  Therefore, the total number of eyes is $60\\cdot 3 + 100\\cdot 5 = 180 + 500 = \\boxed{680}$."
