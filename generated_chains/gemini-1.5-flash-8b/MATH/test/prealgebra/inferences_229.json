        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn 8.5-by-11-inch piece of paper is folded in half repeatedly (never being unfolded), each time shortening what was then the longer side. What is the length of the longest side, in inches, immediately after the second fold? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "1. Initial dimensions: 8.5 inches by 11 inches.\n2. First fold: The longer side (11 inches) is folded in half. The new dimensions are 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches.\n3. Second fold: The longer side (8.5 inches) is folded in half. The new dimensions are 8.5/2 = 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches.\n4. The longest side immediately after the second fold is 5.5 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5.5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For the first fold, we halve the $11$ inch side, forming an $8.5$ by $5.5$ piece.  Now we halve the $8.5$ inch side, forming a $4.25$ by $5.5$ piece after the second fold.  The longer side is $\\boxed{5.5}$ inches."
