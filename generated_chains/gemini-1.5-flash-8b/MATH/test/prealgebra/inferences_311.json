At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diameter of a circle is 16. By what number must the radius be decreased in order to decrease the area of the circle by $48\\pi$?",
        "inference": "1. The original radius is half the diameter, so the original radius is 16/2 = 8.\n\n2. The original area is \u03c0 * (8)^2 = 64\u03c0.\n\n3. The desired decrease in area is 48\u03c0, so the new area is 64\u03c0 - 48\u03c0 = 16\u03c0.\n\n4. The new area is \u03c0 * r^2, where r is the new radius.  Thus, 16\u03c0 = \u03c0 * r^2.\n\n5. Divide both sides by \u03c0 to get 16 = r^2.\n\n6. Take the square root of both sides to get r = 4.\n\n7. The radius must be decreased by 8 - 4 = 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the diameter of the circle is $16$, then its radius is $8$. The area of this circle is then $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (8^2) = 64 \\pi$.

Now that we know the area of this circle, we can find its radius $R$ by setting $\\pi R^2$ equal to $16 \\pi$, so we have that $\\pi R^2 = 16 \\pi$ and $R = 4$.\n\nThe radius of the first circle was $8$ and the new radius is $4$, so the radius was decreased by $8-4=\\boxed{4}$."
