At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a 12-hour analog clock reads 8:00, what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands?",
        "inference": "The minute hand is at the 12, which is 0 degrees.\nThe hour hand is at the 8, which is (8/12) * 360 = 240 degrees.\nThe difference in degrees is 240 - 0 = 240 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{240}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
