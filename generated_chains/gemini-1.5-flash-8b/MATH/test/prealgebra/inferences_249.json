At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLucia flips a coin three times. What is the probability that she gets Head-Tail-Head, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of getting a head on a coin flip is 1/2, and the probability of getting a tail is 1/2.  Since the coin flips are independent events, the probability of getting Head-Tail-Head in that order is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "To count the total number of outcomes, we consider that there are three flips, and each one has two results, giving us $2^3 = 8$ possibilities. Head-Tail-Head is only one of these outcomes.  So, the probability of success is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
