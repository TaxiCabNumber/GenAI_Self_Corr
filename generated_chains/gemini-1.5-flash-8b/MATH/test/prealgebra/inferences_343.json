        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circle is inscribed in a square with perimeter of 32 inches. What is the circumference of the circle, in inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The perimeter of a square is given by $P = 4s$, where $s$ is the side length.  We are given $P = 32$ inches, so $4s = 32$, which means $s = 8$ inches.\n\nThe diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square.  So the diameter is $8$ inches.\n\nThe radius of the circle is half the diameter, which is $r = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$ inches.\n\nThe circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$.  Substituting $r = 4$, we get $C = 2\\pi(4) = 8\\pi$ inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8\\pi}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the square's side length.  The side length of the square is $(32\\text{ in.})/4=8$ inches. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\cdot(8\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{8\\pi}$ inches."
