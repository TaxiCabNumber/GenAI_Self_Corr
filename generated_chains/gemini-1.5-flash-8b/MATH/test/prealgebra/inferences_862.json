At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has two sides of length $6$ units each.  What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
        "inference": "The triangle is a right triangle with two sides of length 6 units each.  If the two sides are legs, then the area is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18 square units.\nIf one of the sides is the hypotenuse, then by the Pythagorean theorem, the other two sides satisfy $6^2 + 6^2 = c^2$, so $36 + 36 = c^2$, which means $72 = c^2$.  Thus, $c = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.  In this case, the area is still (1/2) * 6 * 6 = 18 square units.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The two lengths of 6 units must be the two bases of the right triangle, because the hypotenuse in a right triangle must be longer than each base. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6\\cdot6}{2}=\\boxed{18}$ square units."
