At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can a 2-person committee be chosen from a group of 5 people (where the order in which we choose the 2 people doesn't matter)?",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose 2 people from a group of 5 people without regard to order is given by the combination formula:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\nIn this case, $n=5$ and $k=2$.\n$$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter.  So again, there are 5 ways to choose the first person, then 4 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $5 \\times 4$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $(5 \\times 4)/2 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to choose a 2-person committee from 5 people."
