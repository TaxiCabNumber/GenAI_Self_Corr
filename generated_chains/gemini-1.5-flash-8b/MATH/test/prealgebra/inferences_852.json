At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 5-inch by 7-inch picture is placed on a rectangular piece of red paper such that a 0.5-inch wide red border is seen along each side of the picture. What is the area of the visible red border, in square inches?",
        "inference": "The picture is 5 inches by 7 inches.\nThe red border is 0.5 inches wide on each side.\nThe dimensions of the paper including the border are:\nLength = 7 inches + 2 * 0.5 inches = 7 inches + 1 inch = 8 inches\nWidth = 5 inches + 2 * 0.5 inches = 5 inches + 1 inch = 6 inches\nThe area of the paper including the border is 8 inches * 6 inches = 48 square inches.\nThe area of the picture is 5 inches * 7 inches = 35 square inches.\nThe area of the visible red border is the area of the paper minus the area of the picture.\nArea of the visible red border = 48 square inches - 35 square inches = 13 square inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The piece of red paper must have dimensions of 6 inches by 8 inches in order to have a 0.5 inch border on each side. The area of the paper is 48 square inches, of which $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ square inches are obscured by the picture.
