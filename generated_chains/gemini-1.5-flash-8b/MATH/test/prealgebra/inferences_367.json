At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo right triangles have equal areas. The first triangle has a height of 5 cm and a corresponding base of 8 cm. The second triangle has a leg of length 20 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the second triangle, in cm?",
        "inference": "Area of first triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 8 * 5 = 20 sq cm.\nArea of second triangle = 20 sq cm.\nLet the second triangle have legs of length a and b, where a = 20.\nArea of second triangle = (1/2) * a * b = (1/2) * 20 * b = 10b.\n10b = 20.\nb = 2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since in a triangle $A = \\frac{1}{2} bh$, we see that the product of the base and height must be the same in both triangles.  So $5\\cdot 8 = \\text{(second triangle's base)}\\cdot20$, meaning that the second triangle's base is $\\boxed{2}$ centimeters."
