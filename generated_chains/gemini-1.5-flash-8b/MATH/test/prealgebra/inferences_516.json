        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a spaceship full of scientists landed on Planet Q, they found that $\\frac{17}{40}$ of the $160$ aliens had $3$ eyes.  How many aliens had $3$ eyes?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of aliens with 3 eyes:\n$\\frac{17}{40} \\times 160 = \\frac{17}{1} \\times 4 = 68$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{68}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Remembering that \"of\" means \"times,\" the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\\frac{17}{40} \\cdot 160$.  This equals $\\frac{17 \\cdot 160}{40}$, which can be rewritten as $17 \\cdot \\frac{160}{40}$.  Because $160$ divided by $40$ equals $4$, the expression above is the same as $17 \\cdot 4$, which equals $\\boxed{68}$."
