At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 3:20, what is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand on a 12-hour analog clock?",
        "inference": "1. The minute hand is at the 4, which is 4 * 30 = 120 degrees from 12.\n2. The hour hand is at 3:20, which is $\\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from the 3 to the 4.\n3. The position of the hour hand is $3 \\times 30 + \\frac{1}{3}(30) = 90 + 10 = 100$ degrees from 12.\n4. The difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands is $|120 - 100| = 20$ degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is $\\frac{20}{60}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from the 3 o'clock to the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=10$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The minute hand is in the 4 o'clock position, so it has moved $\\frac{1}{12}\\cdot 360^\\circ=30$ degrees past the 3 o'clock position.  The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is $30-10=\\boxed{20}$ degrees."
