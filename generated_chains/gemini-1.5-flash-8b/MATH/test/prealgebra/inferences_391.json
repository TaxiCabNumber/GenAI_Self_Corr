At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can I put down two indistinguishable pieces on an ordinary $8\\times 8$ chessboard, if the pieces must either be in the same row or be in the same column?",

Number of ways to place two pieces in the same row: There are 8 rows. For each row, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$ ways to place two pieces in that row. So, there are $8 \\times 28 = 224$ ways to place the two pieces in the same row.\n\n3. Number of ways to place two pieces in the same column: There are 8 columns. For each column, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28$ ways to place two pieces in that column. So, there are $8 \\times 28 = 224$ ways to place the two pieces in the same column.\n\n4. We counted the cases where both pieces are in the same row and in the same column twice. The number of ways to put two pieces in the same row and column is $8$ (since there are 8 rows and 8 columns, the same diagonal combinations will be counted twice).\n\n5. Number of ways to place the two pieces in the same row or same column is $224 + 224 - 8 = 440$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{440}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$."
