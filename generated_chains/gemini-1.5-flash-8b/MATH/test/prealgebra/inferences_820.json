        "inference": "The stairway has 3 risers, each 8 inches high.  The total height of the stairway is 3 * 8 = 24 inches.  The stairway has 3 treads, each 10 inches deep.  The total horizontal length is 3 * 10 = 30 inches.  The area of the side panel is a trapezoid on the bottom and a rectangle on top. The area of the trapezoid (the stairs) is (1/2)(b1 + b2)(h), where b1 and b2 are the parallel sides and h is the height.\nThe trapezoid has b1 = 30, b2 = 0, and h = 24.  So, (1/2)(30+0)(24) = (1/2)(30)(24) = 15(24) = 360.\nThe total area of the side panel is 360 square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360}$\n",
