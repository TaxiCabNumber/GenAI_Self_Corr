I hope it is correct.'\nBetty has between $40$ and $50$ pennies that she wants to arrange in a rectangular array. She notices she can arrange the pennies in three different ways without any gaps or spaces. However, if Betty adds two more pennies to her collection, she can only arrange the pennies in one way without any gaps or spaces: a straight line. How many pennies did Betty originally have?\n\nNote: An $a \\times b$ rectangle is considered the same as a $b \\times a$ rectangle.",
