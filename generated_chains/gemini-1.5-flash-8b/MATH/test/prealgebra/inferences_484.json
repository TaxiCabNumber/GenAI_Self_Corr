At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain amount of time, a plane traveling at a constant $250$ miles per hour traveled $20,\\!000$ feet.  In this same amount of time, how many feet would a plane traveling at a constant $400$ miles per hour travel?",
        "inference": "1. Convert miles per hour to feet per hour.  $250$ miles per hour is equal to $250 \\times 5280 = 1,320,000$ feet per hour.  $400$ miles per hour is equal to $400 \\times 5280 = 2,112,000$ feet per hour.\n\n2. Let $t$ be the time in hours.  The distance traveled by the first plane is $1,320,000t = 20,000$ feet. Solving for $t$, we get $t = \\frac{20,000}{1,320,000} = \\frac{1}{66}$ hours.\n\n3. To find the distance traveled by the second plane in the same amount of time, multiply the speed of the second plane by the time $t$. The distance traveled by the second plane is $2,112,000 \\times \\frac{1}{66} = 32,000$ feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32000}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the ratio of the speeds of the planes will be equal to the ratio of the distances that each travels.  Since the ratio of the speed of the faster plane to that of the slower one is $\\frac{400}{250}$, the distance that the faster plane travels is $20,\\!000 \\times \\frac{400}{250}=\\boxed{32,\\!000}$ feet.\n\nAnother way to do this problem is to use the formula Distance = Rate $\\times$ Time. We would use this formula to find, using the information of the first plane, the exact amount of time it took to travel $20,\\!000$ feet. Then using this new information we would again apply the formula, this time for the second plane, to find the answer.  This approach, however, is more complicated and requires conversion between units (feet to miles and vice versa)."

        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear.  We need to know what distance the planes are trying to cover.  Assuming they are both trying to cover the same distance, the solution doesn't make sense because it finds the time to cover a distance of 20,000 feet for the first plane, and then uses that time for the second plane, but those times are not consistent with the rest of the problem.\n\nTo correct the error, we assume that the planes are traveling for the same amount of time $t$.  Plane 1 travels at 250 mph, and Plane 2 travels at 400 mph. We need to know the *distance* traveled by each plane to determine the final answer.\n\nLet's assume the planes travel for 1 hour.\n\nPlane 1: 250 miles/hour * 1 hour = 250 miles.\n250 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 1,320,000 feet.\n\nPlane 2: 400 miles/hour * 1 hour = 400 miles.\n400 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 2,112,000 feet.\n\nIf the planes travel for the same amount of time, we can set up a proportion:\n250 miles / 400 miles = distance 1 / distance 2\n\nDistance 1/distance 2 = 5/8. If the distance covered by Plane 1 is 20,000 feet, then Distance 2 = 20,000 * 8 / 5 = 32,000 feet\n\nHowever, if we are given that the first plane travels 20000 feet, we are looking for the distance traveled by the second plane in the same time.\nIf Plane 1 travels 20000 feet, then we can use the ratio of their speeds to find the distance the second plane will travel:\n\n(Speed of Plane 2) / (Speed of Plane 1) = (Distance of Plane 2) / (Distance of Plane 1)\n\n(400 mph) / (250 mph) = (Distance of Plane 2) / (20000 ft)\n\nDistance of Plane 2 = (400/250) * 20000 = (8/5) * 20000 = 32000 feet.\n\n$\\boxed{32000}$\n",
