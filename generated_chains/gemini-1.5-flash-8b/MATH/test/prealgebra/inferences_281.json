At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDeanna has $44$ pieces of candy. What is the largest number of kids whom she can give an equal number of candies such that every kid gets at least $3$ pieces?",
        "inference": "1. We need to find the factors of 44 that are greater than or equal to 3.\n2. The factors of 44 are 1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44.\n3. The factors greater than or equal to 3 are 4, 11, 22, 44.\n4. The largest factor of 44 that is greater than or equal to 3 is 44.\n5. If each kid gets 44 candies, then only 1 kid can receive them.\n6. If each kid gets 22 candies, then 2 kids can receive them.\n7. If each kid gets 11 candies, then 4 kids can receive them.\n8. If each kid gets 4 candies, then 11 kids can receive them.\n9. The largest number of kids is 11.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For $n$ kids to each get at least $3$ pieces of candy, there must be at least $3n$ pieces of candy, so we must have $3n\\le 44$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $3$, we have $n\\le 14\\frac23$. Since the number of kids must be an integer, the largest possible number of kids is $\\boxed{14}$."

The factors greater than or equal to 3 are 4, 11, 22, 44.\n4. The question asks for the largest number of kids that can receive candies.  We are given the total number of candies, which is 44.  Each factor represents the number of candies each kid receives.  The corresponding number of kids is found by dividing the total candies by the number of candies per kid.\n\n4 candies per kid: 44 candies / 4 candies/kid = 11 kids\n11 candies per kid: 44 candies / 11 candies/kid = 4 kids\n22 candies per kid: 44 candies / 22 candies/kid = 2 kids\n44 candies per kid: 44 candies / 44 candies/kid = 1 kid\n\n5.
