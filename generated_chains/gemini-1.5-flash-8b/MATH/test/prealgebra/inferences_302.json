At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a class of $30$ students, exactly $7$ have been to Mexico and exactly $11$ have been to England. Of these $30$ students, $4$ have been to both Mexico and England. How many students in this class have not been to Mexico or England?",
        "inference": "Let M be the set of students who have been to Mexico, and E be the set of students who have been to England.\nWe are given that $|M| = 7$, $|E| = 11$, and $|M \\cap E| = 4$.\nWe want to find the number of students who have not been to Mexico or England.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of students who have been to Mexico or England is given by:\n$|M \\cup E| = |M| + |E| - |M \\cap E| = 7 + 11 - 4 = 14$.\nThe number of students who have not been to Mexico or England is the total number of students minus the number of students who have been to Mexico or England:\n$30 - |M \\cup E| = 30 - 14 = 16$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Of the $7$ students that have been to Mexico, $4$ have also been to England. Therefore, $7-4=3$ students have been to Mexico and not England.\n\nOf the $11$ students that have been to England, $4$ have also been to Mexico. Therefore, $11-4=7$ students have been to England and not Mexico.\n\nTherefore, $3$ students have been to Mexico only, $7$ students have been to England only, and $4$ students have been to both. In the class of $30$ students, this leaves $30-3-7-4=\\boxed{16}$ students who have not been to Mexico or England."
