I hope it is correct.'\nEvery student in the senior class is taking history or science. There are $200$ seniors in the class. If there are $126$ seniors taking history and $129$ seniors taking science, how many students are taking both history and science?",
        "inference": "Let H be the set of students taking history, and S be the set of students taking science.\nWe are given that $|H| = 126$, $|S| = 129$, and the total number of students is $|H \\cup S| = 200$.\nWe want to find the number of students taking both history and science, which is $|H \\cap S|$.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have\n$|H \\cup S| = |H| + |S| - |H \\cap S|$.\nSubstituting the given values, we get\n$200 = 126 + 129 - |H \\cap S|$.\n$200 = 255 - |H \\cap S|$.\n$|H \\cap S| = 255 - 200$.\n$|H \\cap S| = 55$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{55}$\n",

Solving for $x,$ we get there are $\\boxed{55}$ seniors taking both history and science.\n\nWe can also solve this problem with the Venn Diagram below.
