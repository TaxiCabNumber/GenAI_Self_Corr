At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKathy needs money for her trip to Europe. If she has 300 US dollars in the bank but wants to withdraw half of it in British pounds and half of it in euros, how many more euros than pounds will she have?
