At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?",
        "inference": "1. Let 'x' be the total number of pins John originally had.\n2. Since the piles had an equal number of pins, each pile had x/2 pins.\n3. John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.  This is (1/2) * (1/3) * (x/2) = x/12 pins.\n4. The number of pins in the pile after giving some away = x/2 - x/12 = 5x/12 pins.\n5. Since both piles had the same amount, the other pile also had 5x/12 pins.\n6. The total number of pins left with John = 2 * (5x/12) = 10x/12 = 5x/6.\n7. We know John had 66 pins left, so 5x/6 = 66.\n8. Solving for x:  x = (66 * 6) / 5 = 396 / 5 = 79.2.\n9. Since the number of pins must be a whole number, there must be an error in the problem statement. This calculation would require fractional pins, which is not possible.\n\nLet's assume John gave away one-half of one-third of the *entire* collection.\n\n1. John gave his brother (1/2)*(1/3)*x = x/6 pins.\n2. Pins remaining = x - x/6 = 5x/6\n3. 5x/6 = 66\n4. x = (66*6)/5 = 79.2\n\nHowever, the number of pins must be a whole number. Let's review the problem and assume that each pile originally had an equal number of pins, and each pile initially had x/2 pins, and John gave away (1/2)*(1/3)*(x/2) = x/12 pins.\n\n1. Pins remaining in each pile = x/2 - x/12 = 5x/12\n2. Total pins remaining = 2*(5x/12) = 10x/12 = 5x/6\n3. 5x/6 = 66\n4. x = (66*6)/5 = 79.2\n\nTherefore, the problem's wording is flawed. Let's assume the problem meant that John gave away one-half of one-third of *each* pile.\n1. John gave away (1/2)*(1/3)*(x/2) = x/12 from each pile.\n2. Number remaining in each pile = x/2 - x/12 = 5x/12\n3. Total remaining = (5x/12) + (5x/12) = 10x/12 = 5x/6 = 66\n4. x = (66*6)/5 = 79.2\n\nIf the wording was that each pile originally contained x/2 and he gave (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6 of *each pile*, the answer would be incorrect because the answer is not an integer.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{79.2}$  I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Initially, John has $2a$ pins, where $a$ is the number of pins in each pile. He gives away $\\frac{a}{6}$ pins, so $2a-\\frac{a}{6} = \\frac{11a}{6} = 66$ is the number of pins he has left. We get $a=36$, so he originally had $2a = \\boxed{72}$ pins."

        "inference": "The problem is flawed because the answer, 79.2, is not a whole number, which is required for the number of pins.  The wording needs clarification.  Assuming the problem meant John gave away 1/2 of 1/3 of *each pile*, the calculation leads to a non-integer.  Without further clarification or a change in the wording, the most likely solution is based on the stated problem.\n\n$\\boxed{79.2}$\n",
