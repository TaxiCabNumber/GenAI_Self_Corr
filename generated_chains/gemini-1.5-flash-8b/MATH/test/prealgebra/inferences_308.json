At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct diagonals of a convex pentagon can be drawn?",
        "inference": "A pentagon has 5 vertices.  A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 5 is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\nThese 10 choices include the 5 sides of the pentagon.\nThe number of diagonals is the total number of ways to choose 2 vertices minus the number of sides.\n$10 - 5 = 5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{10}{2} =\\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon."
