        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMario is constructing a square dart board. It will consist of a smaller square centered in a larger square. The smaller square measures $4$ inches on each side. The ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the entire dart board is $\\frac 49$. How long is the side of the larger square?",
        "inference": "1. The area of the smaller square is $4^2 = 16$ square inches.\n\n2. Let $x$ be the side length of the larger square. The area of the larger square is $x^2$.\n\n3. The ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the entire dart board is $\\frac{16}{x^2}$.\n\n4. We are given that this ratio is $\\frac{4}{9}$, so we have the equation $\\frac{16}{x^2} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\n5. Cross-multiplying gives $4x^2 = 144$.\n\n6. Dividing both sides by 4 gives $x^2 = 36$.\n\n7. Taking the square root of both sides gives $x = 6$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The smaller square has area $4^2 = 16$. Suppose the side of the larger square is $s$; then, its area is $s^2$. It follows that $\\frac{16}{s^2} = \\frac 49$, so cross-multiplying $s^2 = 36$. As $s > 0$, then $s = \\boxed{6}$."
