At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach good worker can paint my new house alone in 12 hours.  Each bad worker can paint my house alone in 36 hours.  I need my house painted in 3 hours.  If I can only find 3 good workers, how many bad workers must I also find in order to have my house painted on time?",

Combined rate needed: 1 house / 3 hours = 1/3 houses/hour\n4. Rate of 3 good workers: 3 * (1/12) = 1/4 houses/hour\n5. Rate needed from bad workers: (1/3) - (1/4) = 1/12 houses/hour\n6. Number of bad workers needed: (1/12) / (1/36) = 3\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ . I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.  Since the bad workers together need to paint $1/4$ of the house, and  each bad worker can paint $1/12$ of the house in three hours, I need $(1/4)/(1/12) = \\boxed{3}$ bad workers."

The combined rate of 'x' good workers and 'y' bad workers is (x/12 + y/36) houses/hour.\n5. We need (x/12 + y/36) = 1/3\n6.  If x = 3 good workers, then (3/12) + (y/36) = 1/3.  Simplifying (1/4) + (y/36) = 1/3\n7.  (y/36) = 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12\n8.  y = (1/12) * 36 = 3 bad workers\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
