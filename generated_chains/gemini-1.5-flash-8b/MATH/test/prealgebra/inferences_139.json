What is the arithmetic mean of the median and the mode of the given data?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c ccc c c c}\n4&1&&&&&&&&\\\\\n5&2&&&&&&&&\\\\\n6&7&8&8&&&&&&\\\\\n7&1&1&2&3&3&3&5&6&8\\\\\n8&0&4&4&6&6&6&6&8&\\\\\n9&1&3&5&5&7&&&&\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",

The value 86 appears 4 times, more than any other value. So the mode is 86.\nThe arithmetic mean of the median and the mode is (76 + 86)/2 = 162/2 = 81.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each digit to the right of the vertical bar represents (the units digit of) one exam grade. Counting the digits, we see that there are $27$ exam grades in all. Thus, the $14^{\\rm th}$ grade in increasing order is the median (since there are $13$ grades smaller than it and $13$ grades larger than it). The chart makes it easy to read off the grades in increasing order -- we just read across the rows, from top to bottom. The $14^{\\rm th}$ entry is $78,$ so that's the median grade.\n\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring grade. In this case, it's $86,$ which appears four times in the chart.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the median and mode of the data is $\\dfrac{1}{2}(78+86),$ or $\\boxed{82}.$"
