At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEveryone in a class of 35 students takes math and history. 8 students received an A in history, 15 received an A in math and 3 received an A in both courses. How many students did not receive an A in either course?",
        "inference": "1. Students who received an A in history: 8\n2. Students who received an A in math: 15\n3. Students who received an A in both history and math: 3\n4. Students who received an A in either history or math: 8 + 15 - 3 = 20\n5. Students who did not receive an A in either course: 35 - 20 = 15\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Adding the numbers of students with A's in history and math gives $8+15 = 23$.  But this counts the 3 kids who got A's in both twice, so there are $23-3=20$ different students total who received an A in at least one of the courses.  That leaves $35-20=\\boxed{15}$ who didn't get an A in either."
