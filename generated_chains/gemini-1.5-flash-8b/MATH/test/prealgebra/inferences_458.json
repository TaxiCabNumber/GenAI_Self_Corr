        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each of 8 colors, I have one shirt and one tie of that color.  How many shirt-and-tie outfits can I make if I refuse to wear a shirt and a tie of the same color?",
        "inference": "1. There are 8 colors.\n2. For each shirt color, there are 7 remaining tie colors that are not the same color as the shirt.\n3. The total number of outfits is the product of the number of shirt choices and the number of tie choices for each shirt color.\n4. Total outfits = 8 * 7 = 56\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 options for the shirt, and only 7 options for the tie because one of the ties has the same color as the shirt, so the number of outfits is $8 \\times 7 = \\boxed{56}$."
