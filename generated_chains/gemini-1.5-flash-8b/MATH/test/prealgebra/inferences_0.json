        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn and Gary are playing a game. John spins a spinner numbered with integers from 1 to 20. Gary then writes a list of all of the positive factors of the number spun except for the number itself. Gary then creates a new spinner with all of the numbers on his list. John then spins this spinner, and the process continues. The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. If John spins a 20 on his first spin, what is the maximum number of total spins (including the one he already made) that John can make before the game is over?",
        "inference": "1. Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10.\n2. Gary's list: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10.\n3. New spinner: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10.\n4. John spins the new spinner. Let's consider each possible spin:\n   - If John spins a 1, factors are 1. Gary's new list is {}. Game ends.\n   - If John spins a 2, factors are 1. Gary's new list is {}. Game ends.\n   - If John spins a 4, factors are 1, 2. Gary's new list is {1, 2}.\n   - If John spins a 5, factors are 1. Gary's new list is {1}.\n   - If John spins a 10, factors are 1, 2, 5. Gary's new list is {1, 2, 5}.\n5. Possible scenarios:\n   - 20 -> 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 -> 1, 2, 4, 5, 10\n     - Spin 1: 1, Gary's list is empty, game ends.\n     - Spin 1: 2, Gary's list is empty, game ends.\n     - Spin 1: 4, Gary's list is 1, 2, game ends.\n     - Spin 1: 5, Gary's list is 1, game ends.\n     - Spin 1: 10, Gary's list is 1, 2, 5, game ends.\n   - 20 -> 1, 2, 4, 5, 10\n      - Spin 1: 10, Gary has 1, 2, 5.\n      - Spin 2: 1, empty, game ends.\n      - Spin 2: 2, empty, game ends.\n      - Spin 2: 5, empty, game ends.\n   - 20 -> 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 -> 1, 2, 4, 5, 10\n      - Spin 1: 1, end\n      - Spin 1: 2, end\n      - Spin 1: 4, 1, 2, end (2 spins)\n      - Spin 1: 5, 1, end (2 spins)\n      - Spin 1: 10, 1, 2, 5, end (2 spins)\n6. The maximum number of spins occurs when each spinner contains the largest possible number of factors excluding the number itself. This corresponds to the numbers with the most factors: 10 has factors 1, 2, 5. The sequence of numbers in the spinner will have 4 or less numbers, and the maximum number of factors in each turn will be 5 factors. Since each spin has a number on the spinner that is not 1, there will be at most 5 numbers, then 4 numbers, and so on. So the possible numbers are 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1, this sequence can have at most 5+4+3+2+1 = 15 spins.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$",
        "ground_truth": "If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.\n\nIf John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.\n\nIf John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.\n\nIf John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.\n\nIf John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.\n\nFinally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.\n\nThus, of all of the possibilities, spinning a 4 or 10 next could result in 3 additional spins, so the maximum total number of spins is $\\boxed{4}$. These would be achieved by spinning 20, 10, 2, 1 or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1."
