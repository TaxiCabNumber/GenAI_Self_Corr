For each nickel she has one dime and for each dime she has one quarter. How many total coins does she have?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of nickels, $d$ be the number of dimes, and $q$ be the number of quarters.\nFor each nickel, she has one dime. So $d = n$.\nFor each dime, she has one quarter. So $q = d = n$.\nThe total value in dollars is $1.20 = \\$1.20$.\nThe value of the nickels is $0.05n$, the value of the dimes is $0.10d = 0.10n$, and the value of the quarters is $0.25q = 0.25n$.\nThe total value is $0.05n + 0.10n + 0.25n = 1.20$.\n$0.40n = 1.20$\n$n = \\frac{1.20}{0.40} = 3$\nSince $d = n$ and $q = n$, we have $d = 3$ and $q = 3$.\nThe total number of coins is $n + d + q = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
