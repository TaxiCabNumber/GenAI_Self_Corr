By what percent does the square's area decrease?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $A$ be the area of the square. The lengths of one pair of opposite sides was decreased by $40\\%$, so the area became $.6A$. The other pair of sides were increased by $50\\%$, so the area became $1.5\\cdot .6 A = .9A$. Thus, the area decreased by $\\boxed{10}$ percent."
