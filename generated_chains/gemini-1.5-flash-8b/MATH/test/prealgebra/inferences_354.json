If the perimeter of one of the triangles is 39 inches, what is the perimeter of the regular hexagon, in inches?",
        "inference": "1. Since the hexagon is divided into six congruent equilateral triangles, each triangle has the same side length.\n2. The perimeter of one equilateral triangle is 39 inches.\n3. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides.  Therefore, each side of the triangle is 39 inches / 3 = 13 inches.\n4. The perimeter of the hexagon is the sum of the lengths of its six sides.
