        "inference": "Let the lengths of the two legs be $a$ and $b$.\nSince the lengths of the other two sides are consecutive integers, let the hypotenuse be $c$ and $c-1$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\nCase 1: $c-1$ and $c$ are the legs.\nLet $a = c-1$ and $b = x$.  Then $(c-1)^2 + x^2 = c^2$, which implies $c^2 - 2c + 1 + x^2 = c^2$, or $x^2 = 2c - 1$.\nThe two legs are $a = 9$ and $b = x = 40$.\n$a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 + 40^2 = 81 + 1600 = 1681$.\n$c^2 = 1681$, so $c = \\sqrt{1681} = 41$.  Then $c-1 = 40$.\nSo the sides are 9, 40, 41. The perimeter is $9 + 40 + 41 = 90$.\n\nCase 2: $c-1$ and $c$ are legs.  Let $a = 9$ and $b = c-1$.
