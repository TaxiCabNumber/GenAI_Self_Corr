At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy brother is 4 times as old as I am. Six years from now, he will be twice as old as I will be.  How old is my brother now?",
        "inference": "Let my current age be 'x' years.\nMy brother's current age is 4x years.\nSix years from now, my age will be x + 6 years.\nSix years from now, my brother's age will be 4x + 6 years.\nAccording to the problem, six years from now, my brother will be twice as old as I will be.\nSo, 4x + 6 = 2(x + 6)\n4x + 6 = 2x + 12\n4x - 2x = 12 - 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\nMy current age is 3 years.\nMy brother's current age is 4x = 4 * 3 = 12 years.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \\[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \\boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)"
