At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSam is carrying a 2 gallon bucket of milk to his house from the barn, which is 3 miles away from his house. However, the bucket has a leak in it. For each mile he walks, there is $\\frac{2}{3}$ as much milk in the bucket as at the beginning of the mile. How many gallons of milk will be in the bucket when Sam gets home?",
        "inference": "Let the initial amount of milk in the bucket be $M_0 = 2$ gallons.\nAfter walking 1 mile, the amount of milk in the bucket is $M_1 = M_0 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$ gallons.\nAfter walking 2 miles, the amount of milk in the bucket is $M_2 = M_1 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{9}$ gallons.\nAfter walking 3 miles, the amount of milk in the bucket is $M_3 = M_2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{16}{27}$ gallons.\nThe amount of milk remaining after walking $n$ miles is $M_n = M_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n$. In this case, $n=3$.\n$M_3 = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 2 \\times \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{16}{27}$ gallons.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{27}}$ gallons. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "At the end of the first mile, there will be $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the initial milk in the bucket. Each additional mile multiplies this amount by $\\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, when he arrives at home at the end of the third mile, there will be $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{3}$ as much milk in the bucket. Since he had 2 gallons initially, the amount in the bucket when he gets home is $2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{3}$. Because $\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)^{n} = \\frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, this expression is equivalent to $2 \\cdot \\frac{2^{3}}{3^{3}}$. Because $n^{a} \\cdot n^{b} = n^{a+b}$, this equals $\\frac{2^{4}}{3^{3}}$. Multiplying the exponents out, we get $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{27}}$ gallons."
