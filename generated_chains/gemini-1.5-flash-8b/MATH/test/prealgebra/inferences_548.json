At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average American consumes 1483 pounds of candy in a lifetime. Assuming that 1 year $=$ 52 weeks and the average life-span is 75 years, how many pounds of candy per week does the average American consume? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total pounds of candy consumed in a lifetime: 1483 pounds.\n2. Calculate the total number of weeks in a lifetime: 75 years * 52 weeks/year = 3900 weeks.\n3. Calculate the pounds of candy consumed per week: 1483 pounds / 3900 weeks = 0.38025641 pounds/week.\n4. Round the result to the nearest hundredth: 0.38 pounds/week.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.38}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each year, an average American consumes $1483/75$ pounds of candy. Each week, an average American consumes $\\frac{1483}{75\\cdot52}=\\frac{1483}{3900}\\approx\\boxed{.38}$ pounds of candy."
