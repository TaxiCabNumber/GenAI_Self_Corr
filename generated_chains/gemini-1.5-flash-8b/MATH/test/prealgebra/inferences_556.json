        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo 6-sided dice, one red and one green, are rolled.  What is the probability that the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5?",
        "inference": "The probability of the red die showing a 2 is 1/6.\nThe probability of the green die showing a 5 is 1/6.\nSince the two events are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n(1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/36}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We solve this problem by counting outcomes.  There is only 1 successful outcome: a red 2 and a green 5.  Rolling each die is an independent event, so we multiply the 6 possible outcomes for the red die by the 6 possible outcomes for the green die, to get 36 total outcomes.  Hence the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$."
