At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe integer 49 can be written as the sum of smaller perfect squares in a variety of ways. One such way includes six terms: $25 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1$. If each term has a value between 0 and 49, what is the fewest number of perfect square terms smaller than 49 that can be added together for a sum of 49?",
        "inference": "1. The perfect squares less than 49 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.\n2. We want to minimize the number of terms.\n3. 49 is the sum of perfect squares.\n4. Start with the largest possible perfect square, 36.\n5. 49 - 36 = 13\n6. The remaining perfect squares are 9, 4, 1.\n7. 13 = 9 + 4\n8. So, 49 = 36 + 9 + 4.\n9. There are three terms: 36, 9, and 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",

        "inference": "To express 49 as a sum of the fewest number of perfect squares, we start with the largest possible perfect square less than or equal to 49, which is 49 itself.  However, we want to find the fewest perfect squares.  If we use 49, we have 49 = 49.  This is one term, but not the fewest.\n\nIf we subtract 36, the next largest perfect square, from 49, we get 13.  Now we see if we can express 13 as a sum of perfect squares.  13 = 9 + 4.  Therefore, 49 = 36 + 9 + 4.  This uses three terms.  No other combination of perfect squares less than 49 will sum to 49 using fewer than three terms.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$",
