        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChris and Nathan order a giant cookie together. If Chris eats $\\frac{2}{7}$ of the cookie and Nathan eats $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the cookie, what fraction of the original cookie is left?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total fraction of the cookie eaten by Chris and Nathan: $\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{7 \\times 5} + \\frac{3 \\times 7}{5 \\times 7} = \\frac{10}{35} + \\frac{21}{35} = \\frac{31}{35}$.\n\n2. Subtract the fraction eaten from the whole cookie (which is represented by 1): $1 - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{4}{35}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{35}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total amount eaten is $\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{5}$. The denominators have a common multiple of 35, so this is equivalent to $\\frac{10}{35} + \\frac{21}{35} = \\frac{10 + 21}{35} = \\frac{31}{35}$. Thus, the amount that Chris and Nathan didn't eat is $1 - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} - \\frac{31}{35} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{35}}.$"
