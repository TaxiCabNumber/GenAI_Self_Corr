        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees.\nLet the two congruent acute angles be x.\nThe other three interior angles are each equal to 2x.\nThus, 2x + 2x + 2x + x + x = 540\n8x = 540\nx = 540/8 = 67.5\nThe large angles are 2x = 2 * 67.5 = 135\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \\[\nx+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \\implies 8x = 540 \\implies x=135/2.\n\\] The large angles each measure $2x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
