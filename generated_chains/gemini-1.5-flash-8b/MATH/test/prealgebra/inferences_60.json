        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA railroad trestle spans a gorge 80 feet wide and connects two cliffs at heights of 112 and 172 feet above the bottom of the gorge. A train is crossing this gorge from the higher cliff to the lower. When the front of the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length, how many feet is it above the bottom of the gorge?",
        "inference": "1. The difference in height is 172 - 112 = 60 feet.\n2. The trestle's length can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let the length be L.  We have $L^2 = 80^2 + 60^2 = 6400 + 3600 = 10000$. So, $L = \\sqrt{10000} = 100$ feet.\n3. The front of the train has traveled 3/4 of the trestle's length, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 feet.\n4.  We need to find the height above the bottom of the gorge.  The height difference (60 feet) is distributed over the entire length (100 feet).  The rate of change of height is 60/100 = 0.6 feet per foot.\n5. When the front of the train has traveled 75 feet, the height is the starting height (112 feet) + 75 feet * 0.6 = 112 + 45 = 157 feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{157}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the railroad trestle is a straight path connecting the two cliffs, we know that after the train has traveled $3/4$ of the trestle's length, the train has traveled both $3/4$ the horizontal distance between the two cliffs and the $3/4$ of the vertical distance between the cliffs' heights. The difference between the heights of the two cliffs is $172-112=60$ feet. $3/4$ of that difference is $45$ feet. Since the train started from the higher cliff and was moving toward the lower cliff, it has descended $45$ feet from its original altitude of $172$ feet. Therefore, the train is now $172-45=\\boxed{127}$ feet above the bottom of the gorge."
