        "inference": "There are 52 cards in a standard deck.\nThere are 4 Queens (one in each suit).\nThere are 13 diamonds.\nThere are 1 Queen of diamonds.\n\nNumber of Queens = 4\nNumber of diamonds = 13\nNumber of cards that are both a Queen and a diamond = 1 (Queen of diamonds)\n\nUsing the addition rule for probabilities, the number of cards that are a Queen or a diamond is:\nNumber of Queens + Number of diamonds - Number of cards that are both a Queen and a diamond\n= 4 + 13 - 1 = 16\n\nThe probability that the card is a Queen or a diamond (or both) is\n$\\frac{16}{52} = \\frac{4}{13}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 52 possible outcomes, since there are 52 cards we can choose. There are 4 ways to choose a Queen, and there are 13 ways to choose a $\\diamondsuit$, but the outcomes are not mutually exclusive!  We might choose the Queen of $\\diamondsuit$, which belongs to both outcomes.  So we must subtract one to correct for this overcounting.  Thus are are $17-1 = 16$ successful outcomes, and the probability is $\\frac{16}{52} =\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}$."
