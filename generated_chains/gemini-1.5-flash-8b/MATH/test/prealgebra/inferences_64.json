        "inference": "To find the height, we need the perpendicular distance from the point (2,3) to the line segment from (0,0) to (10,0).  The line segment from (0,0) to (10,0) is the x-axis, which has equation y=0. The perpendicular distance from a point (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) to the line y = 0 is simply |y<sub>1</sub>|.  In this case, the point is (2,3), so the height is |3| = 3 cm. The base is 10 cm.  Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 10 * 3 = 15 cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\n$\\boxed{15}$\n",
