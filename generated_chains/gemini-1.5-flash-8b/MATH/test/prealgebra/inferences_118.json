At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded in half to form a rectangle. If the resulting rectangle has a perimeter of 18 inches, what is the area of the original square, in square inches?",

        "inference": "The problem states the perimeter of the *rectangle* is 18 inches.  The rectangle's dimensions are length = s inches and width = s/2 inches.  The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(s + s/2) = 2(3s/2) = 3s.  So, 3s = 18, which gives s = 6 inches.  The area of the square is s\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36 square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$",
