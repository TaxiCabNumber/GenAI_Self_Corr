At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen 700 students from Genius M.S. played SCOOZ, 90$\\%$ of them scored ''proficient or above.'' What number of students at Genius M.S. did not score ''proficient or above?''",

Find the number of students who did not score proficient or above:\n   Total students - Students who scored proficient or above = 700 - 630 = 70 students\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{70}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $90\\%$ scored proficient or above, that means $10\\%$ did not, and $10\\%$ of 700 is $\\frac{1}{10}\\times 700 = \\boxed{70}$ students."
