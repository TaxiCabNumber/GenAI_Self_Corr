        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a right triangle have equal perimeters.  The legs of the right triangle are 20 inches and 15 inches.  What is the area of the square, in square inches?",
        "inference": "1. **Perimeter of the right triangle:**\n   The perimeter is 20 + 15 + hypotenuse.\n   To find the hypotenuse, use the Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse\u00b2 = 20\u00b2 + 15\u00b2 = 400 + 225 = 625.\n   So, hypotenuse = \u221a625 = 25 inches.\n   Perimeter of the triangle = 20 + 15 + 25 = 60 inches.\n\n2. **Perimeter of the square:**\n   The perimeter of the square is also 60 inches.  Let 's' be the side length of the square.  Then 4s = 60.\n   Therefore, s = 60 / 4 = 15 inches.\n\n3. **Area of the square:**\n   Area = side \u00d7 side = 15 \u00d7 15 = 225 square inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{225}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The legs of the right triangle are in a $3:4$ ratio, so the right triangle is similar to a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle and thus it has hypotenuse $5\\cdot 5 = 25$.  The perimeter of the right triangle is then $15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.  Then the square has side length $60/4=15$ and area $15^2 = \\boxed{225}$ square inches."

        "inference": "The problem states that the perimeter of a right triangle is the same as the perimeter of a square.  The perimeter of the right triangle is given as 60 inches.  The area of the square is calculated correctly.\n\nThe problem states the triangle has sides 15 and 20 inches, and asks for the area of the square.  The sides are 15 and 20 inches, and the hypotenuse is 25 inches.  The perimeter of the triangle is 60 inches, the same as the perimeter of the square.  A square with perimeter 60 inches has a side length of 15 inches.  The area of the square is 15 * 15 = 225 square inches.\n\n$\\boxed{225}$\n",
