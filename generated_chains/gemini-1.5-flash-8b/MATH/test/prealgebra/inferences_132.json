        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBekah has exactly three brass house number digits: 2, 3 and 5. How many distinct numbers can she form using one or more of the digits?",
        "inference": "1 digit numbers: 2, 3, 5  (3 possibilities)\n2 digit numbers: 23, 25, 32, 35, 52, 53 (6 possibilities)\n3 digit numbers: 235, 253, 325, 352, 523, 532 (6 possibilities)\n\nTotal possibilities = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If Bekah uses only one digit, she can form three numbers. If she uses two digits, she has three choices for the tens place and two for the units, so she can form six numbers. Finally, if Bekah uses all three digits, she has three choices for the hundreds place, two for the tens, and one for the units, so she can form six numbers. Thus, Bekah can form $3 + 6 + 6 = \\boxed{15}$ distinct numbers."
