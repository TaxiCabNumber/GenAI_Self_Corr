        "inference": "The problem statement is flawed.  It's impossible to have 12 chocolate, 16 raisin, 6 chocolate chip, and 4 nut cupcakes *without* overlap. The problem needs to be clarified.  If the problem was supposed to ask for the number of cupcakes with no ingredients, then the answer is 0.  If the number of cupcakes with any combination of ingredients is greater than 24, then there is a contradiction.
