At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSolve for $x$: $3x-(1-x)=5$. Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest form.",
        "inference": "1. Distribute the 3 on the left side: $3x - 1 + x = 5$\n2. Combine like terms: $4x - 1 = 5$\n3. Add 1 to both sides: $4x = 6$\n4. Divide both sides by 4: $x = \\frac{6}{4}$\n5. Simplify the fraction: $x = \\frac{3}{2}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Distributing the negation gives  \\[3x - 1 - (-x) = 5,\\] so  \\[3x - 1 + x = 5.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $4x - 1 = 5$.  Adding 1 to both sides gives $4x = 6$, and dividing by 4 gives $x = \\frac64 = \\boxed{\\frac32}$."
