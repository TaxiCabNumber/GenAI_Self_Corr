I hope it is correct.'\nThe same eight people sit in a certain church pew every week, but not always in the same order. Every week, each person hugs the people immediately to his or her left and right. How many weeks does it take (at a minimum) for every pair of people to hug at least once?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nLet the eight people be represented by the numbers 1 to 8.\nIn the first week, person 1 hugs person 2 and person 8.\nIn the second week, person 2 hugs person 1 and person 3.\n...\nIn the eighth week, person 8 hugs person 7 and person 1.\n\nIn the first week, person 1 hugs person 2 and person 8.
