At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "1. The smallest prime number is 2.  If we consider sums of two prime numbers, the smallest sum of two distinct prime numbers is 2 + 3 = 5.\n2.  5 is prime.\n3.  The next prime number to consider is 7. Possible pairs are 2+5=7, 3+4=7, but 4 is not prime.  2+5=7 and 3+5=8. So, 2+5=7 works.\n4.  The next prime to consider is 11. Possible pairs are 2+9 (9 is not prime), 3+8 (8 is not prime), 5+6(6 is not prime), 7+4 (4 is not prime). 5+7 =12, which is not prime. \n5.  Possible pairs of distinct prime numbers are 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 2+5=7, 3+7=10, 5+7=12. 2+3 = 5 which is prime. 3+5=8, which is not prime.  2+5=7 which is prime. \n6.  We have found that 5 is the sum of 2 and 3. 7 is the sum of 2 and 5.\n7.  The smallest prime number that is the sum of two other distinct prime numbers is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The two smallest prime numbers are 2 and 3, and $2+3=5$ is also prime. Therefore, $\\boxed{5}$ is the smallest prime number that is the sum of two other distinct primes.\n\nNote: If $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, then $p+q$ is an even number greater than 7 and is therefore composite.  So the only sets of three primes for which two primes sum to the third are of the form $\\{2,p,p+2\\}$."
