At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 20 cars in my building's parking lot.  All of the cars are red or white.  Also, all the cars are either 2-door or 4-door.  12 of them are red, 15 of them are 4-door, and 4 of them are 2-door and white.  How many of the cars are 4-door and red?",

Total 2-door cars: Let 'x' be the number of 2-door red cars.\n   Total white cars = 20 - 12 = 8\n   Total 2-door cars = x + 4\n   Total 4-door white cars = 8 - 4 = 4\n\n6.

Number of 4-door red cars: \n   Total red cars - (2-door red cars) = 12 - 1 = 11\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, the number of red 2-door cars is $12-x$, while the number of white 4-door cars is $15-x$.  The sum of the number of red 4-doors, red 2-doors, white 4-doors, and white 2-doors is the total number of cars (20), because each car is contained in exactly one of these categories.  Since the number of white 2-doors is 4, we have $x + (12 - x) + (15 - x) + 4 = 20$, which makes $x = \\boxed{11}$."

        "inference": "The problem statement is confusing and contradictory.  We are given that the total number of cars is 20, but then also told that the total 2-door cars + total 4-door cars = 20. This is redundant.  The information is not sufficient to uniquely determine the number of 4-door red cars.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n1. Red cars: 12\n2. 4-door cars: 15\n3. 2-door white cars: 4\n4. Total cars: 20\n\nThis information is inconsistent.  If there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, then there must be at least 3 more 4-door cars than the total cars, which is impossible.  Also, the total number of cars cannot be 20.\n\nFrom the given information we cannot determine a unique answer.\nMore information is needed to solve the question.\n\n$\\boxed{cannot be determined}$\n",
