At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA suitcase lock has 4 dials with the digits $0, 1, 2,..., 9$ on each. How many different settings are possible if all four digits have to be different?",
        "inference": "There are 10 choices for the first dial.\nSince the digits have to be different, there are 9 choices for the second dial.\nThen there are 8 choices for the third dial.\nFinally, there are 7 choices for the fourth dial.\n\nThe number of different settings is $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 5040$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5040}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 10 possibilities for the first digit. After the first digit has been chosen, there are 9 possibilities for the second digit.  After these two digits have been chosen, there are 8 possibilities for the third digit and after the first three digits have been chosen there are 7 possibilities for the last digit. The total number of possible settings is $10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot7=\\boxed{5040}$."
