I hope it is correct.'\nA 420-page book contains an average of 600 words per page, and Roslyn reads the book at the rate of 360 words per minute. How many hours did it take her to read the book? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "Total words = 420 pages * 600 words/page = 252000 words\nTotal time in minutes = 252000 words / 360 words/minute = 700 minutes\nTotal time in hours = 700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 11.666... hours\n11.666... hours = 11 hours and 0.666... * 60 minutes = 11 hours and 40 minutes\n11 hours + 40 minutes/60 = 11 hours + 2/3 hours = 11 + 2/3 hours = 11 2/3 hours\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11 \\frac{2}{3}}$ hours.
