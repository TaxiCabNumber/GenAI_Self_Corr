        "inference": "Angle 1 and the angle adjacent to it form a straight line, so they are supplementary angles.  Therefore, the angle adjacent to angle 1 is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.  Since $l_1$ is parallel to $l_2$ and $m_2$ is perpendicular to $l_2$, the angle formed by $m_2$ and $l_2$ is 90 degrees.  The angle adjacent to this 90-degree angle also on $l_2$ is 90 degrees.  The angle adjacent to the angle measuring 130 degrees and forming a straight line with it is 50 degrees, making the two angles complementary.\n\nThe angle adjacent to angle 2 on $l_1$ and the angle of 130 degrees are supplementary, and they sum to 180 degrees.  The other angle on $l_1$  that is next to the 130-degree angle measures 50 degrees.  Therefore the angle adjacent to angle 2 is 130 degrees.  The angle 2 and the 130-degree angle are on the same straight line, $l_1$. Therefore, the angles are supplementary. This implies that 2 + 130 = 180, so angle 2 = 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$",
