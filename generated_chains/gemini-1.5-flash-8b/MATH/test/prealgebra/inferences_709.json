The first term is 25, and the last term is 100. The common difference is 1.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, $a_n = 100$, $a_1 = 25$, and $d = 1$.\n\nWe have $100 = 25 + (n-1)(1)$.\n\n$100 = 25 + n - 1$\n$100 = 24 + n$\n$n = 100 - 24$\n$n = 76$\n\nTherefore, there are 76 numbers in the list.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{76}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
