At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are ten meerkats in a colony. Every night, two meerkats stand guard while the others sleep. During a certain period of nights, every meerkat stands guard with every other meerkat exactly once. During that period, how many nights of sleep does each meerkat get?",

        "inference": "There are 10 meerkats.  Each pair of meerkats stands guard exactly once.  This means there are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ pairs.  Each night, 2 meerkats stand guard, so there are 45 guard shifts in total.  Since there are 10 meerkats, and each stands guard 9 times, the number of nights is 45/2 = 22.5, which is not an integer. This means each pair of meerkats must stand guard twice. To resolve this, we need to have every meerkat stand guard 9 times. That means 9 guard shifts per meerkat.  If each meerkat stands guard 9 times, then 10 meerkats total will have 90 guard shifts.\nWe need to make pairs such that there are 2 meerkats standing guard each night,  and every meerkat has the opportunity to stand guard with every other meerkat exactly once.\n\nWe want to find the number of nights required for every pair to stand guard exactly once.  Each night there are 2 meerkats on guard. So 45 pairs need to be watched over.\n\nSince each night there are 2 meerkats standing guard and every pair of meerkats stands guard exactly once, we need 45 pairs. There are 2 meerkats standing guard each night. Therefore, the total number of nights required is $\\frac{45}{2}$ or $45/2=22.5$.  This doesn't make sense.\n\nThe total number of guard shifts is the number of pairs, which is 45.  Each meerkat stands guard 9 times. This means that there must be 9 nights for each meerkat to stand guard.\nTo make sure each pair stands guard exactly once, we have to divide the 45 total pairs in two. So there will be 45 / 2 = 22.5 nights which is impossible.  Therefore, the number of nights must be 45 / 2 = 22.5 which is not an integer.\n\nTo have every pair stand guard exactly once, each meerkat must stand guard with every other meerkat exactly once. That means each meerkat stands guard 9 times. Since there are two meerkats per night, there must be 9 nights for each meerkat.  Since there are 10 meerkats, and each needs to stand guard 9 times, the total number of nights will be 9 nights.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$",
