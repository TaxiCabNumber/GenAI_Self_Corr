I hope it is correct.'\nA hot air balloon is 10 feet off the ground and is rising at a constant rate of 2 feet per second. What is the height of the balloon, in feet, after 25 more seconds?",
        "inference": "1. The initial height is 10 feet.\n2. The balloon rises at a constant rate of 2 feet per second.\n3. The balloon rises for 25 more seconds.\n4. The height gained in 25 seconds is 2 feet/second * 25 seconds = 50 feet.\n5. The total height after 25 more seconds is 10 feet + 50 feet = 60 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "During these 25 seconds, the balloon will rise $2\\cdot25=50$ feet. The total height is then $10+50=\\boxed{60}$ feet."
