        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?",
        "inference": "Let the negative number be $x$.\nThe problem states that when $x$ is multiplied by 6, the result is the same as 20 less than the original number.  This translates to the equation:\n$6x = x - 20$.\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides gives:\n$5x = -20$.\nDividing both sides by 5 gives:\n$x = -4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $6x=x-20$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5x=-20$. Then, dividing both sides by 5 gives $x= \\boxed{-4}$."
