At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a set of five positive integers whose average (mean) is 5, whose median is 5, and whose only mode is 8. What is the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the set?",
        "inference": "1. The median is 5, so the middle number in the sorted set is 5.\n2. The average is 5, and there are 5 numbers, so the sum of the numbers is 5 * 5 = 25.\n3. The mode is 8, which means 8 appears at least twice in the set. Since the median is 5, and the mode is 8, the set must look like this, sorted from least to greatest: a, b, 5, 8, 8.\n4.
