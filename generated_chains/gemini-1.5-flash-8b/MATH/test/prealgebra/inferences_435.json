        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Price's Market, four oranges cost one dollar. How much, in dollars, will 10 oranges cost at Price's Market?",
        "inference": "Four oranges cost $1.\nTo find the cost of one orange, divide the cost of four oranges by 4:\n$1 / 4 = $0.25 per orange.\nTo find the cost of 10 oranges, multiply the cost per orange by 10:\n$0.25 * 10 = $2.50.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$2.50}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have the ratio $4 \\text{ oranges} : \\$1$. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $20 \\text{ oranges} : \\$5$. Dividing by 2, we get $10 \\text{ oranges} : \\$2.50$. Thus, 10 oranges at Price's Market cost $\\boxed{\\$2.50}$."
