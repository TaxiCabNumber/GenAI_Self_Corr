At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$?",
        "inference": "The decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$. The repeating block has length 6.\nTo find the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit to the right of the decimal point, we need to find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 6.\n$2007 \\div 6 = 334$ with a remainder of 3.\nThe $3^{\\text{rd}}$ digit in the repeating block is 2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, which repeats every six digits. Since 2007 divided by 6 has a remainder of 3, the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
