At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKarla drove her vehicle 12,000 miles last year. How many gallons of gasoline would she have saved last year had she driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon rather than an SUV averaging 15 miles per gallon?",
        "inference": "SUV gallons = 12000 miles / 15 mpg = 800 gallons\nHybrid gallons = 12000 miles / 48 mpg = 250 gallons\nSavings = 800 gallons - 250 gallons = 550 gallons\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{550}$ gallons. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons."
