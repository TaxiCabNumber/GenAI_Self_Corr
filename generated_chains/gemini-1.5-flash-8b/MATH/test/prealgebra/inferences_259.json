At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the positive integer be $n$. We are looking for integers $n$ such that $n < 500$ and $n = 5k$ for some even integer $k$.\nThis means $n$ is a multiple of 5 and $k$ is an even integer.\nThus, $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\nThen $n = 5k = 5(2m) = 10m$.\nWe want to find the largest positive integer $m$ such that $10m < 500$.\nDividing both sides by 10, we have $m < 50$.\nSo, $m$ can be any positive integer from 1 to 49.\nTherefore, there are 49 such integers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{49}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "An even integer is a multiple of 2. The integers we are looking for are multiples of 2 and 5, so they are multiples of 10. The largest multiple of 10 less than 500 is $490 = 49 \\cdot 10$, and the smallest positive multiple of 10 is $10 = 1 \\cdot 10$. Our list also includes every multiple of 10 between 10 and 490, so there are a total of $\\boxed{49}$ positive integers less than 500 that are equal to 5 times an even integer."
