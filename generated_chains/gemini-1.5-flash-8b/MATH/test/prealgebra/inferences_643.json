        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the square be $s$.\nThe area of the square is $s^2 = 49$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $s = 7$ inches.\nWhen the square is folded so that one pair of opposite corners coincide, the fold line is a diagonal of the square.\nThe diagonal of a square with side length $s$ is $s\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, the diagonal of the square is $7\\sqrt{2}$ inches.\nThe folded paper forms two congruent isosceles triangles.\nThe base of each triangle is a side of the square, which is 7 inches.\nThe two legs of each triangle are the half of the diagonal of the square, which is $\\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ inches.\nThe perimeter of one of these triangles is the sum of its three sides.\nPerimeter $= 7 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{7\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 7 + 7\\sqrt{2}$ inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7+7\\sqrt{2}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{14+7\\sqrt{2}}$."
