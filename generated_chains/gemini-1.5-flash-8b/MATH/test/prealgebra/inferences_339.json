        "inference": "1. Add 3 to both sides of the inequality:\n   $-3n + 3 + 3 > -11 + 3$\n   $-3n + 6 > -8$\n\n2. Subtract 6 from both sides:\n   $-3n > -8 - 6$\n   $-3n > -14$\n\n3. Divide both sides by -3. Remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number:\n   $n < \\frac{-14}{-3}$\n   $n < \\frac{14}{3}$\n   $n < 4\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n4. The positive integers that satisfy this inequality are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n5. Sum the positive integers:\n   $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Adding $3n+11$ to both sides, we get $$-3n+3+3n+11 > -11+3n+11,$$ which simplifies to $$14 > 3n.$$ Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $$4\\frac 23 > n.$$ The integer solutions are $n=1,2,3,4$, and their sum is $\\boxed{10}$."
