        "inference": "The side length of the equilateral triangle is 2. The angle between the side and the x-axis is 60 degrees.  We need to find the x-coordinate of a point on the side of the triangle.  This implies we are looking for the x-coordinate of a point on one of the sides of the equilateral triangle.  The x-coordinate of a point on the side of the triangle that makes a 60-degree angle with the x-axis will have a projection onto the x-axis. The triangle's height is \u221a3.  To get to a point on the equilateral triangle from the origin, we project onto the x-axis to get x, and then to the height of \u221a3, we use a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 2. The projection onto the x-axis is the length x such that the cosine of 60 degrees is x/2. Then x = 2cos(60\u00b0) = 2(1/2) = 1. So the x-coordinate is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$",
