The total area of the four rectangles is $4(2x^2)=8x^2$ and the total area of the four squares is $4(x^2)=4x^2$, so the area of the unshaded regions is $4x^2+8x^2=12x^2$.  Then the shaded area is $9x^2-12x^2 = -3x^2$.  This can't be right.\nThe area of the large square is $s^2$.\nThe side length of the large square is $3x+2x = 5x$.  So $s = 5x$.\nThe area of the large square is $s^2=(5x)^2=25x^2$.\nThe total area of the four small squares is $4x^2$.\nThe total area of the four vertical rectangles is $4(2x^2) = 8x^2$.\nThe total area of the unshaded regions is $4x^2 + 8x^2 = 12x^2$.\nThe shaded area is $25x^2 - 12x^2 = 13x^2$.\nThe fraction of the total area of the shaded regions is $\\frac{13x^2}{25x^2} = \\frac{13}{25}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{25}}$",
