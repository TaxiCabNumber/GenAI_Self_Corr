At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can the letters of the word ``COPYRIGHT'' be arranged?",

        "ground_truth": "Since there are no repeated letters, we see that there are 9 possible choices for the first letter, 8 possible choices for the second letter, 7 possible choices for the third letter, and so on.
