        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCharlie is riding on his unicycle. If the unicycle's wheel has a radius of 9 inches and makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, what is the unicycle's speed in inches per second?",
        "inference": "1. Find the circumference of the wheel:  Circumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius = 2 * \u03c0 * 9 inches = 18\u03c0 inches.\n\n2. Find the distance traveled in 3 seconds:  Distance = (circumference) * (number of revolutions) = (18\u03c0 inches) * (2 revolutions) = 36\u03c0 inches.\n\n3. Calculate the speed: Speed = distance / time = (36\u03c0 inches) / (3 seconds) = 12\u03c0 inches/second.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12\\pi}$ inches per second. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We need to know how many inches are in one revolution of the unicycle's wheel. In other words, we need to know the circumference of the wheel. Since the radius is $9$ inches, the circumference is $18\\pi$ inches. So, if there are $18\\pi$ inches in one revolution, and the wheel makes $2$ revolutions every $3$ seconds, the unicycle's speed is $18\\pi\\cdot\\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{12\\pi}$ inches per second."
