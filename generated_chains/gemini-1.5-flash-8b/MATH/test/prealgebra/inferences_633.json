        "ground_truth": "We know that 1/16 of a pound of cookie dough can make one cookie and we know that Annie has 3/2 pounds of cookie dough. To find the number of cookies that she can make, we have to find how many 1/16s there are in 3/2. This is the same as asking \"what is 3/2 divided by 1/16?\" so we want to find $$\\frac{3}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{16}.$$We remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal and the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{16}$ is $\\frac{16}{1}$. Therefore, we have that $$\\frac{3}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{16}{1} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 16}{2} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24.$$Annie can make $\\boxed{24}$ cookies."
