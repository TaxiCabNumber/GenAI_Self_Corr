At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn right triangle $ABC$, the length of side $BC$ is 2 units, the length of side $AC$ is 4 units and the measure of angle $C$ is 60 degrees. What is the length of side $AB$, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
