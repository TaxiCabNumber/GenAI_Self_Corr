At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA birdbath is designed to overflow so that it will be self-cleaning.  Water flows in at the rate of 20 milliliters per minute and drains at the rate of 18 milliliters per minute.  One of these graphs shows the volume of water in the birdbath during the filling time and continuing into the overflow time.

        "inference": "The water flows in at a rate of 20 milliliters per minute, and drains at a rate of 18 milliliters per minute. This means that the net rate of change of the volume of water in the birdbath is 20 - 18 = 2 milliliters per minute.  The volume increases steadily for a period.  Then, the volume levels off at a constant value.  Graph D shows this behavior.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{D}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Initially, volume increases with time as shown by graphs $A$, $C$, and $E$.  But once the birdbath is full, the volume remains constant as the birdbath overflows.  Only graph $\\boxed{A}$ shows both features."
