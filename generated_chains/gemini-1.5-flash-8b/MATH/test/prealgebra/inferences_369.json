        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn parallelogram $PQRS$, the measure of angle $P$ is five times the measure of angle $Q$. What is the measure of angle $R$, in degrees?",
        "inference": "In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.  Also, consecutive angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).\nLet the measure of angle Q be $x$. Then the measure of angle P is $5x$.\nSince angles P and Q are consecutive, $P + Q = 180$.\nSubstituting the expressions for P and Q, we get $5x + x = 180$.\n$6x = 180$.\n$x = 30$.\nSo angle Q is 30 degrees and angle P is $5(30) = 150$ degrees.\nAngle R is equal to angle P, so angle R = 150 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, while opposite angles are equal.  So $P + Q = 180 = 5Q + Q$, implying that $Q = 30$.  Thus $P = \\boxed{150} = R$, and we are done."
