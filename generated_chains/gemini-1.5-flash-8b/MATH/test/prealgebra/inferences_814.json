At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side. The perimeter of the domino is 60 units. What is the area of the domino, in square units?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of a domino is 60 units.  A domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side.  This means the perimeter is made up of 4 sides of the squares. Thus, 2 * side length of a square + 2 * side length of a square = 60 units.  2 * (2 * side length of a square) = 60. 4 * side length of a square = 60.  Side length of a square = 60 / 4 = 15 units. The area of a single square is side length * side length = 15 * 15 = 225 square units. The domino has two squares, so the total area is 2 * 225 = 450 square units.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{450}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the domino's short side measures $l$ units.  Then it's long side measures $2l$ units, and the domino's total perimeter is $6l = 60$.  Thus $l = 10$ and the domino's area is $10\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{200}$ square units."

        "inference": "Let the side length of each square be $s$.\nA domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side. The perimeter of the domino is the sum of the lengths of the four sides of the two squares.\nThus, the perimeter is $2s + 2s + s + s = 6s$.\nThe problem states that the perimeter is 60 units. So, $6s = 60$.\nSolving for $s$, we get $s = \\frac{60}{6} = 10$.\nThe area of a single square is $s \\times s = 10 \\times 10 = 100$ square units.\nThe domino has two squares, so the total area is $2 \\times 100 = 200$ square units.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$",
