At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe five tallest buildings in Los Angeles in 1985 had a mean height of 733 feet. The tallest of the five buildings has a height of 858 feet, the shortest of the five 625 feet. If a new building were constructed with a height of 885 feet, by how many feet would it increase the mean height of the five tallest buildings of the city?",
        "inference": "The sum of the heights of the five original buildings is 733 feet/building * 5 buildings = 3665 feet.\nThe sum of the heights of the tallest and shortest buildings is 858 feet + 625 feet = 1483 feet.\nThe sum of the heights of the three middle buildings is 3665 feet - 1483 feet = 2182 feet.\nThe new mean height of the six buildings (including the new building) is (3665 feet + 885 feet) / 6 buildings = 4550 feet / 6 buildings = 758.33 feet/building.\nThe increase in the mean height is 758.33 feet/building - 733 feet/building = 25.33 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25.33}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the mean of the heights of the 5 tallest buildings in Los Angeles before the new building was built was 733, the sum of their heights must have been $5\\cdot733 = 3665$. After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller. Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\\boxed{52}$ feet. Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5."
