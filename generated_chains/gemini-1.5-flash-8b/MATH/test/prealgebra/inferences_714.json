At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen converting $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$",
