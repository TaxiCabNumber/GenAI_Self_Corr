At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many degrees are in the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 3:30?",
        "inference": "At 3:00, the hour hand is at the 3 and the minute hand is at the 12.  This creates a 90-degree angle.\n\nFrom 3:00 to 3:30, the minute hand moves from the 12 to the 6, which is half a circle or 180 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute. In 30 minutes, it moves 30 * 6 = 180 degrees.\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, or 30 degrees per hour. In 30 minutes (0.5 hours), the hour hand moves 0.5 * 30 = 15 degrees.\n\nThe angle between the hands at 3:30 is the difference between the positions of the hour and minute hands.  The minute hand is at 180 degrees from the 12. The hour hand is at 90 + 15 = 105 degrees. The difference is |180 - 105| = 75 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

At 3:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 3 and the 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is $\\frac12\\cdot 30^\\circ = 15^\\circ$ from the 4 on the clock, and there are $2\\cdot 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ$ between the 4 and the 6 on the clock.
