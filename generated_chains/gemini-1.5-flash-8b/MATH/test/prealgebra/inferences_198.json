At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery student in the senior class is taking history or science and 85 of them are taking both. If there are 106 seniors taking history and 109 seniors taking science, how many students are in the senior class?",
        "inference": "Let H be the set of seniors taking history, and S be the set of seniors taking science.\nWe are given that every student in the senior class is taking history or science. This means that the total number of seniors is the union of the sets H and S.\nWe are given that $|H \\cap S| = 85$.\nWe are given that $|H| = 106$ and $|S| = 109$.\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n$|H \\cup S| = |H| + |S| - |H \\cap S|$\n$|H \\cup S| = 106 + 109 - 85$\n$|H \\cup S| = 215 - 85$\n$|H \\cup S| = 130$\nThe number of students in the senior class is $|H \\cup S|$.\nThus, the total number of students in the senior class is 130.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{130}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We see 106 seniors are taking history and 109 seniors are taking science. If we add those numbers of seniors up, we still have to subtract the number of seniors that are taking both history and science because we counted them twice. So there is a total of $106+109-85=\\boxed{130}$ students in the senior class."
