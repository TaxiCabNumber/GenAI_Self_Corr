        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the chocolatier, classic chocolate fudge costs 10 dollars a pound. Anna purchases $\\frac{7}{9}$ of a pound of the fudge. The cash register rounds to the nearest cent, or hundredth of a dollar. How many dollars does Anna pay for her fudge?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the cost of $\\frac{7}{9}$ of a pound of fudge: $\\frac{7}{9} \\times \\$10 = \\frac{70}{9}$ dollars.\n2. Convert the fraction to a decimal: $\\frac{70}{9} \\approx 7.7777...$ dollars.\n3. Round to the nearest cent (hundredth): $7.78$ dollars.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$7.78}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The actual cost of the fudge Anna purchases is\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{7}{9}\\cdot 10 &= 0.\\overline{7}\\cdot 10\\\\ &= 7.\\overline{7}\\\\ &= 7.777\\ldots \\end{align*}To round to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the thousandths place, which here is 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the hundredths place, which in $7.\\overline{7}$ is 7, up to 8. So, rounding $7.\\overline{7}$ to the nearest hundredth yields $\\boxed{7.78}$ dollars."
