At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou can get anything you want at Alberto's restaurant, as long as what you want is a sandwich with two different fillings. There are nine fillings to choose from (turkey, ham, roast beef, cheese, tomatoes, peppers, sprouts, oranges, and licorice). How many different sandwiches can you order (including the ones that nobody in their right mind would order)?",
        "inference": "We need to choose 2 fillings out of 9 different fillings.\nThe order in which we choose the fillings does not matter, so we use combinations.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 fillings from 9 fillings is given by the combination formula:\n$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\nIn this case, $n=9$ and $k=2$, so we have\n$$\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = \\frac{9!}{2!7!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{72}{2} = 36$$\nThere are 36 different sandwiches that can be ordered.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 9 options for the first filling and 8 options left for the second filling for a preliminary count of $9\\cdot8=72$ options. However, the order of the fillings doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{9\\cdot8}{2}=\\boxed{36}$ combinations."
