        "inference": "The list is an arithmetic progression.\nThe first term is 36.\nThe common difference is 1.\nThe last term is 93.\nThe formula for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic progression is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$-th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.\nIn this case, $a_n = 93$, $a_1 = 36$, and $d = 1$.\nSo, $93 = 36 + (n-1)(1)$.\n$93 = 36 + n - 1$\n$93 = 35 + n$\n$n = 93 - 35$\n$n = 58$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{58}$",
