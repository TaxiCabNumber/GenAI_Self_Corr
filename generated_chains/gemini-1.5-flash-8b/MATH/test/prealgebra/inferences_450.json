        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 16 tablespoons in a cup. A recipe for 4 people uses 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. How many cups of garlic powder does it take to make the same recipe for 80 people? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "1. For 4 people, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder is used.\n2. For 1 person, (1 tablespoon) / 4 people = 1/4 tablespoon of garlic powder is used.\n3. For 80 people, (1/4 tablespoon) * 80 people = 20 tablespoons of garlic powder is needed.\n4. There are 16 tablespoons in a cup.\n5. To find the number of cups, divide the total tablespoons by the tablespoons per cup: 20 tablespoons / 16 tablespoons/cup = 20/16 cups.\n6. Simplify the fraction: 20/16 = 5/4 cups.\n7. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number: 5/4 = 1 1/4 cups.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Our ratio of garlic powder to people served is $\\frac{1 \\textnormal{ tablespoon}}{4 \\textnormal{ people}}$. We multiply this ratio by 80 people to get the number of tablespoons needed to serve 80 people, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 80 = 20$ tablespoons. Converting this to cups, we have $20 \\textnormal{ tablespoons} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ cup}}{16 \\textnormal{ tablespoons}} = \\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups."
