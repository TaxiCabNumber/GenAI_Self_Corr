At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $12^{\\prime \\prime}$-diameter pizza and a $16^{\\prime \\prime}$-diameter pizza are each cut into eight congruent slices. Jane ate three slices of the $12^{\\prime \\prime}$ pizza. Mark ate three slices of the $16^{\\prime \\prime}$ pizza. How many more square inches of pizza did Mark eat than Jane?

        "ground_truth": "They both ate $\\frac{3}{8}$ of a pizza.  Therefore, the quantity that Mark ate in excess of Jane is simply $\\frac{3}{8} \\times$ the difference in total area of the pizzas.
