At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 25 members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer.  In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members can only hold at most one office?",

Finally, once the president and secretary are chosen, there are 23 members left to choose from for treasurer.\nThe number of ways to choose the officers is $25 \\times 24 \\times 23$.\n$25 \\times 24 = 600$\n$600 \\times 23 = 13800$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13800}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
