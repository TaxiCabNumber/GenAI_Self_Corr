        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?",
        "inference": "To find the number of boxes Tamantha needs, divide the total number of discs by the capacity of each box: 77 discs / 12 discs/box = 6 with a remainder of 5.  Since she can't buy a fraction of a box, she needs to buy 7 boxes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose Tamantha buys $n$ boxes. Since $n$ boxes will hold $12n$ discs, Tamantha will only be able to store all her discs if $12n \\ge 77$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $12$ gives $n\\ge \\frac{77}{12}$, which we can write as $n\\ge 6\\frac{5}{12}$. Tamantha can only buy a whole number of boxes, so the smallest number that will work is $\\boxed{7}$."
