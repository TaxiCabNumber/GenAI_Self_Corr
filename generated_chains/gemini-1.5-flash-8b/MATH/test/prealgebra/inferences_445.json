At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix horses eat 12 bales of hay in 12 hours. At the same rate, how many hours will 36 bales of hay last 12 horses?",
        "inference": "Six horses eat 12 bales of hay in 12 hours.\nThis means that 1 horse eats 12 bales / 6 horses = 2 bales in 12 hours.\nTherefore, 1 horse eats 2 bales / 12 hours = 1/6 bales per hour.\n12 horses eat 12 horses * 1/6 bales/hour = 2 bales/hour.\nTo find the number of hours it takes for 12 horses to eat 36 bales of hay, we divide the number of bales by the rate at which they eat:\n36 bales / 2 bales/hour = 18 hours.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "From the original rate, we note that 12 horses will eat 12 bales of hay in 6 hours. (Double the number of horses, half the time)  Therefore, 12 horses will eat 36 bales of hay in $\\boxed{18\\text{ hours}}$. (Triple the amount of hay, triple the time)"
