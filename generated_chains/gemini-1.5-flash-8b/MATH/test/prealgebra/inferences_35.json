At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many whole numbers between 99 and 999 contain exactly one 0?",
        "inference": "1. The whole numbers are between 99 and 999, so they have 3 digits.\n2. The numbers must contain exactly one 0.\n3. The first digit can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.  If the first digit is 0, it's not a 3-digit number.\n4. If the first digit is 1-9 (9 possibilities), the second digit can be 0 or 1-9 (10 possibilities, but one of them is 0), so there are 9 possibilities.\n5. The third digit can be 0 or 1-9. If the third digit is 0, there is already a 0 in the number, which means it's not exactly one 0, so we have 9 possibilities for the third digit (except for the case where the middle digit is 0). This gives a total of 9 * 9 * 9 = 729 possibilities where the first digit is 1-9.\n6. If the second digit is 0, then the first digit can be 1-9 (9 possibilities), the third digit can be 1-9 (9 possibilities). This gives 9 * 1 * 9 = 81 possibilities.\n7. If the third digit is 0, then the first digit can be 1-9 (9 possibilities), the second digit can be 1-9 (9 possibilities). This gives 9 * 9 * 1 = 81 possibilities.\n8. The total number of possibilities is the sum of the possibilities where the first digit is 0, second digit is 0, and third digit is 0.\n9. The total number of possibilities is 81 + 81 = 162.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{162}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
