At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $x$ in the equation $3x + 2 + 3(1+x) = 23$?",
        "inference": "1. Distribute the 3 in the parenthesis: $3x + 2 + 3 + 3x = 23$\n2. Combine like terms: $6x + 5 = 23$\n3. Subtract 5 from both sides: $6x = 18$\n4. Divide both sides by 6: $x = 3$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Expanding and collecting like terms on the left hand side gives $6x+5=23$. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $6x=18$. Then, dividing both sides by 6 gives $x=\\boxed{3}$."
