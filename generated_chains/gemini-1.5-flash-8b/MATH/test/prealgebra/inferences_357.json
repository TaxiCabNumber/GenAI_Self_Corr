At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo interior angles of a convex pentagon are right angles and the other three interior angles are congruent. In degrees, what is the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.\nTwo angles are 90 degrees each, so the sum of these two angles is 180 degrees.\nThe remaining three angles are congruent, so let each of these angles be x.\nThen, the sum of the five angles is 180 + 3x = 540.\n3x = 540 - 180\n3x = 360\nx = 360 / 3\nx = 120\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$. The pentagon has 5 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is $180\\cdot3$. We subtract the degree measures of the two right angles to get $180\\cdot3-90-90=180\\cdot2$, which is the sum of the measures of the three congruent interior angles. We divide by 3 to get the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles: $\\frac{180\\cdot2}{3}=60\\cdot2=\\boxed{120^\\circ}$."
