At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has a hypotenuse of length 5 units and a leg of length 3 units. How many square units is the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "1. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the other leg.  Let the other leg be 'x'.  \n   3\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n   9 + x\u00b2 = 25\n   x\u00b2 = 16\n   x = 4\n\n2. The area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  In this case, the base and height are the two legs of the triangle.\n   Area = (1/2) * 3 * 4\n\n3. Area = 6\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The other leg has length $\\sqrt{5^2-3^2}=4$.  So the area is\n\n$$\\frac{3(4)}{2}=\\boxed{6}$$"
