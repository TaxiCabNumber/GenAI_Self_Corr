        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.\n\n2. Calculate the rate of temperature increase per minute: 1.5 degrees / 15 minutes = 0.1 degrees/minute.\n\n3. Calculate the total temperature increase in 120 minutes: 0.1 degrees/minute * 120 minutes = 12 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees."
