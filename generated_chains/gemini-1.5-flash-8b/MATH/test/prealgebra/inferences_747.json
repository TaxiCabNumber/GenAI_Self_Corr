        "inference": "The problem states the length is $x+2$ and the width is $x-2$. The perimeter is 56.\nUsing the perimeter formula, $P = 2(l+w)$, we have $56 = 2((x+2)+(x-2))$.\nSimplifying, $56 = 2(2x)$, so $56 = 4x$.  Solving for $x$, we get $x=14$.\nThe length is $x+2 = 14+2 = 16$, and the width is $x-2 = 14-2 = 12$.\nThe area is length times width, so $A = 16 \\times 12 = 192$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{192}$",
