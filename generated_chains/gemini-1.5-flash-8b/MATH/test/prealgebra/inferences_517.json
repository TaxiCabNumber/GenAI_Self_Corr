        "ground_truth": "If we let $s$ be the side length of one square, we have that one side length makes up the height of the rectangle and three side lengths makes up the length of the rectangle. Then, in terms of $s$, the rectangle has a perimeter of $s+3s+s+3s=8s$. We know that the perimeter of the rectangle is $104$ inches, so we have that $8s=104$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$, we have that $s=13$. One square must have an area of $s^2=13^2=\\boxed{169}$ square inches."

        "inference": "The rectangle is formed by placing three identical squares side by side.  The length of the rectangle is 3s, and the width is s.  The perimeter of the rectangle is given by 2(length + width) = 2(3s + s) = 2(4s) = 8s.  We are given that the perimeter is 104 inches, so 8s = 104.  Solving for s, we get s = 104/8 = 13.
