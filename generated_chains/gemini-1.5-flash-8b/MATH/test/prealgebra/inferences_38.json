        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen you sketch a figure of an adult male, it is recommended that the head be $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the total height. If the full drawn height of a 6-foot man is 16 inches, how many inches should the drawing of his head be from top to bottom?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the man's height from feet to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.\n\n2. Calculate the head height in inches: 72 inches * (1/8) = 9 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "It doesn't matter how tall the man actually is. We are told that the head should be $1/8$ of the total height, so $(1/8)(16) = \\boxed{2}$."
