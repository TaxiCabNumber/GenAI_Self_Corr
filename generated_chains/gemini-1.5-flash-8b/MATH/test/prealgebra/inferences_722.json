        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 19 miles north, then 16 miles west, then 3 miles south and finally 4 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
        "inference": "1. Northward movement: 19 miles\n2. Westward movement: 16 miles\n3. Southward movement: 3 miles\n4. Eastward movement: 4 miles\n\nNet northward movement = 19 - 3 = 16 miles\nNet eastward movement = 4 miles\nNet westward movement = 16 miles\n\nThe traveler is 16 miles north and 12 miles west from the starting point.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the starting point is \u221a(16\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(256 + 144) = \u221a400 = 20 miles.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$ miles. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In total, the traveler went 16 miles north and 12 miles west. This forms a 12-16-20 (3-4-5) Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{20}$ miles away from the starting point."
