At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob placed three regular pentagons together at a vertex, thinking he might be able to form a tessellation. However, they left a gap. What is the number of degrees in the measure indicated?

        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula (n-2) * 180, where n is the number of sides. For a pentagon, n = 5, so the sum of interior angles is (5-2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.  Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is 540 / 5 = 108 degrees.\n\nSince three pentagons meet at a vertex, the total angle around the vertex is 360 degrees.\nThe angles of the three pentagons at the vertex are 108 degrees each.  The total angle covered by the three pentagons is 3 * 108 = 324 degrees.\nThe gap is the difference between 360 and 324 degrees.\n360 - 324 = 36 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The angles of a pentagon sum to $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so each angle of a regular pentagon is $540^\\circ/5 = 108^\\circ$.  Therefore, three of these angles sum to $3\\cdot 108^\\circ = 324^\\circ$, which means the indicated angle measures $360^\\circ - 324^\\circ = \\boxed{36^\\circ}$."
