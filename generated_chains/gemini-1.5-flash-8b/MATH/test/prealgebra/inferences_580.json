        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $\\sqrt{(\\sqrt{56})(\\sqrt{126})}$ can be simplified to $a\\sqrt b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b$ is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. What is $a+b$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since 56 is a multiple of 4 and 126 is a multiple of 9, we can factor squares out of both terms, getting $\\sqrt{(2\\sqrt{14})(3\\sqrt{14})}=\\sqrt{2\\cdot3\\cdot14}$. Then, we can factor $2^2$ out of the outer square root to get $2\\sqrt{21}$. Thus $a=2$ and $b=21$, yielding $a+b=\\boxed{23}$."
