The nine-sided figure is composed of the three remaining sides of the squares on the sides of the triangle. Each remaining side of a square has length equal to the side of the triangle.  The sum of the lengths of the three sides of each square is $a+b+c$.  However, this figure has three additional segments.  The total length of the remaining sides of the squares is $a+b+c = 17$.   Each of the sides of the squares is equal in length to the side of the triangle on which it is constructed. The perimeter of the figure formed by the three sides of the squares is $3a + 3b + 3c$. But this would be counting each side of the triangle three times.  However, we only want the three remaining sides.
