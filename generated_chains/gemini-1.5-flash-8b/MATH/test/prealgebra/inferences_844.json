At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA watered circular field (shaded) is inscribed in a square plot of land. The square plot has sides of length 500 meters. What is the area of the land that is not watered? Express your answer to the nearest thousand square meters.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(10,10)--(0,10)--cycle,linewidth(1));\nfill(Circle((5,5),5),gray(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5),linewidth(1));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "1. The square plot has sides of length 500 meters.  The area of the square plot is 500 * 500 = 250,000 square meters.\n\n2. The circular field is inscribed in the square.  This means the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.  So the diameter of the circle is 500 meters.\n\n3. The radius of the circle is half the diameter, which is 500/2 = 250 meters.\n\n4. The area of the circular field is \u03c0 * radius^2 = \u03c0 * 250^2 = 62500\u03c0 square meters.\n\n5. The area of the land that is not watered is the area of the square minus the area of the circle: 250000 - 62500\u03c0.\n\n6. Using the approximation \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159, we calculate 62500 * 3.14159 \u2248 196349.54 square meters.\n\n7. Subtracting this from the area of the square: 250000 - 196349.54 \u2248 53650.46 square meters.\n\n8. Rounding to the nearest thousand square meters, the area of the land that is not watered is approximately 54000 square meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54000}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area that is not watered is the area inside the square but outside the circle. The area of the square is $500\\cdot500=250000$ square meters. To find the area of the circle, we note that the diameter of the circle is equal to a side of the square, so the radius is $500/2=250$ meters. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi 250^2\\approx196300$ square meters. Thus, the unwatered region has area $250000-196300\\approx\\boxed{54000}$ square meters."
