        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA housefly sits on the outer edge of a rotating circular ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet. The fan rotates constantly at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. How many minutes had the housefly been on the fan during the time it took to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "1. The diameter of the fan is 6 feet, so the radius is 3 feet.\n2. The circumference of the circular path of the housefly is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi(3) = 6\\pi$ feet.\n3. The fan rotates at 20 revolutions per minute, so the distance traveled in one minute is $20 \\times 6\\pi = 120\\pi$ feet.\n4. To travel $19,404\\pi$ feet, the time taken is $\\frac{19404\\pi}{120\\pi} = \\frac{19404}{120} = 161.7$ minutes.\n5. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the time is 162 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{162}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "A ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet has a circumference of $6\\pi$ feet. If the fly traveled $19{,}404\\pi$ feet, then it must have made $19{,}404\\pi \\div 6\\pi = 3234$ revolutions. Since the fan rotates 20 times per minute, that's $3234 \\div 20 = 161.7$ minutes, or about $\\boxed{162\\text{ minutes}}$, to the nearest whole number."
