        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou begin with $\\frac{1}{2}$ scoop of ice cream.  Since you're hungry, you ask the vendor for $\\frac{2}{7}$ more scoops of ice cream.  Then, you eat $\\frac{5}{8}$ scoops.  How many scoops of ice cream are left on your cone?",
        "inference": "1. Start with $\\frac{1}{2}$ scoop.\n2. Add $\\frac{2}{7}$ scoops: $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{7}{14} + \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{11}{14}$ scoops.\n3. Eat $\\frac{5}{8}$ scoops: $\\frac{11}{14} - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{44}{56} - \\frac{35}{56} = \\frac{9}{56}$ scoops.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{56}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We want to find $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{5}{8}$.  The common denominator is 56, so we try to rewrite each of the three fractions with 56 on the bottom.\n\n$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{28}{28} = \\frac{28}{56}$. Also, $\\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{2}{7} \\cdot \\frac{8}{8} = \\frac{16}{56}$. Finally, $\\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{7}{7} = \\frac{35}{56}$.\n\nThus, we have $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{7} - \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{28}{56} + \\frac{16}{56} - \\frac{35}{56} = \\frac{28+16-35}{56} = \\frac{44-35}{56} = \\frac{9}{56}$.  Because 9 and 56 have no common divisors, this is the simplest form, and our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{56}}$."
