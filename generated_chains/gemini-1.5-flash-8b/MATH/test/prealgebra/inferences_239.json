At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAditi can walk 1.7 miles in half an hour. At the same constant speed, how many hours would it take her to walk 17 miles?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate Aditi's speed: 1.7 miles / 0.5 hours = 3.4 miles/hour\n\n2. Calculate the time needed to walk 17 miles: 17 miles / 3.4 miles/hour = 5 hours\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ hours. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "17 miles is 10 times as far as 1.7, meaning that it takes Aditi 10 half hours to walk 17 miles, which is $\\boxed{5}$ hours."
