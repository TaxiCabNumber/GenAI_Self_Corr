        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the $19^\\text{th}$ century, Britain used a money system which included pence, farthings, shillings and pounds. The following conversions were used:\n\n$\\bullet$ $4 \\text{ farthings} = 1 \\text{ pence},$\n\n$\\bullet$ $12 \\text{ pence} = 1 \\text{ shilling},$\n\n$\\bullet$ $20 \\text{ shillings} = 1 \\text{ pound}.$\n\nHow many total farthings were equivalent to $1$ pound and $5$ pence?",
        "inference": "1 pound = 20 shillings\n1 shilling = 12 pence\n1 pence = 4 farthings\n\n1 pound = 20 * 12 pence = 240 pence\n1 pound = 240 * 4 farthings = 960 farthings\n\n5 pence = 5 * 4 farthings = 20 farthings\n\n1 pound and 5 pence = 960 farthings + 20 farthings = 980 farthings\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{980}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Convert $1$ pound to farthings: \\[\n1\\mbox{ pound} \\times \\frac{20\\mbox{ shillings}}{1\\mbox{ pound}} \\times \\frac{12\\mbox{ pence}}{1\\mbox{ shilling}} \\times \\frac{4\\mbox{ farthings}}{1\\mbox{ pence}}\n= 960\\mbox{ farthings}.\n\\] The remaining $5$ pence is equal to $20$ farthings, so the total is $\\boxed{980}$ farthings."
