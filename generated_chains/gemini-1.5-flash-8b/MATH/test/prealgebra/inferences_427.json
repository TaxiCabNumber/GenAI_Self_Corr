At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular garden shares one side with one side of a house. An adjacent side of the garden is eight feet long. If the area of the garden is 184 square feet, what is the length, in feet, of the common side?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the common side be $x$ feet.\nThe adjacent side of the garden is 8 feet long.\nThe area of the garden is given as 184 square feet.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.\nIn this case, the area is $x \\times 8 = 184$.\n$8x = 184$\n$x = \\frac{184}{8}$\n$x = 23$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{23}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the garden is the product of the sides.  So the common side must be\n\n$$\\frac{184}{8}=\\boxed{23}$$\n\nfeet."
