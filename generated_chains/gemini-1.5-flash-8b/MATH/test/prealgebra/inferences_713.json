At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo ropes, 18 meters in length and 24 meters in length, need to be cut into pieces which are all the same length. What is the greatest possible length of each piece?",
        "inference": "To find the greatest possible length of each piece, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24.\nThe factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\nThe factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\nThe greatest common factor is 6.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the two ropes are cut into pieces of length $x$, then both $18$ and $24$ must be divisible by $x$. Therefore, we are looking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $18$ and $24$. We know that $18=2\\cdot 3^2$ and $24=2^3 \\cdot 3$, so their GCD is $2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$."
