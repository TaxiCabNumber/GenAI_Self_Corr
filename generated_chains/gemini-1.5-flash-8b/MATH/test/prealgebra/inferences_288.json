I hope it is correct.'\nKelly drove north for 9 miles and then east for 12 miles at an average rate of 42 miles per hour to arrive at the town of Prime. Brenda left from the same location, at the same time, and drove along a straight road to Prime at an average rate of 45 miles per hour. How many minutes earlier than Kelly did Brenda arrive?",
        "inference": "1. Find the distance Brenda traveled using the Pythagorean theorem.  The distance is \u221a(9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(81 + 144) = \u221a225 = 15 miles.\n\n2. Calculate Kelly's travel time.  Time = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 42 mph = 15/42 hours.\n\n3. Calculate Brenda's travel time.  Time = Distance / Speed = 15 miles / 45 mph = 1/3 hours.\n\n4. Calculate the difference in travel times in hours.  15/42 hours - 1/3 hours = 5/14 hours.\n\n5. Convert the difference in time to minutes.  (5/14 hours) * (60 minutes/hour) = 300/14 minutes = 150/7 minutes \u2248 21.43 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$ minutes. I hope it is correct.\n",

Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.  Brenda drove for 15 miles at an average rate of 45 miles per hour, so she drove for $15/45\\cdot 60=20$ minutes.  Thus, Brenda arrived $30-20=\\boxed{10}$ minutes earlier than Kelly."

        "inference": "The provided solution correctly calculates the difference in travel times but misinterprets the context.
