At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKelly can read five pages of her fiction book or two pages of her history textbook in seven minutes. If Kelly wants to read thirty pages of each book, for how many minutes in total must Kelly read?",
        "inference": "Fiction book pages per 7 minutes = 5 pages\nHistory book pages per 7 minutes = 2 pages\nTotal pages to read = 30 (fiction) + 30 (history) = 60 pages\n\nFiction book time:\n30 pages / 5 pages/7 minutes = 6 * 7 minutes = 42 minutes\n\nHistory book time:\n30 pages / 2 pages/7 minutes = 15 * 7 minutes = 105 minutes\n\nTotal time = 42 minutes + 105 minutes = 147 minutes\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{147}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Thirty pages of a fiction book is six sets of five pages, so it will take $6\\times 7 = 42$ minutes to read the fiction book. Likewise, thirty pages of a history textbook is fifteen sets of two pages, so it will take $15\\times 7 = 105$ minutes to read the history textbook. In total, this will be $42+105 = \\boxed{147}$ minutes."
