At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nVictor and Kelsey have identical sandwiches. Victor eats $\\frac{2}{5}$ of his sandwich. If Kelsey eats $\\frac{15}{8}$ as much as Victor does, what fraction of her sandwich did she eat?",

Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\\frac{3 \\cdot \\cancel{5} \\cdot \\cancel{2}}{\\cancel{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cancel{5}} = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot 2}$.
