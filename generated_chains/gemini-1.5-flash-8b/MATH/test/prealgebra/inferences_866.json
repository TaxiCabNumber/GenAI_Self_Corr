At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn 1992, a scoop of gelato could be purchased in Italy for 1200 lire. The same gelato would have cost $\\$1.50$ in the U.S. At the equivalent exchange rate between the lire and the dollar, how many dollars would be equivalent to 1,000,000 lire?",
        "inference": "1. Set up a proportion:  (1200 lire / $1.50) = (1,000,000 lire / x dollars)\n\n2. Solve for x:\n   x = (1,000,000 lire * $1.50) / 1200 lire\n\n3. Calculate:\n   x = $1250\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$1250}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Multiply both sides of $1200\\text{ lire}=\\$1.50$ by $1,\\!000,\\!000/1200$ to find that one million lire equals $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot10,\\!000/12=\\boxed{1250}$ dollars."
