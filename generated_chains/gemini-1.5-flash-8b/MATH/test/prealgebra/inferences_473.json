Then $x = -5$ and $y = 20$. $4x = 4(-5) = -20$ and $2y - 60 = 2(20) - 60 = 40 - 60 = -20$, so this is correct.\n\nIf the condition is \"four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number\" and $x < y$, then $4x = 2y - 60$.\nIf the sum is $x+y = 15$, then $y = 15-x$.\n$4x = 2(15-x) - 60$\n$4x = 30 - 2x - 60$\n$4x = -30 - 2x$\n$6x = -30$\n$x = -5$\nand $y = 15 - (-5) = 20$\nThe numbers are -5 and 20.
