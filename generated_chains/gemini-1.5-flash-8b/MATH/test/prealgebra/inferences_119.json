At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA trapezoid has one base equal to its height, $x$, and the other base is twice as long. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of $x$.",
        "inference": "Let the height of the trapezoid be $x$.\nOne base is equal to the height, so let the first base be $b_1 = x$.\nThe other base is twice as long, so let the second base be $b_2 = 2x$.\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we have:\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)x$\n$A = \\frac{1}{2}(3x)x$\n$A = \\frac{3x^2}{2}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3x^2}{2}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the length of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $x$ and $2x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{x+2x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{3x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\frac{3x^2}{2}}$."
