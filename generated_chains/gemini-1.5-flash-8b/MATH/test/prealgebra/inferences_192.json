        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree schools have a chess tournament. Four players come from each school. Each player plays three games against each player from the other schools, and plays one game against each other player from his or her own school. How many games of chess are played?",
        "inference": "1. Players from each school: 4\n2. Total players: 3 schools * 4 players/school = 12 players\n3. Games played between players from different schools:\n   - Each player from one school plays 3 games against each player from each of the other two schools.\n   - So, 4 players from one school play 3 games each against 4 players from another school.  This gives 4 * 3 = 12 games between players from two schools.\n   - Since there are 3 schools, there are 3 pairs of schools.\n   - Total games between different schools: 12 games/pair * 3 pairs = 36 games\n4. Games played within each school:\n   - Each player plays 1 game against each other player from their own school.\n   - Within one school, there are 4 players.  Each player plays 3 games against other players from that school.  The number of games is 4 players * (4 - 1)/2 = 4*3/2= 6 games.\n   - Since there are 3 schools, the total number of games within a school is 6 games/school * 3 schools = 18 games.\n5. Total games:\n   - Games between different schools + games within schools = 36 games + 18 games = 54 games\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each player plays $3\\cdot 8 + 3=27$ games of chess, and there are 12 players. If we multiplied 27 by 12 we would count each game twice, so we must divide this number by 2. The total number of games played is $(27 \\cdot 12)/2=\\boxed{162}$."
