At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn meant to divide a number by $2$, but he was careless and subtracted $2$ from the number instead.  He got an answer of $22$.  What would his answer have been had he actually divided by $2$ instead of subtracting $2$?",
        "inference": "John subtracted 2 from the number and got 22.  This means the number is 22 + 2 = 24.\n\nIf he had divided 24 by 2, his answer would have been 24 / 2 = 12.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number John was supposed to divide by 2 be $x$. We have the equation $x-2=22$, from which we find that $x=24$. Had John divided by 2, he would have gotten $x/2=24/2=12$. Thus, the answer John should have gotten is $\\boxed{12}$."
