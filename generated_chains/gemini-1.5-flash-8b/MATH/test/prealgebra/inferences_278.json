At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSallie earned a grade of exactly $90 \\%$ for a marking period based on six equally weighed tests. The four test papers she can find have grades of exactly $83 \\%$, $96 \\%$, $81 \\%$, and $82\\%$. What is the sum of the percent scores of the two missing grades?",
