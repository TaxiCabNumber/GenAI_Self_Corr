At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy club has 15 members.  In how many ways can we choose a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, if either the secretary or the treasurer must be elected vice-president and no other member can hold more than one office?",
