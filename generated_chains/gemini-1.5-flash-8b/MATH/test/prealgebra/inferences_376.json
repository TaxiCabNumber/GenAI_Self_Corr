        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKelly's art teacher asked him to draw a rectangle with a length of $6$ inches and a width of $10$ inches.  After Kelly does so, his teacher changes her mind and asks him to draw a proportional rectangle that has a length of $9$ inches.  How many inches wide is the new rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the original rectangle have length $l_1 = 6$ inches and width $w_1 = 10$ inches.\nLet the new rectangle have length $l_2 = 9$ inches and width $w_2$.\nSince the rectangles are proportional, the ratio of the length to the width must be the same for both rectangles.\nThus, $\\frac{l_1}{w_1} = \\frac{l_2}{w_2}$.\nSubstituting the given values, we have\n$\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{9}{w_2}$.\nCross-multiplying, we get $6w_2 = 10 \\times 9 = 90$.\nDividing both sides by $6$, we find $w_2 = \\frac{90}{6} = 15$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the two rectangles are proportional, the ratio of the lengths will be equal to the ratio of the widths.  The ratio of length of the new rectangle to the length of the old rectangle is $\\frac{9}{6}$ and thus the desired width is $10 \\times \\frac {9}{6}=\\boxed{15}$ inches."
