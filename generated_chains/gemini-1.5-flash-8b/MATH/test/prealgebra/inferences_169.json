        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLouis and Jack are sharing a pie.  Louis eats $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the pie, and Jack eats $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the pie.  How much of the pie do Louis and Jack eat altogether?",
        "inference": "Louis eats $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the pie.\nJack eats $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the pie.\nTo find the total amount of pie they eat together, we add the fractions:\n$\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15.\n$\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{3}{15}$\n$\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5} = \\frac{10}{15}$\n\nNow add the fractions:\n$\\frac{3}{15} + \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{3+10}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The denominators $5$ and $3$ have a common multiple of $15$.  We use this to write $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot \\frac{3}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot \\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{10}{15}$.  Then, we can add the fractions by adding the numerators and keeping the denominator.  We have $$\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{3}{15}+\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{3+10}{15}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}.$$"
