        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer $n$ such that $5n + 3 > -10$?",
        "inference": "1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the inequality: $5n + 3 - 3 > -10 - 3$\n2. Simplify: $5n > -13$\n3. Divide both sides by 5: $\\frac{5n}{5} > \\frac{-13}{5}$\n4. Simplify: $n > -13/5 = -2.6$\n5. The smallest integer greater than -2.6 is -2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $3$ from both sides of the inequality gives $5n>-13$, and dividing both sides by $5$ gives $n>-\\frac{13}{5}$. Since $-\\frac{13}{5}$ is between $-\\frac{15}{5}=-3$ and $-\\frac{10}{5}=-2$, the smallest integer $n$ satisfying our inequality is $\\boxed{-2}$."
