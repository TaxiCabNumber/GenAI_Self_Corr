        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJim and Martha are standing together at the corner of a rectangular field. Jim walks diagonally across the field. Martha gets to the same location by walking along its length and width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. How many feet less than Martha does Jim walk?",
        "inference": "1. **Jim's distance:**  Jim walks diagonally across the field.  The diagonal distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 300 feet (width) and 400 feet (length). Using the Pythagorean theorem:  diagonal^2 = 300^2 + 400^2 = 90000 + 160000 = 250000.  Taking the square root, Jim's distance = \u221a250000 = 500 feet.\n\n2. **Martha's distance:** Martha walks the length and width.  Martha's distance = 300 feet + 400 feet = 700 feet.\n\n3. **Difference:** Jim walks 700 feet - 500 feet = 200 feet less than Martha.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonal of the field is $\\sqrt{300^2+400^2}=500$ feet long so Jim walks 500 feet. Two adjacent sides of the field are $300+400=700$ feet long so Martha walks 700 feet. Jim walks $700-500=\\boxed{200}$ feet less than Martha."
