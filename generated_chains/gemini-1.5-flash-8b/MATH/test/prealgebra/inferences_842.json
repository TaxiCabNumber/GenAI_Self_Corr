        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?",
        "inference": "1 kilometer = 1000 meters.\nThe robot's speed is 1000 meters / (2.5 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) = 1000/9000 meters/second = 1/9 meters/second.\nThe length of the hallway is (1/9 meters/second) * (90 seconds) = 10 meters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We see that 2.5 hours is the same as $2.5\\cdot 60 = 150$ minutes, or $150\\cdot 60 = 9000$ seconds.  This is 100 times longer than the robot was traveling the hallway, meaning the hallway is $\\frac{1}{100}$ kilometers, or $\\frac{1000}{100} = \\boxed{10}$ meters long."
