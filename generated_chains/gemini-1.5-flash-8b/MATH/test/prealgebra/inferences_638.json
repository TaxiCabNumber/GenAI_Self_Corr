At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTrae is searching for a treasure on the beach. From point $A$, he is told to walk two meters north, three meters east, and then two meters north to point $B$. In meters, what is the length of $\\overline{AB}$?",
        "inference": "1. Trae walks 2 meters north from A.\n2. Then he walks 3 meters east.\n3. Finally, he walks 2 meters north to reach point B.\n\nTo find the distance between A and B, we can think of this as the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\nThe horizontal distance between A and B is 3 meters east.\nThe vertical distance between A and B is 2 meters north + 2 meters north = 4 meters north.\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB.\n$AB^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$\n$AB = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In total, Trae walked 4 meters north and 3 meters east to get from point $A$ to point $B$. Since 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triple, the length of $\\overline{AB} = \\boxed{5}$."
