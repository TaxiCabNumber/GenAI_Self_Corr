At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDave's sister baked $3$ dozen pies of which a third contained chocolate, a quarter contained marshmallows, a sixth contained cayenne, and one twelfth contained salted soy nuts.  What is the smallest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients?",
        "inference": "1. Chocolate pies: (1/3) * 36 = 12 pies\n2. Marshmallow pies: (1/4) * 36 = 9 pies\n3. Cayenne pies: (1/6) * 36 = 6 pies\n4. Salted soy nut pies: (1/12) * 36 = 3 pies\n5. Total pies with ingredients: 12 + 9 + 6 + 3 = 30 pies\n6. Pies with no ingredients: 36 - 30 = 6 pies\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",

If she does this, then  \\[12+9+6+3=30\\] of the pies will have one of these ingredients.  The other 6 pies will have none of these ingredients.  At least $\\boxed{6}$ pies have none of these ingredients."
