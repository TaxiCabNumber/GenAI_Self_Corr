To make this pie chart of this result, what is the lesser measure in degrees of angle $ACB$?\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,20));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,-16));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,20),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(12,-16),SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"YES\",(10,13),S);\nlabel(\"NO\",(-10,13),S);\nlabel(\"36\",(-10,10),S);\nlabel(\"24\",(10,10),S);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The total number of votes is 36 (No) + 24 (Yes) = 60.\nThe proportion of No votes is 36/60 = 3/5.\nThe proportion of Yes votes is 24/60 = 2/5.\nThe measure of angle $ACB$ representing No votes is (3/5) * 360 degrees = 216 degrees.\nThe measure of angle $ACB$ representing Yes votes is (2/5) * 360 degrees = 144 degrees.\nThe lesser measure in degrees of angle $ACB$ is 144 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{144}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the number Yes's to the number of votes is $24/(24+36)=2/5$.  Therefore, angle $ACB$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of 360 degrees, which is $\\boxed{144}$ degrees."
