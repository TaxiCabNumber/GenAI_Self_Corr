At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCheldelin Middle School has 12 doors to enter or leave the building. In how many ways is it possible to enter the building by one door and leave the building by a different door?",
        "inference": "There are 12 doors to enter the building.\nThere are 12 choices for the entering door.\nAfter entering the building, there are 11 remaining doors to leave by.\nThe number of ways to enter and leave by different doors is $12 \\times 11 = 132$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{132}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "You can enter the building through one of 12 different doors. Since only that door is eliminated from the doors for you to exit, there are 11 choices for the exit door. So the total number of ordered pairs of enter, exit doors is $12 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{132}$."
