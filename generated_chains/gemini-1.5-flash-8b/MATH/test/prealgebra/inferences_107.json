At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "An equilateral triangle has 3 equal interior angles. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.  Therefore, each interior angle of an equilateral triangle is 180/3 = 60 degrees.\n\nA square has 4 equal interior angles. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  Therefore, each interior angle of a square is 360/4 = 90 degrees.\n\nThe ratio of the interior angle of an equilateral triangle to the interior angle of a square is 60/90 = 2/3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "One interior angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees while one interior angle of a square measures 90 degrees. The ratio is $60/90=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
