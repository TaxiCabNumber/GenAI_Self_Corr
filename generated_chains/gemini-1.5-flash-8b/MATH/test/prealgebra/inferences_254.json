        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat number must be placed in the box in the equation below to produce an equation that has more than one solution: \\[4x + 6 + 7x - 9 = 12x - 7 - x + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}?\\]",
        "inference": "1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n   4x + 7x + 6 - 9 = 11x - 3\n\n2.

Subtract 11x from both sides:\n   -3 = -7 + box\n\n5. Add 7 to both sides:\n   4 = box\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Simplifying both sides gives \\[11x - 3 = 11x - 7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] Subtracting $11x$ from both sides gives \\[-3 = -7 + \\boxed{\\phantom{2}}.\\] If the number in the box is anything but 4, then the equation cannot be true, and the original equation has no solutions.  If the number in the box is $\\boxed{4}$, then the two sides of the original equation are equivalent, and all values of $x$ are solutions to the equation."
