        "inference": "The minute hand is at the $12$ mark.\nThe hour hand is at $2$.\nThe angle between the $12$ and the $2$ is $2 \\times 30^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$.\nThe minute hand is at the $48$ minute mark, which is $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac{4}{5}$ of the way from the $12$ to the $1$.\nThe minute hand is at $\\frac{4}{5} \\times 30^{\\circ} = 24^{\\circ}$ from the $12$ mark.\nThe minute hand is at the $12$ mark, which is $0^{\\circ}$.\nThe hour hand moves $360^{\\circ}$ in $12$ hours, which means it moves $30^{\\circ}$ per hour.\nAt $2$ o'clock, the hour hand is at $2 \\times 30^{\\circ} = 60^{\\circ}$.\nAt $2:48$, the minute hand is at $\\frac{48}{60} \\times 30 = 24^{\\circ}$ from the $12$ mark.\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand at $2:48$ is $60^{\\circ} + 24^{\\circ} = 84^{\\circ}$.\nThe smaller angle is $360^{\\circ} - 84^{\\circ} = 276^{\\circ}$.\nHowever, the smaller angle is $60^{\\circ} - 24^{\\circ} = 36^{\\circ}$.\nThe hour hand is at $2$ and the minute hand is at $48$ minutes.\nThe hour hand is at $2 \\times 30 = 60^{\\circ}$.\nThe minute hand is at $\\frac{48}{60} \\times 360 = 48 \\times 6 = 288^{\\circ}$.\nThe minute hand is at $48 \\times 6 = 288^{\\circ}$.\nThe angle from the 12 to 2 is $2 \\times 30 = 60^{\\circ}$.\nThe minute hand is at $48 \\times \\frac{30}{60} = 48 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 24^{\\circ}$.\nThe smaller angle between the hour and minute hands is $|60 - 24| = 36^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$",
        "ground_truth": "We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=6^\\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\\cdot6^\\circ=288^\\circ$.\n\nThe hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\\circ-288^\\circ=\\boxed{156^\\circ}$ to find the smaller angle."
