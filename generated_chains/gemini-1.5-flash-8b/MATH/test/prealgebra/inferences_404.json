At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $x$ is tripled and then increased by $7$, the result is $-8$. What is the value of $x$?",

The result is $-8$, so we have the equation $3x + 7 = -8$.\n5. Subtracting $7$ from both sides gives $3x = -8 - 7 = -15$.\n6.
