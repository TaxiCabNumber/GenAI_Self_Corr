        "ground_truth": "Alula has already taken 7 quizzes, so after taking three more quizzes she will have 10 scores.  For these scores to have an average of 14, they must have a sum of $14\\times10=140$.  The sum of 17, 10, 9, 14, 16, 8, and 10 is 84, so the three remaining scores must sum to $140-84=\\boxed{56}$."
