        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$?",
        "inference": "1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the inequality: $13x + 8 - 8 < 35 - 8$, which simplifies to $13x < 27$.\n2. Divide both sides by 13: $x < \\frac{27}{13}$.\n3. Calculate the fraction: $\\frac{27}{13} \\approx 2.0769$.\n4. The largest integer less than 2.0769 is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $8$ from both sides of the inequality, we have $$13x < 27.$$ Dividing both sides by $13$ gives $$x < \\frac{27}{13}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$x < 2\\frac1{13}.$$ The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{2}$."
