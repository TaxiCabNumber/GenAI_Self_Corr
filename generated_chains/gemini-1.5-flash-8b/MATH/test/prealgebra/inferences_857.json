At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the NBA in 2003, Yao Ming was one of the tallest players at $7'5''$. Earl Boykins was the shortest player at $5'5''$. How many inches taller than Boykins was Ming?",
        "inference": "Yao Ming's height is 7 feet 5 inches.\nEarl Boykins' height is 5 feet 5 inches.\n\nFirst, convert both heights to inches.\n1 foot = 12 inches.\nYao Ming's height in inches = (7 * 12) + 5 = 84 + 5 = 89 inches\nEarl Boykins' height in inches = (5 * 12) + 5 = 60 + 5 = 65 inches\n\nNow, find the difference in their heights.\nDifference = Yao Ming's height - Earl Boykins' height\nDifference = 89 - 65 = 24 inches\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
