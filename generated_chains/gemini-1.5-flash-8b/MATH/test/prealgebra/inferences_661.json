At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle has a side of length 12 inches. What is the area of the triangle, in square inches? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "1. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is given by the formula: Area = (s\u00b2\u221a3)/4.\n2. In this case, the side length 's' is 12 inches.\n3. Substitute s = 12 into the formula: Area = (12\u00b2\u221a3)/4\n4. Calculate 12\u00b2 = 144\n5. Simplify the expression: Area = (144\u221a3)/4\n6. Simplify further: Area = 36\u221a3\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$. We have $s = 12$, so our area is $12^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = \\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$."
