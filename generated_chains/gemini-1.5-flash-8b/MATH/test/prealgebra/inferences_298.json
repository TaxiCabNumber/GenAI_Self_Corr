At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 2:30 p.m. during a long drive, Bobbi asks her parents, ``Are we there yet?'' Her mother responds, ``We will be there in 7200 seconds.'' If Bobbi's mother is correct, at what time in the afternoon will they arrive at their destination?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 7200 seconds to minutes: 7200 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 120 minutes.\n2. Convert 120 minutes to hours: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours.\n3. Add 2 hours to the current time of 2:30 p.m.: 2:30 p.m. + 2 hours = 4:30 p.m.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4:30}$ PM. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Multiply 7200 seconds by $\\left(\\frac{1\\text{ min.}}{60\\text{ sec.}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1\\text{ hr.}}{60\\text{ min.}}\\right)$ to find that they will arrive in 2 hours.  Two hours after 2:30 p.m. is $\\boxed{\\text{4:30 p.m.}}$."
