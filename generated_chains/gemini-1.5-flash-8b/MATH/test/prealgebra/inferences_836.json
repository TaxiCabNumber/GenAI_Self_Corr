At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have twenty balls numbered 1 through 20 in a bin.  In how many ways can I select 2 balls, if the order in which I draw them doesn't matter?",
        "inference": "We want to select 2 balls from 20 balls, where the order doesn't matter. This is a combination problem.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 balls from 20 balls is given by the combination formula:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nIn this case, $n = 20$ and $k = 2$.\n$$ \\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2!18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\times 19 = 190 $$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{190}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the order the balls are selected matters, there are 20 choices for the first selection and 19 choices for the second selection.  However, $20\\cdot 19$ counts each pair of balls twice, once for each possible order in which they can be selected.  So, we must divide by $2$, , to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\boxed{190}$."
