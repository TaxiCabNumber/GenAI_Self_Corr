At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery student in a homeroom class takes a biology course or a Spanish course or both. If 18 take biology, 13 take Spanish and 5 take both, how many students are in the homeroom classroom?",
        "inference": "Let B be the set of students taking biology, and S be the set of students taking Spanish.\nWe are given:\n|B| = 18 (number of students taking biology)\n|S| = 13 (number of students taking Spanish)\n|B \u2229 S| = 5 (number of students taking both biology and Spanish)\nWe want to find the total number of students in the homeroom, which is |B \u222a S|.\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n|B \u222a S| = |B| + |S| - |B \u2229 S|\n|B \u222a S| = 18 + 13 - 5\n|B \u222a S| = 31 - 5\n|B \u222a S| = 26\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $5$ students take both, then $18-5=13$ students take only biology and $13-5=8$ students take only Spanish. The total number of students is $5+13+8=\\boxed{26}$."
