        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ordinary $6$-sided die has a number on each face from $1$ to $6$ (each number appears on one face). How many ways can I paint two faces of a die blue, so that the product of the numbers on the painted faces isn't equal to $6$?",
        "inference": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$ ways to choose two faces to paint blue.\nThe pairs of numbers whose product is 6 are:\n(1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (6, 1).\nThus there are 4 pairs whose product is 6.\nThe number of ways to paint two faces blue such that the product of the numbers on the painted faces is 6 is 4.\nThe number of ways to paint two faces blue such that the product of the numbers on the painted faces is not 6 is $15 - 4 = 11$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, let's ignore the requirement that the product can't be $6$. Then I can pick the first blue face in $6$ ways, and the second blue face in $5$ ways, making $6\\cdot 5 = 30$ choices in all. But we've actually counted each possible result twice, because it makes no difference which of the two blue faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the number of different pairs of faces is really $(6\\cdot 5)/2$, or $15$.\n\nNow we exclude the pairs which have a product of $6$. There are two such pairs: $\\{1,6\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$. That leaves me $\\boxed{13}$ pairs of faces I can paint blue."
