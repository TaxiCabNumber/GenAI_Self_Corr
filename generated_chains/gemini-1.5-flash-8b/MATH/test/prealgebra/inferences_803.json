At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTim wants to create a circle graph showing the number of physicians whose specialty is aerospace medicine. He knows the following information.\n\n\n\n$\\bullet$ 53 male physicians are under 35 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 8 female physicians are under 35 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 155 male physicians are between 35 and 44 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 17 female physicians are between 35 and 44 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 145 male physicians are between 45 and 54 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 10 female physicians are between 45 and 54 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 98 male physicians are over 54 years of age.\n\n$\\bullet$ 2 female physicians are over 54 years of age.\n\n\n\nIf he wants to include each of the eight groups in his graph, how many degrees would he use for the central angle of the \"45-54 year-old Males\" sector? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
