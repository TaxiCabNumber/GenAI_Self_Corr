        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when the product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is divided by $42$?",
        "inference": "The five smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.\nTheir product is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 2310$.\nWe need to find the remainder when 2310 is divided by 42.\n$2310 \\div 42 = 55$ with a remainder of 0.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, while $42=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7$. Since the prime factorization of $42$ is included in the product $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, the former divides the latter perfectly, leaving remainder $\\boxed{0}$."
