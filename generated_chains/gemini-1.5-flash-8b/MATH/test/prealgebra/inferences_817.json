At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the median and the mean of the set of numbers 12, 21, 6, 11 and 30?",
        "inference": "1. Arrange the numbers in ascending order: 6, 11, 12, 21, 30.\n2. Find the median: The middle number is 12.\n3. Find the sum of the numbers: 6 + 11 + 12 + 21 + 30 = 80\n4. Find the number of numbers: 5\n5. Find the mean: 80 / 5 = 16\n6. Find the sum of the median and the mean: 12 + 16 = 28\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In order, the numbers are 6, 11, 12, 21, and 30, so the median is 12. The mean is $(6 + 11 + 12 + 21 + 30)/5 = 80/5 = 16$. The sum of these two numbers is $\\boxed{28}$."
