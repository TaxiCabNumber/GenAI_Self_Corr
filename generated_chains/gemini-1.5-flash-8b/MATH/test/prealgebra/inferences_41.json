At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary completes a 15-mile race in 2.5 hours. What is her average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "Average speed = total distance / total time\nAverage speed = 15 miles / 2.5 hours\nAverage speed = 6 miles/hour\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is total distance divided by time.  In this case, we divide 15 miles by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ hours to find an average speed of $15\\div \\frac{5}{2}=15\\cdot \\frac{2}{5}=\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour."
