I hope it is correct.'\nBefore taking his last test in a class, the arithmetic mean of Brian's  test scores is 91. He has determined that if he scores 98 on his last test, the arithmetic mean of all his test scores will be exactly 92. How many tests, including the last test, does Brian take for this class?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of tests Brian took before the last test.\nLet $S$ be the sum of the scores on the first $n$ tests.\nThe arithmetic mean of the first $n$ tests is 91.\nSo, $\\frac{S}{n} = 91$.\nThis gives us $S = 91n$.\nIf Brian scores 98 on the last test, the sum of all scores is $S + 98$.\nThe total number of tests is $n+1$.\nThe arithmetic mean of all his test scores is 92.\nSo, $\\frac{S+98}{n+1} = 92$.\nSubstituting $S = 91n$, we have\n$\\frac{91n+98}{n+1} = 92$\n$91n+98 = 92(n+1)$\n$91n+98 = 92n+92$\n$98-92 = 92n-91n$\n$6 = n$\nSo, Brian takes $n+1 = 6+1 = 7$ tests in total.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$\n",

Thus the arithmetic mean of his scores now is $\\frac{S}{n}$ and the arithmetic mean of his scores after getting a 98 on the last test will be $\\frac{S+98}{n+1}$. This gives the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{S}{n} &= 91 & \\frac{S+98}{n+1} & = 92\n\\end{align*} From the first equation we have $S = 91n$.
