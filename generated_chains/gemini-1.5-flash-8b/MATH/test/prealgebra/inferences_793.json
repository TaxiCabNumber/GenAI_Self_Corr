        "inference": "The area of the page is 10 inches by 12 inches, so the area of the page is $10 \\times 12 = 120$ square inches.\nThe margins are 1.5 inches on all sides.\nThe width of the printed area is $10 - 2(1.5) = 10 - 3 = 7$ inches.\nThe height of the printed area is $12 - 2(1.5) = 12 - 3 = 9$ inches.\nThe area of the printed area is $7 \\times 9 = 63$ square inches.\nThe area of the margins is $120 - 63 = 57$ square inches.\nThe fraction of the area of the page taken up by the margins is $\\frac{57}{120}$.\nSimplifying the fraction, we have $\\frac{57}{120} = \\frac{19}{40}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{40}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \\cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\\dfrac{57}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page."
