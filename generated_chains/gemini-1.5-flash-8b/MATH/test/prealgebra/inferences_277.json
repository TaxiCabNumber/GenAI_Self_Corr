At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a survey, students must give exactly one of the answers provided to each of these three questions:\n\n$\\bullet$ a) Were you born before 1990? (Yes / No)\n\n$\\bullet$ b) What is your favorite color? (Red / Green / Blue / Other)\n\n$\\bullet$ c) Do you play a musical instrument?
