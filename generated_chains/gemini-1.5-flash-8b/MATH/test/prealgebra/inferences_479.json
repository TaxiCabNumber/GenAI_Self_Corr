        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCarolyn, Julie and Roberta share $\\$77$ in a ratio of 4:2:1,  respectively.  How many dollars did Carolyn receive?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total parts in the ratio: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 parts.\n\n2. Divide the total amount of money by the total parts to find the value of each part: $77 / 7 = $11 per part.\n\n3. Multiply the value of each part by Carolyn's ratio portion: 4 parts * $11/part = $44.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$44}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The girls essentially divided the $\\$77$ into $4 + 2 + 1 = 7$ equal portions and gave 4 portions to Carolyn, 2 to Julie, and 1 to Roberta.  So each portion is worth $\\frac{\\$77}{7} = \\$ 11$.  Hence Carolyn received $11\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{44}$ dollars."
