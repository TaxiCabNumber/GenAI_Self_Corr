I hope it is correct.'\nExits on a highway are numbered consecutively from 1 to 50. The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km. If each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, what is the longest possible distance, in kilometers, between exit 47 and exit 48?",
        "inference": "The distance from exit 41 to exit 50 is 100 km.  This means there are 50 - 41 = 9 exits between them.  The minimum distance between consecutive exits is 6 km.\nThus, the total distance between exit 41 and exit 50 is at least 6*8 = 48 km.  \nSince the total distance is 100 km, the remaining 100 - 48 = 52 km is due to the extra space.  \n\nThe total space between exit 41 and 50 is divided into 8 intervals.\nTherefore, 52 km / 8 intervals = 6.5 km per interval.\n\nThe maximum possible distance between each exit is 6 km. There are 9 - 1 = 8 intervals.  If each interval has 6 km, the total distance = 8*6 = 48 km.\n\nThis means there are 50-41 = 9 exits between 41 and 50.  \nThe minimum total distance is 8 * 6 = 48 km.\nThe maximum distance is 100 km.  The excess is 100 - 48 = 52 km.\nThis extra 52 km is divided among the 8 intervals (9 exits - 1).  So each interval can have at most 52/8 = 6.5 km.\nThe largest possible space between exit 47 and 48 is 6.5 km.  (The 8 intervals are between exits 41 and 42, 42 and 43, ... 49 and 50)\nThe exit 47 and 48 is the 7th pair between exit 41 and 50.\nThe maximum distance possible is 6.5.\n\nTo maximize the distance between exit 47 and 48, we want to maximize the distance between exit 41 and 42, 42 and 43 ... 47 and 48.\nThe total distance between 41 and 50 is 100 km.  There are 9 exits, so there are 8 intervals.  \nThe minimum distance between each pair of exits is 6 km.  8*6 = 48 km.  \nThe remaining distance is 100 - 48 = 52 km. This distance is distributed among the 8 intervals.  \nSo each interval has at most 52/8 = 6.5 km.\nTherefore the longest possible distance between 47 and 48 is 6.5 km.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.5}$",
        "ground_truth": "To make the distance between exit $47$ and exit $48$ as long as possible, we want to make the distance between any other two consecutive exits as short as possible (that is, $6$ km). There are nine distances between exits from exit $41$ to exit $50$; eight that we want to make as short as possible and one that we want to make as long as possible.
