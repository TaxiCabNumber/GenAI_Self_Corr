        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "inference": "Let A be the total number of adults in Mathopolis.\nLet F be the number of female adults.\nLet C be the number of children.\nHalf of the adults are female, so F = A/2.\nHalf of the female adults have exactly one child. Thus, the number of children is C = F/2 = (A/2)/2 = A/4.\nThe total population is A + C = A + A/4 = 5A/4.\nThe percentage of children is (C / (A + C)) * 100 = (A/4) / (5A/4) * 100 = (A/4) * (4/5A) * 100 = 1/5 * 100 = 20.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$% I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
