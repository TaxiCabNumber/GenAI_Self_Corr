        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf each 1/2 inch on a map represents 20 miles, how many inches apart on the map are two cities whose actual distance apart is 120 miles?",
        "inference": "1. We are given that 1/2 inch on the map represents 20 miles in reality.\n2. We need to find the number of inches on the map that represent 120 miles.\n3. We can set up a proportion: (1/2 inch) / (20 miles) = (x inches) / (120 miles)\n4. Cross-multiply: 20x = (1/2) * 120\n5. Simplify: 20x = 60\n6. Solve for x: x = 60 / 20\n7. Calculate x: x = 3\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $20\\times 6=120$, we multiply 1/2 inches times 6 to get $\\boxed{3}$ inches for the distance between the cities on the map."
