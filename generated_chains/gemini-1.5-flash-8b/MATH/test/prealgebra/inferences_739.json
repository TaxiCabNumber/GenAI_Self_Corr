At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "We are looking for positive integers less than 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 4.  This means we want to find integers that are divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4.\nThe LCM(3, 4) = 12.\nWe want to find the multiples of 12 that are less than 100.\nThe multiples of 12 are:\n12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96\nThere are 8 such multiples.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If we start counting from 1, every third consecutive integer is divisible by 3 and every fourth consecutive integer is divisible by 4. So every twelfth integer is divisible by both 3 and 4. Therefore, the number of positive integers less than 100 divisible by both 3 and 4 is just equal to the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 12.  $100 \\div 12 = 8 \\text{ R } 4$, so there are $\\boxed{8}$ multiples of 12 between 1 and 100."
