        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMax must take 10 steps to go the same distance as three of his dad's steps. His dad takes 30 steps to walk down the hall. How many steps must Max take to walk down the same hall?",
        "inference": "Max takes 10 steps for every 3 of his dad's steps.\nHis dad takes 30 steps.\nSo, Max takes (10 steps / 3 dad steps) * 30 dad steps = 100 steps.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Using the given information, we have the ratio $10 \\text{ Max steps} : 3 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get the ratio $100 \\text{ Max steps} : 30 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Thus, $30$ of his dad's steps are the same as $\\boxed{100}$ of his steps."
