        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBrass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?",
        "inference": "If the brass trumpet contains 80% copper and 20% zinc, and contains 48 ounces of copper, then the total amount of brass is $\\frac{48}{0.80} = 60$ ounces.\nThe amount of zinc is $20\\%$ of 60 ounces.\n$0.20 \\times 60 = 12$ ounces.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ ounces. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc."
