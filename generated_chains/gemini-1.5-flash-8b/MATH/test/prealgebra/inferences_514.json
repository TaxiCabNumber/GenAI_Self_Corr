        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
        "inference": "1. Let $d_e$ be the distance the elephant travels and $d_l$ be the distance the lion travels.\n2. The relative speed of the lion towards the elephant is $19 + 24 = 43$ miles per hour.\n3. The distance between the elephant and the lion is initially 1 mile.\n4. The time it takes for the lion to catch the elephant is the time it takes for the lion to cover the 1-mile distance at the relative speed of 43 miles per hour.\n5. Time = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 43 miles per hour = 1/43 hours.\n6. To convert the time from hours to minutes, multiply by 60: (1/43) hours * 60 minutes/hour = 60/43 minutes.\n7. Calculate 60/43:  60/43 \u2248 1.3953 minutes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.4}$ minutes. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19.  Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour.  The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes."
