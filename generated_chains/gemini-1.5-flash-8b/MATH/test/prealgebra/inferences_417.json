At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 numbers from the set $1-15$ in the first column, 5 numbers from $16-30$ in the second column, 4 numbers $31-45$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 numbers from $46-60$ in the fourth column and 5 numbers from $61-75$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$31$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$32$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$34$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$35$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$50$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$49$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$48$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$47$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$46$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$71$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$72$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$73$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$74$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$75$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.  A player wins when he marks 5 in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nHow many distinct possibilities are there for the values in the diagonal going from top left to bottom right of a BINGO card, in order?",
