        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes $8$ cups of chocolate chips to make $12$ cookies. How many cups of chocolate chips will it take to make $15$ cookies?",
        "inference": "1. Find the rate of chocolate chips per cookie:\n   8 cups / 12 cookies = 2/3 cup/cookie\n\n2. Multiply the rate by the number of cookies needed:\n   (2/3 cup/cookie) * 15 cookies = 10 cups\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The proportion of cups of chocolate chips to cookies is constant and can be simplified as $\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, if $x$ is the number of cups of chocolate chips it will take to make $15$ cookies, $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{15}$. Solving for $x$ gives an answer of $\\boxed{10}$ cups.\n\nBy the way, $\\frac{2}{3}$ cup of chips for a cookie? Wowzers."
