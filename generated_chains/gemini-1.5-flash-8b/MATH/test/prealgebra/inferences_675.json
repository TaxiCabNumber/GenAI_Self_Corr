At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI am going to buy exotic fruits.  Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars.  Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",
        "inference": "1. Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit, so rambutan costs $(x-4) + 2x = 3x - 4$ dollars.\n\n2. Starfruit costs five dollars less than rambutan, so starfruit costs $(3x - 4) - 5 = 3x - 9$ dollars.\n\n3. To find the cost of one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit, we sum the costs:\n   Rambutan: $3x - 4$\n   Two starfruit: $2(3x - 9) = 6x - 18$\n   Three dragonfruit: $3(x - 4) = 3x - 12$\n   Total cost: $(3x - 4) + (6x - 18) + (3x - 12) = 3x + 6x + 3x - 4 - 18 - 12 = 12x - 34$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12x-34}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that one dragonfruit is $x-4$ dollars.  This means that one rambutan is $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars.  Then, one starfruit is $(3x-4) -5 = 3x-9$ dollars. We want to find $1 \\cdot (3x-4) + 2 \\cdot (3x-9) + 3 \\cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$. Finally, we combine like terms, yielding $(3x + 6x + 3x) + (-4 + -18 + -12) = (12x) + (-34)$.  We obtain $\\boxed{12x -34}$, or $\\boxed{-34 + 12x}$."
