        "inference": "Let the dimensions of rectangle A be $a$ meters by $b$ meters. The area of rectangle A is $ab = 40$. Possible integer pairs $(a,b)$ are (1,40), (2,20), (4,10), (5,8), (8,5), (10,4), (20,2), (40,1). The width of A is given as 8 meters, so $b=8$. Then $a=5$. The height of rectangle A is 5 meters.\n\nRectangle B has dimensions $b_1$ meters by 5 meters. The area of rectangle B is $b_1 \\times 5 = 25$. Thus, $b_1 = 5$.\nRectangle C has width 8 meters and is placed above rectangle A. The height of rectangle C is $h_c = 6 - 5 = 1$ meter (since the total height of A and C together is 6 meters). The area of rectangle C is width $\\times$ height = $8 \\times 1 = 8$ square meters. This is not correct.  The area of rectangle C is given as 30 square meters.\nSo, the width of rectangle C is 8 meters, and the area is $8 \\times h_c = 30$, thus $h_c = 30/8 = 3.75$ meters. This height is not an integer, which suggests there is an error in the problem statement. \n\nRectangle D has width 8 meters.  The height of rectangle D is the total height of the structure (6 meters) minus the heights of A and C ($5+1.25 = 6.25$).  We need more information to determine the height of D. The problem statement doesn't specify the height of rectangle C correctly. We can't determine the height of D, so we need correct information about rectangle C.\nSince the problem states the area of C is 30 square meters and the width is 8 meters, the height must be 30/8 = 3.75 meters. The total height is 6.\nRectangle D's height is the remaining height: $6 - 5 - 3.75 = -2.75$. This is impossible, which indicates an error in the problem statement.\nAssume the height of rectangle C is given correctly as 1 meter.\nRectangle C has dimensions 8 meters by 3.75 meters and area is 30 square meters.\nRectangle D has a width of 8 meters.  We do not know the area, but we know the total height is 6 meters.  If the height of rectangle A is 5 meters, and the height of rectangle C is 1 meter, the height of rectangle D is 6-1-5 = 0. This does not make sense.\nThe provided text does not give enough information to calculate the area of Rectangle D correctly.\n\nIf we assume that rectangle C has width 8 and height 3.75 (and area 30), then the height of D is 6-5=1. Thus the height of D is 1, not 0. In that case, we can't calculate the area of rectangle D from the information given.\n\n\nFinal Answer: The provided information is insufficient to determine the area of rectangle D.  The problem needs to be corrected.  $\\boxed{Insufficient Information}$",
