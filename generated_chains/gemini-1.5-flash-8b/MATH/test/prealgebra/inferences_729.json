At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n12 balls numbered 1 through 12 are placed in a bin.  In how many ways can 3 balls be drawn, in order, from the bin, if the first ball is replaced after it is drawn but the second ball remains outside the bin?",
        "inference": "1. The first ball can be any of the 12 balls.\n2. There are 11 balls remaining in the bin after the first ball is drawn and replaced.  The second ball can be any of these 11 balls.\n3. The third ball can be any of the remaining 10 balls in the bin.\n4. The number of ways to draw the balls in order is the product of the number of choices for each ball.\nTherefore, the number of ways is 12 * 11 * 10 = 1320.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1320}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
