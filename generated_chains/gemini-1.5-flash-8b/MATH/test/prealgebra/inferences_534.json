At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 3:20, what is the measure in degrees of the lesser angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand?",
        "inference": "The minute hand is at the 4, which is 120 degrees from the 12.  The hour hand is 3/60 = 1/20 of the way from the 3 to the 4.  This is 30 degrees * (1/20) = 1.5 degrees past the 3.\n\nThe 3 is at 90 degrees.  The minute hand is at 120 degrees. The hour hand is at 90 + 1.5 = 91.5 degrees.\n\nThe difference between 120 and 91.5 is 28.5 degrees.  The lesser angle is 28.5 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28.5}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "At 3:20, the minute hand is at the 4, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock, therefore, $120$ degrees from the top.  The hour hand, at the beginning of the hour, started at the 3, but since we are $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way through the hour, the hour hand will have traveled $\\frac{1}{3}$ the arc from 3 to 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is another 10 degrees further clockwise, meaning the measure of the angle between the two hands is $120 - 100 = \\boxed{20\\text{ degrees}}$."
