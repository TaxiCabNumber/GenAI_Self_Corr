At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?",
        "inference": "A full rotation is 360 degrees.\nDivide 2250 by 360 to find how many full rotations she makes: 2250 / 360 = 6 with a remainder of 150.\nShe makes 6 full rotations and then an additional 150 degrees.\nSince a full rotation takes the skater back to the same direction, 6 full rotations don't change her direction.\nThe additional 150 degrees is 150 degrees to the right of north.\n150 degrees is in the east direction.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{east}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$."
