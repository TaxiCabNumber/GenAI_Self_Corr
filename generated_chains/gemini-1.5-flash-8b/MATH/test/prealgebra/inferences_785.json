At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA class of 30 students recently took a test.  If 20 students scored 80, 8 students scored 90, and 2 students scored 100, then what was the class average (the mean) on this test?",
        "inference": "Sum of scores from 20 students who scored 80 = 20 * 80 = 1600\nSum of scores from 8 students who scored 90 = 8 * 90 = 720\nSum of scores from 2 students who scored 100 = 2 * 100 = 200\nTotal sum of all scores = 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\nTotal number of students = 20 + 8 + 2 = 30\nClass average = Total sum of scores / Total number of students = 2520 / 30 = 84\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "From the given information, the total amount of marks obtained by the class is   $$20(80)+8(90)+2(100)=2520.$$Therefore, the class average is  $$\\frac{2520}{30} = \\boxed{84}.$$"
