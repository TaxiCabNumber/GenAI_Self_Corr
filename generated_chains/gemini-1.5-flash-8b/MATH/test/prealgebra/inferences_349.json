The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1440^\\circ}{10} = 144^\\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular pentagon has measure $\\frac{540^\\circ}{5} = 108^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the desired difference is $144^\\circ - 108^\\circ = \\boxed{36^\\circ}$."
