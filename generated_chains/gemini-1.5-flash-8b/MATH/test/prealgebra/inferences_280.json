        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 2004th positive odd integer?",

I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first positive odd integer is 1.  To get to the 2004th positive odd integer, we must add 2 exactly 2003 times.  Make sure you see why it's not 2004 times -- that would give us the 2005th positive odd integer, just like adding one 2 to 1 gives us the second positive odd integer, not the first.  Therefore, our answer is $1 + 2003\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{4007}$."
