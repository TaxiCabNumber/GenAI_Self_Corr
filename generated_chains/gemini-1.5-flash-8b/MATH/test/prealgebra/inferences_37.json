At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup consisted of several groups of four teams each. Within each group, each of the four teams played each other once. How many matches were there in each group?",
        "inference": "To find the number of matches in each group, we need to determine how many games each team played.\nEach team played every other team in the group once.\nA group has 4 teams.\nTeam 1 played teams 2, 3, and 4.\nTeam 2 played teams 1, 3, and 4.\nTeam 3 played teams 1, 2, and 4.\nTeam 4 played teams 1, 2, and 3.\nThis means team 1 played 3 matches.\nTeam 2 played 3 matches.\nTeam 3 played 3 matches.\nTeam 4 played 3 matches.\nHowever, this counts each match twice (once for each team involved).\nFor example, the match between team 1 and team 2 is counted once for team 1 and once for team 2.\nSo, the total number of matches is the sum of matches played by each team divided by 2.\nTotal matches = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since there were four teams in each group, they each must have played each other once, meaning that at first glance, there seem to be $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ pairs of teams. However, that counts each match twice, so we must divide by $2$ and we have $\\boxed{6},$ our answer."
