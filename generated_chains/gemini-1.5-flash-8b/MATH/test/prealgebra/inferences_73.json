        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the national curling championships, there are three teams of four players each. After the championships are over, the very courteous participants each shake hands three times with every member of the opposing teams, and once with each member of their own team.\n\nHow many handshakes are there in total?",
        "inference": "1. There are 3 teams, each with 4 players.  Total players = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n2. Each player shakes hands with each member of the opposing teams.  There are 2 opposing teams, each with 4 players.  So each player shakes hands with 4 * 2 = 8 players from the opposing teams.\n\n3. Each player also shakes hands with each member of their own team.  This means each player shakes hands with 3 other players on their own team.\n\n4. The total handshakes per player = 8 (opposing teams) + 3 (own team) = 11 handshakes per player.\n\n5. Total handshakes = (11 handshakes/player) * (12 players) / 2  (because each handshake is counted twice) = 66 handshakes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "For each participant, there are 8 opponents to shake hands with, and 3 team members to shake hands with, giving $3\\times8+3=27$ handshakes for each individual participant.\n\nThere are 12 players in total, which offers $12\\times27=324$ handshakes, but since a handshake takes place between two people, we've counted every handshake twice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\dfrac{324}{2}=\\boxed{162}$ handshakes."
