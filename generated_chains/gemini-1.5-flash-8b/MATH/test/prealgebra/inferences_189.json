At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSharon bought a mixture of nuts that was made up of pecans, walnuts and cashews in a ratio by weight of $2:3:1$, respectively. If she bought $9$ pounds of nuts, how many pounds of walnuts were in the mixture? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "Let $P$, $W$, and $C$ represent the weights of pecans, walnuts, and cashews, respectively.\nThe ratio of the weights is $2:3:1$.\nLet $k$ be a constant such that $P = 2k$, $W = 3k$, and $C = 1k$.\nThe total weight of the mixture is $P + W + C = 2k + 3k + 1k = 6k$.\nThe total weight is given as 9 pounds. So, $6k = 9$.\nSolving for $k$, we have $k = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.\nThe weight of walnuts is $W = 3k = 3(1.5) = 4.5$ pounds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4.5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture."
