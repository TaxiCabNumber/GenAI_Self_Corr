Express your answer in the form $a:b$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.",
        "inference": "1. The circumference of a circle with radius $r$ is given by $C = 2\\pi r$.\n2. The circumference of a circle with radius 1.125 is $C_1 = 2\\pi(1.125) = 2.25\\pi$.\n3. The diameter of a circle is twice its radius. So, a circle with diameter 2.25 has radius $r_2 = \\frac{2.25}{2} = 1.125$.\n4. The circumference of a circle with diameter 2.25 is $C_2 = \\pi(2.25) = 2.25\\pi$.\n5. The ratio of the circumference of the circle with radius 1.125 to the circumference of the circle with diameter 2.25 is $\\frac{C_1}{C_2} = \\frac{2.25\\pi}{2.25\\pi} = 1$.\n6. The ratio is $1:1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1:1}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If a circle has diameter $2.25$, then its radius must be half of that which is $1.125$. Thus, both circles have radius $1.125$, so their circumferences must be equal and in a ratio of $\\boxed{1:1}$."
