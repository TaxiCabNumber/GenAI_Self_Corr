At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Heidi's history class, the only grades that count toward the semester average are the $6$ tests she has already taken and the upcoming final exam. The final exam counts as two tests. Heidi has determined that if she earns $99$ points on the final she will have exactly a $90$-point average for the semester. On average, how many points has Heidi scored on each test prior to the final exam?",
