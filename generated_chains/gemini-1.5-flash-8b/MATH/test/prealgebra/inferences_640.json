At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 3:2:1. Given that the shortest side of the triangle is 12 meters long, what is the number of meters in the longest side of the triangle?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the angles is 3:2:1.  This means the angles are 3x, 2x, and x.\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So 3x + 2x + x = 180.  This simplifies to 6x = 180, so x = 30.\nThe angles are 90, 60, and 30 degrees.\nThe sides opposite the angles are in the ratio 3:2:1.  The shortest side (opposite the smallest angle) is 12 meters.\nThis means the ratio 1 corresponds to 12 meters.  Therefore, the ratio 3 corresponds to 3 * 12 = 36 meters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\\circ$, so $x=30^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ meters."
