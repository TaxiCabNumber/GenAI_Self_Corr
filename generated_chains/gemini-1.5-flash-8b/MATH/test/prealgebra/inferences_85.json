        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of four circles has a radius of 4 inches. A larger circle has an area equal to the total area of the four smaller circles. What is the length of the radius, in inches, of the larger circle?",
        "inference": "1. Area of one small circle:  A = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(4\u00b2) = 16\u03c0 square inches.\n2. Total area of four small circles: 4 * 16\u03c0 = 64\u03c0 square inches.\n3. Area of the larger circle:  64\u03c0 square inches.\n4. Let the radius of the larger circle be R.  The area of the larger circle is \u03c0R\u00b2.\n5.  \u03c0R\u00b2 = 64\u03c0\n6.  R\u00b2 = 64\n7.  R = \u221a64 = 8 inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the length of the radius of a circle is multiplied by a factor of $k$, then the area of the circle is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$.  Since the larger circle has area 4 times greater than that of each smaller circle, the length of its radius is 2 times greater.  Therefore, the length of its radius is $2\\times 4\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{8}$ inches."

        "inference": "The problem statement is flawed.  If the four small circles are arranged such that their centers form a square and are tangent to each other and to the large circle, then the radius of the large circle is *not* 8.  Instead, the diameter of the large circle is equal to the diameter of one small circle plus 2 * the radius of a small circle, or the radius of the large circle = radius of one small circle + radius of one small circle.  Given that the radius of each small circle is 4 inches, the radius of the large circle is 2 * 4 = 8 inches.\n\n\n$\\boxed{8}$\n",
