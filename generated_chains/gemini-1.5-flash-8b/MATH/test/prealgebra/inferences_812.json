At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a number $C$. The number $C$ is a multiple of 7, but is NOT a multiple of 3. The number $C$ is greater than 20, but less than 30. What is this number $C$?",

        "ground_truth": "From the problem we can gather that $20<C<30$. Because $C$ is also a multiple of 7, that limits the possibilities for number $C$ down to 21 and 28. The last clue left states that number $C$ is also NOT a multiple of 3. Out of the two posibilities left, 21 is the only value that is also a multiple of 3, thus eliminating it from being number $C$. Thus, the number $C$ can only be $\\boxed{28}$."
