At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many odd five-digit counting numbers can be formed by  choosing digits from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ if digits can be repeated?",

Since digits can be repeated, there are 7 choices for each of the first four digits.\nThus, the number of odd five-digit counting numbers is $7 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 4 = 7^4 \\times 4 = 2401 \\times 4 = 9604$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9604}$\n",
