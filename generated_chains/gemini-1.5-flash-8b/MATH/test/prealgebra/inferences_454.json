        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStacey is standing in a field. She walks 11 meters west, 30 meters north, 4 meters west and finally 22 meters south. How many meters is she from her starting point?",
        "inference": "1. Westward displacement: 11 meters + 4 meters = 15 meters west\n2. Northward displacement: 30 meters north\n3. Southward displacement: 22 meters south\n4. Net northward displacement: 30 meters - 22 meters = 8 meters north\n5. Net westward displacement: 15 meters west\n6. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the total displacement from the starting point:\n   distance = \u221a(15\u00b2 + 8\u00b2)\n   distance = \u221a(225 + 64)\n   distance = \u221a289\n   distance = 17 meters\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Stacey walks $11+4=15$ meters west in total, and she walks a net of $30-22=8$ meters north.  By the Pythagorean theorem, she is $\\sqrt{8^2+15^2}=\\boxed{17\\text{ meters}}$ from her starting point."
