At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct diagonals of a convex hexagon can be drawn?",
        "inference": "A convex hexagon has 6 vertices.  A diagonal connects two non-adjacent vertices.  The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 6 vertices is $\\binom{6}{2}$.  This includes all possible segments connecting two vertices, including sides.  The number of sides is 6.  So, the number of diagonals is $\\binom{6}{2} - 6 = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 3 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 6 vertices in a hexagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $6\\times 3 = 18$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{18}{2} = \\boxed{9}$ distinct diagonals in a convex hexagon."
