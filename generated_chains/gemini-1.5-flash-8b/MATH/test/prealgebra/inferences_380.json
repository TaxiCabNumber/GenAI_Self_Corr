        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the probability that when a fair 6-sided die is rolled, a prime number faces up?",
        "inference": "The prime numbers between 1 and 6 are 2, 3, and 5.  There are 3 prime numbers.  There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die.  The probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes: 3/6 = 1/2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "In this problem there are 6 equally likely outcomes.  Three of those outcomes, 2, 3, and 5, are successful.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
