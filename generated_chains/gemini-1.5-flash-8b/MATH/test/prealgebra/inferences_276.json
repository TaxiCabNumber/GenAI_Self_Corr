At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy classroom has 11 rows of chairs, with 11 chairs in each row.  The chairs in each row are numbered from 1 to 11.  How many chairs have odd numbers?",
        "inference": "There are 11 rows, with 11 chairs in each row.\nIn each row, the chairs are numbered 1 to 11.\nThe odd numbers in the range 1 to 11 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.  There are 6 odd numbers.\nSince there are 11 rows, and 6 odd numbers in each row, the total number of chairs with odd numbers is 11 * 6 = 66.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each row has odd-numbered chairs $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11$ for a total of 6 odd-numbered chairs in each row.  Since there are 11 rows, there are a total number of $11 \\times 6 = \\boxed{66}$ chairs with odd numbers."
