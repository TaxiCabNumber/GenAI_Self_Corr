At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a bag with 20 marbles, five of them are blue. How many blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $\\frac{1}{2}$?",
        "inference": "Let $B$ be the number of blue marbles initially in the bag, and $T$ be the total number of marbles in the bag.\nInitially, $B = 5$ and $T = 20$.\nThe probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $P(B) = \\frac{B}{T} = \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of blue marbles added to the bag.\nThe new number of blue marbles is $B' = B + x = 5 + x$.\nThe new total number of marbles is $T' = T + x = 20 + x$.\nThe new probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $P(B') = \\frac{B'}{T'} = \\frac{5+x}{20+x}$.\nWe are given that the new probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So we have the equation\n$$\\frac{5+x}{20+x} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nCross-multiplying gives\n$$2(5+x) = 1(20+x)$$\n$$10 + 2x = 20 + x$$\n$$2x - x = 20 - 10$$\n$$x = 10$$\nSo 10 blue marbles must be added to the bag.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If we add $x$ blue marbles, then the fraction of blue marbles in the bag will be $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}$. We want this to equal $1/2$, so $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}= \\frac{1}{2}$. Clearing the fractions, we have $10 + 2x = 20 + x$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{10}$."
