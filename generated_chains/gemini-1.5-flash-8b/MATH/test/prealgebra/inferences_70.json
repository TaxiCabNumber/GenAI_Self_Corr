        "inference": "The ray BA goes through the 85-degree mark, and the ray BC goes through the 30-degree mark.  The angle ABC is formed by these two rays.  To find the measure of angle ABC, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle.  In this case, the larger angle is 85 degrees and the smaller angle is 30 degrees.
