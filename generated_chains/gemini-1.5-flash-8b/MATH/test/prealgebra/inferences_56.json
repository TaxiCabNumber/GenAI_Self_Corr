At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHadley scored 92, 73, 79, and 87 points on the first four tests of the quarter. There is one test remaining. What is the minimum number of points that Hadley must score on the final test in order to have a mean of 80 points for the five tests?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total points from the first four tests: 92 + 73 + 79 + 87 = 331.\n\n2. To have a mean of 80 for five tests, the total points for all five tests must be 80 * 5 = 400.\n\n3. Calculate the required points on the final test: 400 - 331 = 69.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{69}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If five scores have a mean of 80, then their sum is $80\\cdot5=400$.  Since the first four scores add up to 331, the fifth score must be at least $400-331=\\boxed{69}$."
