        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe only garments that a particular factory produces are  dresses and shirts. It produces three\tdresses for every five shirts  it makes. If the factory produced a total of 72 garments today,  how many dresses did it make?",
        "inference": "Let 'd' be the number of dresses and 's' be the number of shirts.\nThe ratio of dresses to shirts is 3:5.  This means d/s = 3/5, or d = (3/5)s.\nThe total number of garments is 72, so d + s = 72.\nSubstitute the first equation into the second: (3/5)s + s = 72.\nCombine the terms: (8/5)s = 72.\nMultiply both sides by 5/8: s = (72 * 5)/8 = 9 * 5 = 45.\nNow find the number of dresses: d = (3/5) * 45 = 3 * 9 = 27.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the factory produces 3 dresses for every 5 shirts, that means it produces 3 dresses out of every 8 garments. So we multiply the fraction $\\frac{3}{8}$ by the number of garments, 72, and get $\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot72=3\\cdot9=\\boxed{27}$ dresses."
