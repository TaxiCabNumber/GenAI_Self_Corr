At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that we roll two fair 6-sided dice.  What is the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4?",
        "inference": "The possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice are pairs of numbers (a, b) where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 6 and 1 \u2264 b \u2264 6. The total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\nThe pairs of numbers that sum to 4 are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 1).\nThere are 3 such pairs.\nThe probability of rolling a sum of 4 is the number of favorable outcomes (pairs that sum to 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\nProbability = 3/36 = 1/12.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
