        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard six-sided die was rolled 50 times, and the outcomes are shown in the table. What is the average of the 50 outcomes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nOutcome&$\\#$ of Occurrences\\\\\\hline\n1&14\\\\\\hline\n2&5\\\\\\hline\n3&9\\\\\\hline\n4&7\\\\\\hline\n5&7\\\\\\hline\n6&8\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
        "inference": "To find the average, we sum the products of each outcome and its corresponding frequency, then divide by the total number of rolls.\nSum of (outcome * frequency) = (1*14) + (2*5) + (3*9) + (4*7) + (5*7) + (6*8) = 14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162\nTotal number of rolls = 14 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 50\nAverage = Sum of (outcome * frequency) / Total number of rolls = 162 / 50 = 3.24\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3.24}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The total of the 50 outcomes is $(14 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 2) + (9 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 4) + (7 \\times 5) + (8 \\times 6) = 14 + 10 + 27 + 28 + 35 + 48 = 162.$ Dividing this by 50, we find that the average roll was $\\boxed{3.24}$."
