        "inference": "The problem states that a rectangle is formed by placing two squares side by side.  Let the side length of each square be $x$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2x$ and the width is $x$. The perimeter is given as 60 cm.  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is $2(\\text{length} + \\text{width})$. So, $2(2x + x) = 60$.  This simplifies to $6x = 60$, which gives $x = 10$.  The area of the rectangle is length \u00d7 width = $2x \\times x = 2x^2$.  Substituting $x=10$, we get $2(10^2) = 2(100) = 200$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$",
