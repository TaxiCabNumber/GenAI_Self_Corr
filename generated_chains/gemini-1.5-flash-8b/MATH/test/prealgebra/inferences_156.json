        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular January day, the high temperature in Lincoln, Nebraska, was $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, and the average of the high and the low temperatures was $3\\,^\\circ$. In degrees, what was the low temperature in Lincoln that day?",
        "inference": "Let the low temperature be $L$ and the high temperature be $H$.\nWe are given that the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature. Thus, $H = L + 16$.\nThe average of the high and low temperatures is $3^\\circ$. So, $\\frac{H+L}{2} = 3$.\nSubstituting $H = L+16$ into the equation, we get:\n$\\frac{(L+16)+L}{2} = 3$\n$\\frac{2L+16}{2} = 3$\n$L+8 = 3$\n$L = 3 - 8$\n$L = -5$\nThe low temperature is $-5^\\circ$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, it follows that the average of the two temperatures, which lies halfway between the high and low temperatures, must be $8$ degrees higher than the low temperature and $8$ degrees lower than the high temperature. Thus, if the average is $3^\\circ,$ then the low temperature is $3^\\circ - 8^\\circ = \\boxed{-5^\\circ}.$"
