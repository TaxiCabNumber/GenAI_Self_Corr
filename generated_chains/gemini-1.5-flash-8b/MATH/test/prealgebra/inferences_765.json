        "inference": "The largest factor of a number less than the number itself is not the number itself, but the number's greatest divisor other than the number itself.  Since 54,321 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., we need to find the largest factor other than 54,321.  \nTo find the factors of 54,321, we need to find the largest integer that divides 54,321 without a remainder.  Finding the factors one by one is inefficient, so we need to use prime factorization if possible.\n\n54321 = 3 * 18107\n18107 is prime\nThus, the factors of 54321 are 1, 3, 18107, and 54321.
