        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo-thirds of the students at Baker Middle School take music. There are 834 students who take music. How many students are there at Baker Middle School?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the total number of students at Baker Middle School.\nTwo-thirds of the students take music, so (2/3)x = 834.\nMultiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:\nx = (834) * (3/2)\nx = 417 * 3\nx = 1251\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1251}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $S$ students at Baker Middle School, then $\\frac{2}{3}S$ students take music.  Setting $\\frac{2}{3}S$ equal to 834 and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we find that there are $\\frac{3}{2}\\times 834=\\boxed{1251}$ students at the school."
