        "inference": "1. The mean of the set $\\{6, x, 22\\}$ is $\\frac{6+x+22}{3} = \\frac{x+28}{3}$.\n\n2. The set is ordered, so the possible orderings are $\\{6, x, 22\\}$, $\\{6, 22, x\\}$, $\\{x, 6, 22\\}$, $\\{x, 22, 6\\}$, $\\{22, 6, x\\}$, $\\{22, x, 6\\}$.  Since the set is increasing, the median is in the middle position.\n\n3. If the order is $\\{6, x, 22\\}$, the median is $x$.\n   If the order is $\\{6, 22, x\\}$, the median is $x$.\n   If the order is $\\{x, 6, 22\\}$, the median is $6$.\n   If the order is $\\{x, 22, 6\\}$, the order is incorrect since the set must be increasing.\n   If the order is $\\{22, 6, x\\}$, the order is incorrect since the set must be increasing.\n   If the order is $\\{22, x, 6\\}$, the order is incorrect since the set must be increasing.\n\n4. Case 1: The set is $\\{6, x, 22\\}$ with $6 < x < 22$. The median is $x$, and the mean is $\\frac{x+28}{3}$. Thus, we have $x = \\frac{x+28}{3}$.\n   $3x = x + 28$\n   $2x = 28$\n   $x = 14$\n\n5. Case 2: The set is $\\{6, 22, x\\}$ with $6 < 22 < x$. The median is $x$, but the mean is $\\frac{6+22+x}{3} = \\frac{28+x}{3}$, so $\\frac{28+x}{3} = 22$.\n    $28+x = 66$.\n   $x=38$\n   However, $22<x$ and $x=38$ does not fit in this ordering, so this case is invalid.\n\n6. Case 3: The set is $\\{x, 6, 22\\}$ with $6<x<22$. The median is $6$, so the mean must be equal to $6$.\n   $\\frac{x+6+22}{3} = \\frac{x+28}{3} = 6$.\n   $x+28=18$, which gives $x=-10$.\n   Since $x$ must be greater than $6$, this case is invalid.\n\n7. Thus, the only valid case is $\\{6, 14, 22\\}$, where the median is $14$ and the mean is $\\frac{6+14+22}{3} = \\frac{42}{3} = 14$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The mean of the set is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers (which is 3), so the mean is $\\frac{6+x+22}{3}$.
