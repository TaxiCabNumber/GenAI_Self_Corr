        "ground_truth": "We first calculate the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 0 through 99.  If we consider all such numbers as two-digit (e.g. write 04 instead of 4), the sum of digits will be unchanged.  Then we see that each digit appears an equal number of times in the ones place, and similarly for the tens place, meaning it appears a total of $2\\cdot \\frac{100}{10} = 20$ times.  Thus the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 00 through 99 is $20\\cdot (0 + 1 +\\cdots + 8 + 9) = 900$.  The sum of the digits from 100 to 110 is just $(1 + 0) + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2) + \\cdots + (1+9) + 2 = 57$.  Thus our final answer is $900 + 57 = \\boxed{957}$."

        "inference": "To find the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 999, we can use the method of grouping.\n\nFor numbers from 1 to 9, the sum of digits is 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45.\nFor numbers from 10 to 99, the units digit is 0, 1, ..., 9, each appearing 10 times. The tens digit is 1, 2, ..., 9, each appearing 10 times. So, the sum of the digits for numbers from 10 to 99 is 10 * (1 + 2 + ... + 9) + 10 * (0 + 1 + ... + 9) = 10 * 45 + 10 * 45 = 450 * 2 = 900.\nFor numbers from 1 to 99, the sum is 45 + 900 = 45 + 450 = 495.\n\nFor numbers from 100 to 999, consider the hundreds digit: It can be 1, 2, ..., 9. Each of these digits appear 100 times.\nThe tens digit can be 0, 1, ..., 9, appearing 100 times for each hundreds digit. Similarly, the units digit can be 0, 1, ..., 9, appearing 100 times for each hundreds digit.\nThe sum of the digits for the hundreds digit is 100 * (1 + 2 + ... + 9) = 100 * 45 = 4500.\nThe sum of the digits for the tens digit is 100 * (0 + 1 + ... + 9) = 100 * 45 = 4500.\nThe sum of the digits for the units digit is 100 * (0 + 1 + ... + 9) = 100 * 45 = 4500.\nThus, the sum of digits for numbers from 100 to 999 is 4500 + 4500 + 4500 = 13500.\nThe total sum of digits from 1 to 999 is 45 + 450 + 13500 = 14000 + 5 - 100 + 45 = 14000 - 50 + 45 = 13995.\nThe total sum of digits from 1 to 999 is 45 + 450 + 13500 = 14000 + 15 = 14000 + 45 + 450 - 450 = 14000 + 15 - 14000 = 13995. \nThus, the sum of digits is 45+450+13500=13500 + 45 + 450 = 13995.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{13995}$",
