        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bicycle is traveling at 20 feet per minute. What is the bicycle's speed expressed in inches per second?",
        "inference": "1 foot = 12 inches\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\nSpeed in feet per minute = 20 feet/minute\nSpeed in inches per second = (20 feet/minute) * (12 inches/1 foot) * (1 minute/60 seconds)\nSpeed in inches per second = (20 * 12) / 60 inches/second\nSpeed in inches per second = 240 / 60 inches/second\nSpeed in inches per second = 4 inches/second\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$ inches/second. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the bicycle is traveling at $12(20)=240$ inches per minute.  There are $60$ seconds in a minute, so the bicycle is traveling at $\\frac{240}{60}=\\boxed{4}$ inches per second."
