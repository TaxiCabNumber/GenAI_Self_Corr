At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe distance between two cities on a map is 4 centimeters. If the scale is 0.5 cm:1 km, how many kilometers apart are the actual cities?",
        "inference": "1. The scale is 0.5 cm : 1 km.\n2. This means 0.5 cm on the map represents 1 km in reality.\n3. The distance on the map is 4 cm.\n4. To find the actual distance, we set up a proportion:  (0.5 cm) / (1 km) = (4 cm) / (x km)\n5. Solving for x:  0.5 * x = 4 * 1, which simplifies to 0.5x = 4.\n6. Dividing both sides by 0.5: x = 8\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We have the ratio $$0.5 \\text{ cm on the map} : 1 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 2, we have the equivalent ratio $$1 \\text{ cm on the map} : 2 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 4, we find the equivalent ratio$$4 \\text{ cm on the map} : 8 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{8}$ kilometers apart in reality."
