At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA juice company sells its product in either a 48-ounce size or a 32-ounce size. It charges $\\$3.90$ for the 48-ounce size. How much should it charge for the smaller size if it wants the price per ounce to be $25\\%$ more than the price per ounce of the larger size?",
        "inference": "The price per ounce of the 48-ounce size is $3.90/48 = \\$0.08125$ per ounce.\nThe juice company wants the price per ounce of the 32-ounce size to be 25% more than the price per ounce of the larger size.\nSo, the price per ounce of the 32-ounce size should be $0.08125 \\times 1.25 = \\$0.1015625$ per ounce.\nThe price for the 32-ounce size should be $0.1015625 \\times 32 = \\$3.25$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$3.25}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We could solve this problem by figuring out the per-ounce cost of the 48-ounce package, increasing it by $25\\%$, and then multiplying that by 32 for the smaller package. However, if we simply increase the price by $25\\%$, and then scale the package size down to 32 ounces from 48 ounces, these are the same calculations, but in a different order that makes it easier to calculate. Thus: $3.90 \\times 1.25 \\times \\frac{32}{48} = \\boxed{3.25\\text{ dollars}}$"
