At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Duck Creek, a bicycle license plate consists of one letter followed by one digit; for example, $Q7$ or $J1$. How many different license plates are possible?",

        "ground_truth": "There are 26 different letters in our alphabet, and there are 10 digits in our number system. Multiplying for the two different characters, we have $26 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{260}$ suitable license plates."
