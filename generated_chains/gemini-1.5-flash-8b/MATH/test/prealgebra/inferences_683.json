At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKailin's favorite restaurant has a special offer on a three-course meal. A meal consists of an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The menu features five appetizers, eight entrees and four desserts. How many different three-course meals can be formed with these choices?",
