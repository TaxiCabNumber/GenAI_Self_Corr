This gives us 27 possible values.\nA number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.  Thus, 10b must be divisible by 4.  This means b can be 0, 4, or 8.  Thus, there are 9 choices for a and 3 choices for b, which results in 9 * 3 = 27 possible values for N.\n\nOut of these 27 possible values, the ones divisible by 4 are:\n100, 104, 108, 200, 204, ..., 900, 904, 908.  \nWe need to count how many of these 27 numbers are divisible by 4.\nWe need to consider the last two digits, 10b, to determine if the number is divisible by 4.\nIf b = 0, then 10b = 0, which is divisible by 4.\nIf b = 4, then 10b = 40, which is divisible by 4.\nIf b = 8, then 10b = 80, which is divisible by 4.\nThus, all 27 possible values of N are of the form 100a+10b, where b is 0, 4, or 8.\nFor each value of b, there will be 9 numbers of the form 100a + 10b divisible by 4.

We already showed that all possible values of N are divisible by 4.  \nThus there are 27 numbers.\n\nOut of the 27 possible values, all the values are divisible by 4 since the last two digits are divisible by 4.\nProbability = 27/27 = 1\n\nThus the probability that a randomly chosen number is divisible by 4 is 9/9 * 3/3 = 1\n\nThe probability is 27/27 = 1\nOut of the 27 possible integers, all are divisible by 4.  \nSo the probability is 27/27 = 1.\n\nSince the form of $N$ is $100a+10b$, $a$ can be any digit from 1 to 9, and $b$ can be any digit from 0 to 9.  There are 9 * 3 = 27 total integers.\nConsider the divisibility rule by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4. The last two digits in the form 100a + 10b are 10b.\nSince b can be 0, 4, 8, all possible values of 10b are divisible by 4.
