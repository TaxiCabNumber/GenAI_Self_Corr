At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible area, in square centimeters, of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm?",
        "inference": "1. Case 1: The legs are 12 cm and 20 cm.\nThe area of a right triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  If the legs are 12 and 20, the area is (1/2) * 12 * 20 = 120 sq cm.\n\n2. Case 2: The hypotenuse is 12 cm.\nThe other two sides must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.  Let the other sides be x and y. Then x^2 + y^2 = 12^2 = 144.  We want to maximize the area, which is (1/2)xy. To maximize this, we would want x and y to be as close to each other as possible. If x = y, then 2x^2 = 144, x^2 = 72, x = sqrt(72) = 6sqrt(2).  The area is (1/2)(6sqrt(2))(6sqrt(2)) = 36.  However, the other side could be 12, in which case we'd have a degenerate triangle, so we have sides 12 and 12, and a right triangle of area 72.\n\n3. Case 3: The hypotenuse is 20 cm.\nThe other two sides must satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 20^2 = 400.  Again, to maximize the area (1/2)xy, we want x and y to be as close to each other as possible.  If x = y, then 2x^2 = 400, x^2 = 200, x = 10sqrt(2).  The area is (1/2)(10sqrt(2))(10sqrt(2)) = 100.\n4. Comparing the areas:\nCase 1: 120 sq cm\nCase 2: 72 sq cm\nCase 3: 100 sq cm\n\nThe largest area is 120 sq cm.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.\n\nIf the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.\n\nThe largest possible area then is $\\boxed{120}$ square centimeters."
