At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can I choose 4 different officers (President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary) from a club of 9 people?",
        "inference": "1. We need to choose a President from the 9 people. There are 9 choices.\n2. After choosing the President, we need to choose a Vice President from the remaining 8 people. There are 8 choices.\n3. After choosing the President and Vice President, we need to choose a Treasurer from the remaining 7 people. There are 7 choices.\n4. After choosing the President, Vice President, and Treasurer, we need to choose a Secretary from the remaining 6 people. There are 6 choices.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to choose the 4 officers, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n9 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 = 3024\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3024}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When choosing officers, order matters. The first position can be any of the 9 people. The second position can be any of the remaining 8 people, and so on. The answer is $9\\times 8\\times 7\\times 6=\\boxed{3024}$."
