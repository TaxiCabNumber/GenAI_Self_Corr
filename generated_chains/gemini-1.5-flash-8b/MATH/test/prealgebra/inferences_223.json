        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe radius of a circle is 2 inches. When the radius is doubled, by how many square inches is the area increased?  Express your  answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "1. Original radius: $r_1 = 2$ inches\n2. Original area: $A_1 = \\pi r_1^2 = \\pi (2^2) = 4\\pi$ square inches\n3. Doubled radius: $r_2 = 2r_1 = 2(2) = 4$ inches\n4. New area: $A_2 = \\pi r_2^2 = \\pi (4^2) = 16\\pi$ square inches\n5. Increase in area: $A_2 - A_1 = 16\\pi - 4\\pi = 12\\pi$ square inches\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12\\pi}$ inches. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the original circle is $\\pi \\cdot 2^2=4\\pi$ square inches. After doubling the radius to $2\\cdot2=4$ inches, the area increases to $\\pi \\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$ square inches. So the increase is $16\\pi-4\\pi=\\boxed{12\\pi}$ square inches."
