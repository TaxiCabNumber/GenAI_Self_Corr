At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the perimeter, in units, of a rhombus if its area is 120 square units and one diagonal is 10 units?",
        "inference": "1. The area of a rhombus is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * d1 * d2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n2. We are given that the area is 120 square units and one diagonal (d1) is 10 units.  Substituting these values into the formula: 120 = (1/2) * 10 * d2\n\n3. Solving for d2: 120 = 5 * d2  =>  d2 = 24 units\n\n4. Since a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, we can use the properties of a right triangle formed by half of each diagonal to find the side length.\n\n5. Let 's' be the side length of the rhombus.  Each diagonal bisects the other at a right angle.  So we have a right triangle with legs of length 5 (half of d1) and 12 (half of d2).\n\n6. Using the Pythagorean theorem: s^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169\n\n7. Taking the square root of both sides: s = 13 units\n\n8. The perimeter of a rhombus is 4 times the side length: Perimeter = 4 * s = 4 * 13 = 52 units\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, the legs of which are half-diagonals of the rhombus.
