        "inference": "To find the least positive four-digit multiple of 7, we need to find the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by 7.\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000.\nDividing 1000 by 7, we get:\n$1000 \\div 7 \\approx 142.857$\nThis means $142 \\times 7 = 994$. Since 994 is less than 1000, we need to find the next multiple of 7 that is greater than or equal to 1000.\n$143 \\times 7 = 1001$\nThus, the least positive four-digit multiple of 7 is 1001.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1001}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing 1000 by 7 gives a quotient of 142 and a remainder of 6. From this calculation we can see that $142\\cdot 7$ is the largest three-digit multiple of 7. Therefore, $143\\cdot 7=\\boxed{1001}$ is the least positive four-digit multiple of 7."
