        "inference": "1. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula $P = 4s$, where $P$ is the perimeter and $s$ is the side length.\n2. We are given that the perimeter is $28 \\text{ cm}$, so $28 = 4s$.\n3. Solving for $s$, we get $s = \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\text{ cm}$.\n4. The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $A$ is the area and $s$ is the side length.\n5. Substituting $s = 7 \\text{ cm}$ into the formula, we get $A = 7^2 = 49 \\text{ cm}^2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{49}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the four sides of a square are equal in length and the perimeter is $28,$ then each side has length $\\frac{28}{4}=7.$  The area of the square is the product of the length and width, which are each equal to $7.$ Therefore, the area of the square in $\\mbox{cm}^2$ is $7\\times7=\\boxed{49}.$"
