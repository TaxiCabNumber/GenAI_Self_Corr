        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a triangle have the same area. If the square has a side length of 6 units and the triangle has a base of 8 units, what is the length, in units, of the altitude to that base of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Area of square = side length * side length = 6 * 6 = 36 square units.\nArea of triangle = (1/2) * base * altitude.\nSince the areas are equal, 36 = (1/2) * 8 * altitude.\n36 = 4 * altitude.\naltitude = 36 / 4 = 9.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the square is $6^2=36$ square units, which is also the area of the triangle. Since the area of the triangle is half the product of the base and the height, the height of triangle is $36/8\\cdot2=\\boxed{9}$ units."
