        "inference": "The problem statement is unclear.  The sum of percentages greater than 100% is nonsensical for a score.  Assuming the percentages are not meant to be greater than 100, the question likely intends that they represent percentages out of 100.\n\nLet the five scores be $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, s_5$.\nThe known scores are 100%, 100%, 99%, 98%. Their sum is $100 + 100 + 99 + 98 = 397$.\nThe arithmetic mean of the five scores is 95%, so $\\frac{s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 + s_5}{5} = 95$.\nThis means the sum of all five scores is $5 \\times 95 = 475$.\n\nThe sum of the known scores is 397. Let $x$ be the score on the misplaced quiz.\nThen $x + 397 = 475$.\n$x = 475 - 397 = 78$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$",
