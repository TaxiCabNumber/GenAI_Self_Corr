        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are given by  \\[x=-\\frac{2}{3} \\qquad y=\\frac{5}{7} \\qquad z=-\\frac{11}{13}.\\]What is $\\frac{xy}{z}$?",
        "inference": "$\\frac{xy}{z} = \\frac{\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)}{-\\frac{11}{13}} = \\frac{-\\frac{10}{21}}{-\\frac{11}{13}} = \\frac{-10}{21} \\cdot \\frac{13}{-11} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 13}{21 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{130}{231}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{130}{231}}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since division by $z$ is the same as multiplication by $\\frac{1}{z}$, we are being asked to find \\[\nx\\cdot y \\cdot \\frac{1}{z}.\n\\]Since $z=-\\frac{11}{13}$, the reciprocal of $z$ is $\\frac{1}{z}=-\\frac{13}{11}$. So we get \\[\n\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{13}{11}\\right)=\\frac{2\\cdot5\\cdot13}{3\\cdot7\\cdot 11}=\\boxed{\\frac{130}{231}}.\n\\]The final answer is positive, because two of the three numbers being multiplied are negative (and a negative number times a negative number is a positive number)."
