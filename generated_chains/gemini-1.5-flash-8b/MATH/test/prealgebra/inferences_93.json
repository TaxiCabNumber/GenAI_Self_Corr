At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe data in the stem and leaf plot shown are the long jump distances, in centimeters, that the girls team of Pseudo H.S. made at practice today. $(51|1$ represents $511$ centimeters$.)$ What is the sum of the median and mode of the data?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|lllll}\n51& 1\\\\\n52&\\\\\n53& 2& 5\\\\\n54& 0& 2& 2& 5\\\\\n55& 0& 1& 3& 4& 7\\\\\n56& 0& 2& 5\\\\\n57& 0& 1\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",

Count the number of data points: There are 17 data points.\n\n3. Find the median: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 17 values, the median is the 9th value, which is 551.\n\n4. Find the mode: The mode is the most frequent value. The value 542 appears three times, which is more frequent than any other value. So the mode is 542.\n\n5. Calculate the sum of the median and mode: 551 + 542 = 1093.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1093}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
