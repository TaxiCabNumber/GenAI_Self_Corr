At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that they all come up heads?",
        "inference": "Each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).\nSince there are four coins, the total number of possible outcomes is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\nThe favorable outcome is that all four coins come up heads (HHHH).\nThus, there is only 1 favorable outcome.\nThe probability of all four coins coming up heads is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). There is only 1 way that they can all come up heads, so the probability of this is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16}}$."
