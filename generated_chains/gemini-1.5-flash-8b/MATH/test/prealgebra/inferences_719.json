At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe mean of four distinct positive integers is 5. If the largest of these four integers is 13, what is the smallest of the four integers?",
        "inference": "1. The mean of four numbers is their sum divided by 4.  So, the sum of the four integers is 4 * 5 = 20.\n2. The largest integer is 13.\n3. Let the other three integers be a, b, and c, where a < b < c < 13.\n4. The sum of the four integers is a + b + c + 13 = 20.\n5. Rearranging the equation: a + b + c = 20 - 13 = 7.\n6. Since a, b, and c are distinct positive integers, and they are smaller than 13, the largest possible value for c is 12. The smallest possible values for a, b, are 1.\n7. To get a sum of 7, with a < b < c, consider possible combinations. If c = 3, a = 1 and b = 3. The integers would be 1, 3, 3, 13 (not distinct)\n8. If c = 2, then a + b = 7 - 2 = 5. The possibilities for a and b are 1 and 4. Since a < b < c , a = 1, b = 4, c = 2 is not in order.  So this configuration is not correct.\n9. If c = 4, then a + b = 7 - 4 = 3. The only possible pair is 1 and 2, and the integers in order are a = 1, b = 2, c = 4.\n10. Thus, the four integers are 1, 2, 4, 13.\n11.
