        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $4x+5 = 6x+7$.",
        "inference": "1. Subtract $4x$ from both sides: $4x + 5 - 4x = 6x + 7 - 4x$, which simplifies to $5 = 2x + 7$.\n2. Subtract 7 from both sides: $5 - 7 = 2x + 7 - 7$, which simplifies to $-2 = 2x$.\n3. Divide both sides by 2: $\\frac{-2}{2} = \\frac{2x}{2}$, which simplifies to $-1 = x$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $4x$ from both sides, we get $5 = 2x+7$. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get $ -2 = 2x$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $ x = \\boxed{-1}$."
