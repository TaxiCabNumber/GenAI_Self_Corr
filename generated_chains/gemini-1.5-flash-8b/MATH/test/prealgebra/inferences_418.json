At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen more than five times a number equals five more than ten times the number. What is the number?",
        "inference": "Let the number be 'x'.\nFive times the number is 5x.\nTen more than five times the number is 5x + 10.\nTen times the number is 10x.\nFive more than ten times the number is 10x + 5.\nThe problem states that these two expressions are equal:\n5x + 10 = 10x + 5\nSubtract 5x from both sides:\n10 = 5x + 5\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n5 = 5x\nDivide both sides by 5:\nx = 1\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the number is $x$, then we have  $5x+10=10x+5$.  Subtracting 5 and $5x$ from both sides gives $5=5x$, so $x=\\boxed{1}$."
