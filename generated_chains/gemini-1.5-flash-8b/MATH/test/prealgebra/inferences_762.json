At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 3-letter sequences can be formed if the second letter must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), and the third letter must be different from the first letter?",
        "inference": "1. There are 5 choices for the second letter (a vowel).\n2. There are 26 choices for the first letter.\n3. There are 25 choices for the third letter (must be different from the first letter).\n4. The number of 3-letter sequences is the product of the number of choices for each position.\nTherefore, the total number of 3-letter sequences is 26 * 5 * 25 = 3250.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3250}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 26 options for the first letter, only 5 options for the second (vowels only), and 25 options for the third letter (all letters but the first letter).  This gives $26 \\times 5 \\times 25 = \\boxed{3,\\!250}$ combinations."
