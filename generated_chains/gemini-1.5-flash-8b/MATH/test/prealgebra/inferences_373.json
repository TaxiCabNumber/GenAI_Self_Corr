At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer divisible by the four smallest odd, positive integers?",
        "inference": "The four smallest odd positive integers are 1, 3, 5, and 7.\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.\nTo find the LCM, we find the prime factorization of each number.\n1 = 1\n3 = 3\n5 = 5\n7 = 7\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors that appear in the factorizations. In this case, the prime factors are 3, 5, and 7. The highest power of each prime factor is 1.\nLCM(1, 3, 5, 7) = 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 105\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{105}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The four smallest odd, positive integers are 1, 3, 5, and 7, so the integer must be divisible by 1, 3, 5, and 7. Since these four numbers share no factors other than 1, their least common multiple is $1\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7 = \\boxed{105}$."
