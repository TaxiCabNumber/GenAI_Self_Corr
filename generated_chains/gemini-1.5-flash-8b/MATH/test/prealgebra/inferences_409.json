Since x must be a positive integer, the possible values for x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n5. Counting the integers, there are 7 positive integer solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "First we divide by 3, writing the right side as a mixed number: \\[x-5\\leq2\\frac13.\\] If we add 5 to both sides we get  \\[x\\leq7\\frac13.\\] The positive integers solving this are $1,2,3,4,5,6,7$.  There are $\\boxed{7}$ integers on this list."
