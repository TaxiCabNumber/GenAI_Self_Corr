        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the shorter piece be $x$ cm.\nThe longer piece is five times the length of the shorter piece, so its length is $5x$ cm.\nThe total length of the yarn is $60$ cm.\nThe sum of the lengths of the two pieces is $x + 5x = 60$.\n$6x = 60$\n$x = \\frac{60}{6}$\n$x = 10$\nThe shorter piece is $10$ cm long.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the shorter piece has length $x$, then the longer piece has length $5x$. We require that $x + 5x = 6x = 60$.  Thus, $x = \\boxed{10}$ cm."
