At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBenjamin is trying to break a combination lock. This particular type of lock has 5 digits from 0 to 9, and Benjamin just happens to know that there can be no repeated digits in the code for this type of lock. How many valid codes are there?",
        "inference": "1. There are 10 possible digits (0-9) for the first digit.\n2. Since there are no repeated digits, there are 9 possible digits for the second digit.\n3. There are 8 possible digits for the third digit.\n4. There are 7 possible digits for the fourth digit.\n5. There are 6 possible digits for the fifth digit.\n6. To find the total number of valid codes, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit: 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 30240\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30240}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For his first digit, Benjamin has 10 possible choices. For his second digit, he has 9 possible choices, since he cannot repeat any digits. For his third, fourth, and fifth digits, he has 8, 7, and 6 possible choices. Therefore, there are $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{30,\\!240}$ possible codes."
