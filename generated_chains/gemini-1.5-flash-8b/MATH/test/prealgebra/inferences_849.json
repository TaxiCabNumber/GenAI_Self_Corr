We may add multiples of 9 to 2502 to obtain all the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600, and 90 is the greatest multiple of 9 we may add without exceeding 2600.  In other words, the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600 are the integers of the form $2502+9k$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 10.  There are $\\boxed{11}$ values of $k$ between 0 and 10 inclusive."
