At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA committee of three students met with the principal today and agreed that Rachel will report to the principal every $9$ days, Jessica every $12$ days, and Richard every $15$ days. What is the least number of days before all three will again report to the principal on the same day?",
        "inference": "To find the least number of days before all three students report to the principal on the same day again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three numbers: 9, 12, and 15.\n\nFirst, find the prime factorization of each number:\n$9 = 3^2$\n$12 = 2^2 \\times 3$\n$15 = 3 \\times 5$\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor present in the factorizations:\nLCM(9, 12, 15) = $2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of $9$, $12$, and $15$. Their prime factorizations are $9 = 3^2$, $12 = 2^2\\cdot 3$, and $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$. The prime factorization of the LCM must include all of these primes, raised to at least the highest power that they appear in any factorization.  Therefore, the LCM is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 180$, and the answer is $\\boxed{180}$ days."
