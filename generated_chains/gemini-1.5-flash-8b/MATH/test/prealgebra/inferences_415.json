At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for 15 cups of flour for 20 dozen cookies. How many cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find the number of cookies per cup of flour.\n20 dozen cookies = 20 * 12 cookies = 240 cookies\n15 cups of flour are needed for 240 cookies.\nSo, 1 cup of flour is needed for 240/15 = 16 cookies.\n2. Now we need to find the cups of flour needed for 144 cookies.\nSince 1 cup of flour is needed for 16 cookies,\n144 cookies / 16 cookies/cup = 9 cups of flour.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Converting 144 to 12 dozen, we see that we are making $\\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{3}{5}$ as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, we need $\\frac{3}{5}$ as much flour, which is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot15=\\boxed{9}$ cups."
