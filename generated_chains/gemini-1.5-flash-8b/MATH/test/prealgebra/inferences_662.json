I hope it is correct.'\nOne computer in a lab is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. Another computer is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. Find the number of times in twenty-four hours that the two computers back up data at the same time.\n\n(Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.)",
        "inference": "Let $t_1$ be the time in minutes when the first computer backs up data, and $t_2$ be the time in minutes when the second computer backs up data.\nThe first computer backs up data every 5 minutes, so $t_1 = 5k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\nThe second computer backs up data every 2 minutes, so $t_2 = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\nWe want to find the values of $k$ and $m$ such that $t_1 = t_2$.\nThus, $5k = 2m$.\nThis means that $5k$ is a multiple of 2 and 5.\nSo $k$ must be a multiple of 2. Let $k = 2n$ for some integer $n \\ge 1$.\nThen $5(2n) = 2m$, which simplifies to $10n = 2m$, or $5n = m$.\nThis means $t_1 = 5(2n) = 10n$ and $t_2 = 2(5n) = 10n$.\nSo the computers back up data at the same time at intervals of 10 minutes.\nWe need to find the number of times the computers back up data at the same time in 24 hours, which is 1440 minutes.\nThe first time is when $t_1 = t_2 = 10$ minutes.\nThe last time is when $t_1 = t_2 = 1430$ minutes.\nThe times when they back up at the same time are multiples of 10 minutes.\nThe possible times are $10, 20, 30, \\dots, 1430$.\nThis forms an arithmetic progression with first term $a_1 = 10$ and common difference $d = 10$.\nWe need to find the number of terms in the progression with the last term being $1430$.\nUsing the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we have $1430 = 10 + (n-1)10$.\n$1420 = (n-1)10$, so $142 = n-1$, and $n = 143$.\nSo there are 143 times in 24 hours when the two computers back up data at the same time.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{143}$",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the least common multiple of $5$ and $2$ so as to determine the intervals at which the computers back up together. Both $5$ and $2$ are prime, so the least common multiple is $10$. In one hour, there are $60/10=6$ ten minute intervals, so in $24$ hours, there are $6 \\cdot 24 = 144$ ten-minute intervals. Thus, the computers back up data at the same time $\\boxed{144}$ times."
