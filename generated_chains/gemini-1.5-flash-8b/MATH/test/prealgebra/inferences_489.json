        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJon teaches a fourth grade class at an elementary school where class sizes are always at least 20 students and at most 28.  One day Jon decides that he wants to arrange the students in their desks in a rectangular grid with no gaps.  Unfortunately for Jon he discovers that doing so could only result in one straight line of desks.  How many students does Jon have in his class?",
        "inference": "Possible rectangular arrangements of students are given by the pairs of factors of the number of students.  Since the class size is between 20 and 28, inclusive, the possible numbers of students are 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.  If the arrangement can only be a single row, the number of students must be a prime number.  Checking the given numbers, we see that 23 is the only prime number in the list.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{23}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the number of rows in the grid of students and let $n$ be the number of columns.  The total number of students is $mn$.  If the only way to express $mn$ as a product of positive integers is for one of the integers to be 1, then 1 and $mn$ are the only divisors of $mn$, so $mn$ is prime.  The number of students in Jon's class is $\\boxed{23}$, the only prime between 20 and 28."
