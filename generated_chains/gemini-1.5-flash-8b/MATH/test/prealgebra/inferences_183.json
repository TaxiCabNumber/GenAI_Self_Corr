At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the supplement of an angle measuring $50$ degrees?",
        "inference": "The supplement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the given angle, results in $180$ degrees.  Therefore, the supplement of a $50$-degree angle is $180 - 50 = 130$ degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{130}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Two supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Thus the supplement of 50 degrees is $180-50=\\boxed{130}$ degrees."
