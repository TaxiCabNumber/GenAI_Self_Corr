At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?",
        "inference": "1. Let the purchase price of the house be 'x'.\n2. Marika paid 80% of the purchase price with a loan, which means she paid 0.8x with a loan.\n3. The remaining amount she paid with her savings is $49,400.\n4. This remaining amount represents 100% - 80% = 20% of the purchase price.\n5. So, 0.2x = $49,400.\n6. To find the purchase price (x), divide both sides of the equation by 0.2:\n   x = $49,400 / 0.2\n7. x = $247,000\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$247,000}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$."
