        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a stack of eight quarters is exactly half an inch, how many quarters will be needed to make a stack one foot high?",
        "inference": "1 foot = 12 inches\nHalf an inch = 0.5 inches\n8 quarters = 0.5 inches\nNumber of stacks needed = 12 inches / 0.5 inches/stack = 24 stacks\nNumber of quarters = 24 stacks * 8 quarters/stack = 192 quarters\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{192}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
