At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo concentric circular regions have radii of 1 inch and 10 inches. What is the area, in square inches, outside the smaller region, but inside the larger region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
