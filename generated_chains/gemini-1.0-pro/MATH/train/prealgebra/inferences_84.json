At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) represent the shorter leg of the triangle. Then the longer leg has length \\(39 - x\\).\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, \n$$x^2 + (39 - x)^2 = 39^2$$\n$$x^2 + 1521 - 78x + x^2 = 1521$$\n$$2x^2 - 78x = 0$$\n$$2x(x - 39) = 0$$\n$$x = 0 \\quad or \\quad x = 39$$\nSince \\(x\\) is the length of a leg, \\(x\\) cannot be \\(0\\). So, \\(x = 39\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$39$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$."
