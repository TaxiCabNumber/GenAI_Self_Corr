If the second digit is 0, there are no integers because the first digit (1) is larger than the second. Similarly, if the second digit is 1, there are no integers. If the second digit is 2, there are 7 integers (with third digit from 3 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 3, there are 6 integers (with third digit from 4 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 4, there are 5 integers (with third digit from 5 to 9, inclusive). Among all the cases, there are $7+6+5=\\boxed{18}$ integers."
