        "inference": "Let $x$ be the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied by $400$, produces a product that is a multiple of $576$. Since $576=2^6\\cdot3^2$, the product $400x$ must be divisible by $2^6\\cdot3^2=192$. Since $400=2^4\\cdot5^2$, the product $400x$ is divisible by $2^6\\cdot5^2=160$.

Since the prime factorization of 576 has two more 2's and two more 3's than the prime factorization of 400, we know that the prime factorization of $x$ must include at least two 2's and at least two 3's.
