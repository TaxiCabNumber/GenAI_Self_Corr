At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stock investment went up $25\\%$ in 2006. Starting at this increased value, what percent would it have to go down in 2007 to be back to its original price at the beginning of 2006?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the original price be \\(x\\).\n\nIn 2006, the price went up by $25\\%$, so the new price is \\(1.25x\\).\n\nIn 2007, the price has to go down to \\(x\\), so the decrease is \\(1.25x - x = 0.25x\\)\n\nThe percent decrease is \\(\\frac{0.25x}{1.25x} \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{20}\\%\\)\n\n**Final Answer: $20$%. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the original price of the stock. This means that the price of the stock is $1.25x$ at the end of 2006. The original price is $\\frac{x}{1.25x} = 80$ percent of this price, so the stock must decrease by $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
