At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of irises to roses in Nikki's garden is 2:5. She currently has 25 roses. She is planning to add 20 more roses and enough irises to keep the same ratio. How many irises will she have in total after this addition?",
        "inference": "Let's think step by step.\nThe ratio of irises to roses is 2:5. This means that for every 2 irises, there are 5 roses.\nCurrently, Nikki has 25 roses. This means that she has 25/5 * 2 = 10 irises.\nShe is planning to add 20 more roses. This will give her a total of 25 + 20 = 45 roses.\nTo keep the same ratio, she needs to add 45/5 * 2 = 18 irises.\nShe will have a total of 10 + 18 = 28 irises after this addition.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.",
