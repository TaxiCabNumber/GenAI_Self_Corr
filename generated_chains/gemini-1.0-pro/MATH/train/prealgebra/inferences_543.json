        "ground_truth": "A.  Since $18=3\\cdot 6$, there is an integer $n$ such that $18=3\\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of factor, 3 is a factor of 18 and statement A is true.\n\nB.  We can list the divisors of 187.  They are 1, 11, 17, and 187.  Therefore, 17 is a divisor of 187.  We can also list the divisors of 52.  They are 1, 2, 4, 13, 26, and 52.  Therefore, 17 is not a divisor of 52 and statement B is true.\n\nC.  Since $72=24\\cdot 3$, there is an integer $n$ such that $72=24\\cdot n$.  Therefore, by definition of divisor, 24 is a divisor of 72 and statement C is false.\n\nD.  We already listed the divisors of 52 for statement B.  Since 13 was one of them, 13 is a divisor of 52, and statement D is false.\n\nE.  We can list the factors of 160.  They are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 32, 40, 80, and 160.  Therefore, 8 is a factor of 160, and statement E is true.\n\nTherefore, the statements that are true are $\\boxed{\\text{A,B,E}}$."
