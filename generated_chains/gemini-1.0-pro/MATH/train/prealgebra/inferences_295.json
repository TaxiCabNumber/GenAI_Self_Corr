At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo be eligible for an algebra class a student must have an average of at least $83\\%$ over all four quarters in his or her pre-algebra class. If Fisher had an $82\\%$, $77\\%$, and $75\\%$ in the first three quarters, what is the minimum score he must earn in the 4th quarter to move on to algebra?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet \\(x\\) be Fisher's score in the 4th quarter.\n\nThen, the average score over all 4 quarters is:\n\n$$\\frac{82 + 77 + 75 + x}{4} = \\frac{234 + x}{4}$$\n\nSince Fisher needs an average of at least 83%, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{234 + x}{4} \\ge 0.83$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n\n$$234 + x \\ge 332$$\n\nSubtracting 234 from both sides:\n\n$$x \\ge 98$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$98$}.

        "ground_truth": "To average $83\\%$ over four quarters, a student must earn a total of $4 \\times 83 = 332$ percentage points. So far Fisher has $82 + 77 + 75 = 234$ percentage points. He needs another $332 - 234 = 98$ percentage points, so he must earn a $\\boxed{98\\%}$ in the 4th quarter."
