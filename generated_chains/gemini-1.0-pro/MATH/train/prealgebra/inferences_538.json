At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct diagonals of a convex heptagon (7-sided polygon) can be drawn?",
        "inference": "A convex heptagon has 7 vertices. Each vertex can be connected to 5 other vertices to form a diagonal. However, we count each diagonal twice when we count it from both of its endpoints, so the actual number of diagonals is half of this.\n\n$$D = \\frac{7\\times 5}{2}$$\n\n$$D = \\frac{35}{2}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$D = 17.5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 4 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 7 vertices in a heptagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $7\\times 4 = 28$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{28}{2} = \\boxed{14}$ distinct diagonals in a convex heptagon."
