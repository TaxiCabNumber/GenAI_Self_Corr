        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a triangle have equal perimeters. The lengths of the three sides of the triangle are $6.1$ cm, $8.2$ cm and $9.7$ cm. What is the area of the square in square centimeters?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the side length of the square be $x$ cm.\n\nPerimeter of the square = $4x$ cm\n\nPerimeter of the triangle = $6.1 + 8.2 + 9.7 = 24$ cm\n\nSince the perimeters are equal, we have:\n\n$4x = 24$\n\n$x = 6$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is:\n\nArea of square = $x^2 = 6^2 = 36$ cm$^2$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{36}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of the triangle is $6.1+8.2+9.7=24$ cm. The perimeter of the square is also 24 cm. Each side of the square is $24\\div 4=6$ cm. The area of the square is $6^2=\\boxed{36}$ square centimeters."
