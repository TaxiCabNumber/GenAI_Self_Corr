At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe larger of two consecutive odd integers is three times the smaller.  What is their sum?",

        "ground_truth": "Let the smaller of the integers be $x$.  Then the larger is $x + 2$. So $x + 2 = 3x$, from which $x = 1$.  Thus the two integers are 1 and 3, and their sum is $\\boxed{4}$."
