        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward, for example 313 or 1001. Ignoring the colon, how many different palindromes are possible on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes? (Notice a zero may not be inserted before a time with a single-digit hour value. Therefore, 01:10 may not be used.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFor palindromes of the form $hh:mm$, there are $12$ choices for $h$ and $12$ choices for $m$. So, there are $12\\cdot 12 = 144$ possible palindromes of this form.\n\nFor palindromes of the form $h:hh$, there are $12$ choices for $h$. So, there are $12$ possible palindromes of this form.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $144+12 = 156$ possible palindromes on a 12-hour digital clock displaying only the hours and minutes.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{156}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, consider the three-digit palindromes.  There are $9$ choices for the first digit (the hour): $1$, $2$,..., $9$.  There are $6$ choices for the second digit (the tens digit of the minutes): $0$, $1$, ..., $5$.  The last digit (the units digit of the minutes) has to be the same as the first digit.  So there are $9 \\cdot 6 = 54$ three-digit palindromes.\n\nSecond, consider the four-digit palindromes.  The first digit (the tens digit of the hour) must be $1$.  There are $3$ choices for the second digit (the units digit of the hour): $0$, $1$, and $2$.  The third digit must be the same as the second digit, and the fourth digit must be the same as the first digit.  So there are $3$ four-digit palindromes.\n\nIn total, there are $54+3=\\boxed{57}$ different palindromes."
