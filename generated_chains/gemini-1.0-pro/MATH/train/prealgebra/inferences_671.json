At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRodney uses the following clues to try to guess a secret number:\n\\begin{tabular}{ c }\nIt is a two-digit integer.\\\\\nThe tens digit is odd.\\\\\nThe units digit is even.\\\\\nThe number is greater than 65.\n\\end{tabular}If Rodney guesses a number that has each of these properties, what is the probability that Rodney will guess the correct number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
