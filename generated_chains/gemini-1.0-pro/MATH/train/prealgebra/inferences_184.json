At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible median for the five number set        $\\{x, 2x, 3, 2, 5\\}$ if $x$ can be any integer?",
        "inference": "The median of a five number set is the middle value when the set is ordered from least to greatest. To find the largest possible median, we want to order the set so that the largest value is in the middle. \n\nTo do this, the largest value ($3x$) should be in the middle of the number set. \nTherefore, $2x$ and $x$ should be on the left side of $3x$, and $5$ and $2$ should be on the right side.\n\nSo, the largest possible median for the five number set $\\{x, 2x, 3, 2, 5\\}$ is $x$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The median is the number in the set with half the other numbers larger than it and half the others smaller. To maximize the median, we need to make $x$ as large as possible, so the items $x$ and $2x$ are as large as possible. Then, the median is $\\boxed{5}$, since 3 and 2 (half the other members) are smaller than it and $x$ and $2x$ are larger than it."
