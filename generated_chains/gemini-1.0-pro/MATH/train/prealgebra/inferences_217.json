        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average value of all the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in Paula's purse is 20 cents.  If she had one more quarter, the average value would be 21 cents.  How many dimes does she have in her purse?",
        "inference": "Let p be the number of pennies, n be the number of nickels, d be the number of dimes, and q be the number of quarters. We have the following information:\n\n$$\\frac{p+5n+10d+25q}{p+n+d+q} = 20$$\n\n$$\\frac{p+5n+10d+25(q+1)}{p+n+d+q+1} = 21$$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$$p+5n+10d+25q+25 = 21(p+n+d+q+1)$$\n\n$$p+5n+10d+25q+25 = 21p+21n+21d+21q+21$$\n\n$$20p-16n-11d-4q = -46$$\n\nDividing by 4, we get:\n\n$$5p-4n-\\frac{11}{4}d-q = -11.5$$\n\nMultiplying by 4, we get:\n\n$$20p-16n-11d-4q = -46$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$$-10n-\\frac{11}{4}d = -26.5$$\n\nMultiplying by -4, we get:\n\n$$40n+11d = 106$$\n\nSince n and d are integers, the only possible solution is n = 2 and d = 5.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the number of coins in Paula's purse, then their total value is $20n$ cents. If she had one more quarter, she would have $n+1$ coins whose total value in cents could be expressed both as $20n+25$ and as $21(n+1)$. Therefore \\[\n20n + 25 = 21 (n+1), \\quad \\text{so} \\quad n=4.\n\\]Since Paula has four coins with a total value of 80 cents, she must have three quarters and one nickel, so the number of dimes is $\\boxed{0}$."
