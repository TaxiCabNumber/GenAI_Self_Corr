Since there are $19$ data values, the middle value is the $10th$. The $10$th value is $38$. Therefore, the median is $38$.\n* The mode is the value that appears most often. In this case, the value $22$ appears $3$ times, which is most often. Therefore, the mode is $22$.\n* The positive difference between the median and the mode is $38 - 22 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}.$ I hope it is correct.",
