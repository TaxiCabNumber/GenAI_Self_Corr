        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest prime factor of 1821?",
        "inference": "1. Find the prime factors of 1821 by dividing by 2 repeatedly until the remainder is odd.\n2. 1821 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n3. 1821 is divisible by 3, since 1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3.\n4. 1821/3 = 607.\n5. 607 is prime, since it is only divisible by 1 and 607.\n6. Therefore, the smallest prime factor of 1821 is 3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "1821 is clearly not even, so 2 is not a factor. We find that 3 is a factor, since the sum of the digits of 1821 is $1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12$, which is divisible by 3. Since we want the smallest prime factor, we are done; our answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
