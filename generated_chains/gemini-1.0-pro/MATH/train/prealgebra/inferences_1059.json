At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of different colors?",
        "inference": "There are 4 ways to choose a white sock.  There are 4 ways to choose a brown sock.  However, there are 2 ways to choose the order in which they are chosen, so we need to divide by 2 to account for the order.  There are 2 ways to choose a blue sock.  However, there are 2 ways to choose the order in which they are chosen, so we need to divide by 2 to account for the order.  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose a pair of socks of different colors is $4 \\times 4 \\div 2 + 4 \\times 2 \\div 2 = 8 + 4 = 12$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the socks are different, either white and brown, brown and blue, or white and blue can be picked.  If the socks are white and brown, there are 4 options for the white sock and 4 options for the brown sock for a total of 16 choices.  If the socks are brown and blue, there are 4 options for the brown sock and 2 options for the blue sock for a total of 8 choices.  If the socks are white and blue, there are 4 options for the white sock and 2 options for the brown sock for a total of 8 choices.  This gives a total of $16 + 8 + 8 = \\boxed{32}$ choices."
