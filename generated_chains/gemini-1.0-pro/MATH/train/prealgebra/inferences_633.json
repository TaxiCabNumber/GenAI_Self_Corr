At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe stem and leaf plot represents the heights, in inches, of the players on the Spring Vale Middle School girls' basketball team. What is the mean height of the players on the team?
