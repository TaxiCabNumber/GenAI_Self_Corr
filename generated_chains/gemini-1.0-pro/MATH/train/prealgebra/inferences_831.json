At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWrite $0.\\overline{43}$ as a simplified fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{43} = 0.434343...$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 43.\\overline{43}$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $99x = 43$, so $x = \\frac{43}{99} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

Subtracting the left-hand sides $100a$ and $a$, and subtracting the right-hand sides $43.\\overline{43}$ and $0.\\overline{43}$ yields \\begin{align*} 100a- a &= 43.\\overline{43}- 0.\\overline{43}\\\\ \\Rightarrow 99a &= 43\\\\ \\Rightarrow a &= \\boxed{\\frac{43}{99}}. \\end{align*}"
