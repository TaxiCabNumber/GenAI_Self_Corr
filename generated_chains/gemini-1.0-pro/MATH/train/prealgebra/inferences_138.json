        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJaclyn, Marcelle, Susanna and Wanda are tutors in their school math lab. Their schedule is as follows: Jaclyn works every third school day, Marcelle works every fourth school day, Susanna works every sixth school day, and Wanda works every seventh school day. Today, they are all working in the math lab. In how many school days from today will they next be together tutoring in the lab?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the number of school days from today until they are next together tutoring in the lab.\n\nSince Jaclyn works every third school day, she will work again in $3x$ days.\nSince Marcelle works every fourth school day, she will work again in $4x$ days.\nSince Susanna works every sixth school day, she will work again in $6x$ days.\nSince Wanda works every seventh school day, she will work again in $7x$ days.\n\nSince they are all working together today, we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n3x&=4y\\\\\n3x&=6z\\\\\n3x&=7w\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{4}{3}y$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get $3\\left(\\frac{4}{3}y\\right)=6z$, which simplifies to $y=2z$.\nSubstituting this into the third equation, we get $3\\left(\\frac{4}{3}y\\right)=7w$, which simplifies to $y=7/3w$.\n\nSince $y=2z$ and $y=7/3w$, we have $2z=7/3w$.\nSolving this equation for $z$, we get $z=\\frac{7}{6}w$.\n\nSubstituting this into $x=\\frac{4}{3}y$, we get $x=\\frac{4}{3}(2z)=\\frac{8}{3}z$.\nFinally, substituting this into $x=\\frac{4}{3}y$, we get $x=\\frac{4}{3}(7/3w)=\\frac{28}{9}w$.\n\nTherefore, the next time they will all be tutoring together is in $\\boxed{84}$ school days from today.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$84$}.
