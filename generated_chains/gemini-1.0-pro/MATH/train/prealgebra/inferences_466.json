At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nVanessa set a school record for most points in a single basketball game when her team scored $48$ points. The six other players on her team averaged $3.5$ points each. How many points did Vanessa score to set her school record?",

Subtract the total points scored by the other players from the total team score:\n- $48 - 21 = 27$\n\n3. Vanessa's score is the remaining points:\n- $27$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct.",
