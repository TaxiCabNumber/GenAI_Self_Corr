At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sign painter paints individual numerals for a row of 50 houses. The houses are numbered with consecutive integers from 1 to 50. How many 9s are painted?",
        "inference": "There are two 9s in each of the numbers 19 and 29, and one 9 in each of the numbers 9, 39, and 49. So, there must be  $2\\times2+1\\times3=7$ 9s painted.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For every ten consecutive integers 1-10, 11-20, and so on until 50, there is one 9 painted. Since there are 5 sets of ten consecutive integers, there are $\\boxed{5}$ nines painted."
