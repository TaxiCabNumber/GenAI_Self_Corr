To round this number to the nearest hundredth, we look at the digit in the hundredths place, which is $4$.  Since $4$ is less than $5$, we round down.  Therefore, $54.\\overline{54}$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{54.54}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54.54}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To round $54.\\overline{54}$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. We write it as \\[54.\\overline{54} = 54.5454\\overline{54}.\\]Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $4$ rounds up to $5$. Therefore, $54.\\overline{54}$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{54.55}$."
