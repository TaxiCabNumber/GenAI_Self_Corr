At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam and Simon start on bicycle trips from the same point at the same time. Adam travels east at 8mph and Simon travels south at 6mph. After how many hours are they 60 miles apart?",
        "inference": "To determine the distance between Adam and Simon, we need to consider the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the distance between their starting point and where they meet) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the distances they travel).\n\nStep 1: Determine how far each person travels in hours.\nAdam travels 8 mph, so after \"t\" hours, he will have traveled 8t miles.\nSimon travels 6 mph, so after \"t\" hours, he will have traveled 6t miles.\n\nStep 2: Set up an equation based on the Pythagorean theorem.\nThe distance between Adam and Simon is given by the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by their paths. Therefore, the equation is:\n(Distance between Adam and Simon)^2 = (Distance Adam travels)^2 + (Distance Simon travels)^2\n\nStep 3: Substitute the expressions from Step 1 into the equation.\n(Distance between Adam and Simon)^2 = (8t)^2 + (6t)^2\n\nStep 4: Simplify and solve for t.\n(Distance between Adam and Simon)^2 = 64t^2 + 36t^2\n(Distance between Adam and Simon)^2 = 100t^2\nDistance between Adam and Simon = 10t\n\nStep 5: Set the distance between Adam and Simon to 60 miles and solve for t.\n10t = 60\nt = 6\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}.

        "ground_truth": "If Adam travels east and Simon travels south, then their paths are perpendicular and their distance apart is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Let $x$ be the number of hours it takes for Adam and Simon to be $60$ miles apart. Then Adam has traveled $8x$ miles and Simon has traveled $6x$ miles. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(8x)^2+(6x)^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n\\sqrt{100x^2}&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n10x&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6.\n\\end{align*}They are $60$ miles apart after $\\boxed{6}$ hours."
