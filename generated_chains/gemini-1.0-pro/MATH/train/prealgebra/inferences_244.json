At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of measures of two complementary angles is 4 to 5. The smallest measure is increased by $10\\%$. By what percent must the larger measure be decreased so that the two angles remain complementary?",
        "inference": "Let the measures of the two complementary angles be 4x and 5x, in degrees.\n\nThe sum of the two angles is 90 degrees, so we have:\n\n4x + 5x = 90\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 90 / (4 + 5) = 10\n\nSo the two angles are 40 degrees and 50 degrees.\n\nThe smaller angle is increased by 10%, so the new measure is 40 * 1.10 = 44 degrees.\n\nThe two angles are now 44 degrees and 50 degrees.\n\nTo find the percent that the larger angle must be decreased by, we need to find the difference between the new sum of the angles and 90 degrees, and then divide that difference by the new larger angle.\n\n90 - (44 + 50) = 90 - 94 = -4\n\n(-4) / 50 * 100 = -8%\n\n**Final Answer: -8%. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the ratio of the two complementary angles is 4 to 5, then there are 9 equal parts making up the full 90 degrees. That means each part is 10 degrees, and the two angles are 40 degrees and 50 degrees. When the 40-degree angle is increased by $10\\%$, we get 44 degrees. The 50-degree angle must drop down to 46 so that the two angles remain complementary. Dividing 46 by 50, we get 0.92, or $92\\%$. The larger angle must decrease by $\\boxed{8\\%}$."
