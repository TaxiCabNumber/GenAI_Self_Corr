At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree measure of an interior angle of a regular pentagon?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon with n sides is (n - 2) * 180 degrees.  Since a pentagon has 5 sides, we have\n\n$$(5 - 2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540$$\n\ndegrees.  Since each of the five interior angles is congruent, each interior angle has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{540}{5} = \\boxed{108}$$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{108}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Any convex pentagon may be subdivided into three triangles, each with a total angle sum of 180 degrees. Thus, the sum of the interior angles of any convex pentagon is $3 \\times 180 = 540$ degrees. If the pentagon is regular, then each of its five angles will have the same measure of $540 \\div 5 = \\boxed{108\\text{ degrees}}$."
