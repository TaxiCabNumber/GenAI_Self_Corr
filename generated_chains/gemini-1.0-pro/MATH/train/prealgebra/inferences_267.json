        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJar A has exactly four red buttons and eight blue buttons.  Carla then removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from Jar A and places them in an empty Jar B.  Jar A now has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of its original number of buttons.  If Carla were now to randomly choose a button from Jar A and a button from Jar B, what is the probability that the two chosen buttons will both be red?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Jar A started with four red buttons and eight blue buttons, a total of $4+8=12$ buttons, so it lost $12\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=4$ buttons (of each color).  Jar A then has $4-4=0$ red buttons and $8-4=4$ blue buttons remaining, for a total of $0+4=4$ buttons left in Jar A.  Jar B then has $4$ red buttons and $4$ blue buttons, for a total of $4+4=8$ buttons.  Thus the probability of drawing a red button from Jar A is $0/4=0$, and the probability of drawing a red button from Jar B is $4/8=1/2$.  Since these events are independent, the probability of drawing two red buttons is $0\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two-thirds of Jar A's original $4+8=12$ buttons is 8 buttons.  Therefore, four buttons were removed from Jar A: two red buttons and two blue buttons.  So the probability that the button drawn from Jar A is red is $\\frac{2}{8}$ and the probability that the button drawn from Jar B is red is $\\frac{2}{4}$.  Therefore, the probability that both buttons are red is $\\dfrac{2}{8}\\cdot\\dfrac{2}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
