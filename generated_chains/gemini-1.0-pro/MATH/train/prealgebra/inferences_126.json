Thus, $\\text{LCM}(125, 30)=2\\cdot3\\cdot5^3= 750$. $n$ is then some multiple of 750. Since $n$ is between 800 and 2000, $n=750$ is too small. Thus, we try $n=2 \\cdot 750=1500$. This number could be John's number. Notice that $n=3 \\cdot 750=2250$ is too large. Thus, John's number is $\\boxed{1500}$."
