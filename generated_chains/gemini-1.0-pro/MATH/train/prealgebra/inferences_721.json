        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\textrm{A}$ be a digit. If the 7-digit number $353808\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, then what is $\\textrm{A}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution of the problem**:\n\n**Step 1**: A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. The last digit of $353808\\textrm{A}$ is $\\textrm{A}$, so $\\textrm{A}$ must be even. Therefore, $\\textrm{A}$ can be either 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\n**Step 2**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ is $3 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 0 + 8 + \\textrm{A}$. Since $\\textrm{A}$ is even, the sum of the digits is odd. Therefore, $353808\\textrm{A}$ is not divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 3**: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. The last two digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ are $0\\textrm{A}$. Since $\\textrm{A}$ is even, the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Therefore, $353808\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 4.\n\n**Step 4**: A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since $353808\\textrm{A}$ ends in $\\textrm{A}$, it is not divisible by 5.\n\n**Step 5**: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Since $353808\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 2 but not by 3, it is not divisible by 6.\n\n**Step 6**: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. The last three digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ are $08\\textrm{A}$. Since $\\textrm{A}$ is even, the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. Therefore, $353808\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 8.\n\n**Step 7**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of $353808\\textrm{A}$ is $3 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 0 + 8 + \\textrm{A}$. Since $\\textrm{A}$ is even, the sum of the digits is odd. Therefore, $353808\\textrm{A}$ is not divisible by 9.\n\n**Step 8**: Therefore, the only digit that satisfies all of the conditions is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For the number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be a 5 or a 0. In addition, for the number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be even. Thus, $\\textrm{A}$ must be $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNote that when $\\textrm{A}=0$, we also have the following:\n\n* The sum of the digits of the number is 27, so the number is divisible by 3 and 9.   * The number formed by the last two digits is 80, which is a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by 4.\n\n* The number is divisible by 2 and by 3, so it is divisible by 6.\n\n* The number formed by the last three digits is 080, which is a multiple of 8, so the number is divisible by 8."
