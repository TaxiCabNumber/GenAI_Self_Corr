At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area of the gray region, in square units, if the radius of the larger circle is four times the radius of the smaller circle and the diameter of the smaller circle is 2 units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.

        "inference": "The area of the gray region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle. The radius of the larger circle is 4 times the radius of the smaller circle, so the area of the larger circle is 16 times the area of the smaller circle. The diameter of the smaller circle is 2 units, so the radius of the smaller circle is 1 unit. Therefore, the area of the smaller circle is $\\pi$ square units. The area of the larger circle is $16\\pi$ square units. Therefore, the area of the gray region is $16\\pi - \\pi = 15\\pi$ square units.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the diameter of the small circle is 2, then the radius is 1. Thus, the radius of the large circle is 4 times this, or 4. The area of the large circle is then $\\pi4^2=16\\pi$ and the area of the small circle is $\\pi 1^2=1\\pi$. We can then find the gray area to be the difference in these, or $16\\pi-1\\pi=\\boxed{15\\pi} \\text{sq units}$."
