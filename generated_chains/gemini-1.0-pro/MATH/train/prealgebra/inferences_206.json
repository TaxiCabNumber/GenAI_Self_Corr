At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a particular square and the circumference of a particular circle are equal. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the side length of the square. Then the perimeter of the square is $4x$.\n\nThe circumference of the circle is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the circumference of the circle, we have $4x=2\\pi r$. Solving for $r$, we get $r=\\frac{2x}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe area of the square is $x^2$. The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2=\\pi \\left ( \\frac{2x}{\\pi} \\right )^2 = \\frac{4x^2}{\\pi}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{x^2}{\\frac{4x^2}{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.
