At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe grade received on a certain teacher's 100-point test varies in direct proportion to the amount of time a student spends preparing for the test. If a student receives 72 points on a test for which she spent 3 hours preparing, what score would she receive on the next test if she spent 4 hours preparing?",
        "inference": "Let x be the test score. Since the grade received on a certain teacher's 100-point test varies in direct proportion to the amount of time a student spends preparing for the test, \n\n$$\\frac{x}{4}=\\frac{72}{3}.$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$$x=\\frac{72\\cdot4}{3}=\\boxed{96}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{96}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the grade received varies directly with the time a student spends preparing, we know that the ratio of grade:time spent preparing is always constant. Thus, if we let $x$ be the score the student gets when she prepares for $4$ hours, we have that $$\\frac{72 \\text{ points}}{3 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{x}{4 \\text{ hours}}.$$  Solving this equation for $x$, we have that $x = \\frac{(72 \\text{ points})(4 \\text{ hours})}{3 \\text{ hours}} = \\boxed{96}$ points."
