At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $a$ is a multiple of $3$ and $b$ is a multiple of $6$. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. $b$ is a multiple of $3$.\nB. $a-b$ is a multiple of $3$.\nC. $a-b$ is  a multiple of $6$.\nD. $a-b$ is  a multiple of $2$.\n\nList the choices in your answer separated by commas.  For example, if you think they are all true, then answer \"A,B,C,D\".",
        "inference": "Since $a$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $a = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Also, since $b$ is a multiple of $6$, we can write $b = 6m$ for some integer $m$. Therefore,\n\n$$a - b = 3k - 6m = 3(k - 2m)$$\n\nSince $k$ and $m$ are integers, $k - 2m$ is also an integer. Therefore, $a - b$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{A}.

        "ground_truth": "A. Recall that if $x$ is a multiple of $y$, and $y$ is a multiple of $z$, then $x$ is a multiple of  $z$. Because $b$ is a multiple of  $6$ and $6$ is a multiple of  $3$, then $b$ must be a multiple of $3$.\n\nB. Recall that the difference between two multiples of $w$ is also a multiple of $w$. Thus, because $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of  $3$ (using the information from statement 1), their difference is also a multiple of $3$.\n\nC. We do not know if $a$ is a multiple of  $6$. For example, $12$ is a multiple of  both $3$ and $6$, but $9$ is a multiple of  $3$ and not $6$. Thus, we cannot use the property that the difference between two multiples of $w$ is a multiple of $w$. We don't know if this statement is true.\n\nD. We know that $b$ is a multiple of  $6$, and $6$ is a multiple of  $2$, so $b$ is a multiple of  $2$. However, just as in statement 3, we do not know if $a$ is a multiple of  $2$. We also don't know if this statement is true.\n\nStatements $\\boxed{\\text{A, B}}$ must be true."
