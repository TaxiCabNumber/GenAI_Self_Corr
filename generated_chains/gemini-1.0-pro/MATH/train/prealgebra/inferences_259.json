Since each angle in the given polygon measures $140^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $140n$.  Therefore, we must have  \\[180(n-2) = 140n.\\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 140n$, so $40n = 360$ and $n = \\boxed{9}$.\n\nWe might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\\circ - 140^\\circ = 40^\\circ$.
