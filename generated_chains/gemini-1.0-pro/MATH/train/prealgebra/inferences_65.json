At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJeremy's friend Steven will pay him $\\dfrac{11}{2}$ dollars for every room he cleans. Yesterday, Jeremy cleaned $\\dfrac{7}{3}$ rooms. How many dollars does Steven owe Jeremy? Leave your answer in fraction form.",
