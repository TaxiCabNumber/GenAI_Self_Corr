        "inference": "First, we find the cost of one dozen apples:\n$$Cost\\space of\\space one\\space dozen\\space apples = $$15.60/2 = $7.80$$\n\nNow, we find the cost of three dozen apples:\n$$Cost\\space of\\space three\\space dozen\\space apples = 3 * $7.80 = $23.40$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$23.40}.

        "ground_truth": "Three dozen cost 1.5 times as much as two dozen, so the cost is $\\frac32\\cdot\\$15.60=3\\cdot\\$7.80=\\boxed{\\$23.40}$."
