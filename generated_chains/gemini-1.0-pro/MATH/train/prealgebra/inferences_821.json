At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square has a diagonal of length $10\\sqrt{2}$ centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the square?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nLet $a$ be the length of a side of the square. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n\n$$a^2+a^2=(10\\sqrt{2})^2=200.$$\n\nTherefore, $a^2=100$ and $a=10$.\n\nThus, the area of the square is $a^2=(10)^2=100$ square centimeters.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "A diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles, so the side length of the square is $10\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=10$ centimeters and its area is $10^2=\\boxed{100}$ square centimeters"
