        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when the sum of the first five primes is divided by the sixth prime?",
        "inference": "The first five primes are $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $11$. Their sum is $2+3+5+7+11=28$. The sixth prime is $13$. Therefore, the remainder when $28$ is divided by $13$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the first five primes is $2+3+5+7+11=28$. Divide the sum by the next prime, 13, to get $28\\div13=2R2$. Thus the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$."
