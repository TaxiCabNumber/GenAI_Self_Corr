At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
        "inference": "Let x be the probability of earning a B. Then, the probability of earning an A is 0.7x and the probability of earning a C is 1.4x.\n\nSince all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of these probabilities must be 1:\n\n0.7x + x + 1.4x = 1\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3.1x = 1\n\nDividing both sides by 3.1, we find:\n\nx = 1/3.1\n\nTherefore, the probability of earning a B is 1/3.1.\n\nTo find the number of B's in a class of 31 students, we multiply the probability of earning a B by the number of students:\n\nNumber of B's = (1/3.1) * 31\n\nNumber of B's = 10\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$."
