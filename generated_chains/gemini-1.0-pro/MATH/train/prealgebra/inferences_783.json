        "inference": "The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is the sum of the length of all three of its sides. Since this is an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. So we just need to find the length of one side and multiply by $3$. Since the base of the triangle is $8$m, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of one side, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the base and the height of the triangle. The height of the triangle is $4\\sqrt{3}$m, so the length of one side is \n\n$$\\sqrt{8^2+(4\\sqrt{3})^2}=\\sqrt{64+48}=\\sqrt{112}=4\\sqrt{7}\\text{m}.$$\n\nSo the perimeter of the triangle is \n\n$$3\\cdot4\\sqrt{7}=12\\sqrt{7}\\text{m}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12\\sqrt{7}}.
