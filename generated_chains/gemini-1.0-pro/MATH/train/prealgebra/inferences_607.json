        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of degrees the hour hand moves in one hour.\nThere are 12 hours on a clock, so the hour hand moves 360 degrees / 12 hours = 30 degrees per hour.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of degrees the hour hand has moved since 12 pm.\nThe hour hand has moved 25 minutes since 12 pm, which is 25/60 = 5/12 of an hour. So the hour hand has moved 30 degrees * 5/12 = 12.5 degrees.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the total number of degrees the minute hand moves in one hour.\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so the minute hand moves 360 degrees / 60 minutes = 6 degrees per minute.\n\n**Step 4:** Find the number of degrees the minute hand has moved since 12 pm.\nThe minute hand has moved 25 minutes since 12 pm, so the minute hand has moved 6 degrees * 25 = 150 degrees.\n\n**Step 5:** Find the difference between the degrees moved by the hour hand and the degrees moved by the minute hand.\n150 degrees - 12.5 degrees = 137.5 degrees.\n\n**Step 6:** The smaller angle is half of the difference between the degrees moved by the hour hand and the degrees moved by the minute hand.\n137.5 degrees / 2 = 68.75 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$68.8$}.
