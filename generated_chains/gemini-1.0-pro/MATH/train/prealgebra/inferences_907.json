At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive perfect square that is divisible by both 2 and 3?",
        "inference": "A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. The smallest perfect square is 1, which is the square of 1.\nA number is divisible by 2 if it is even. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\nThe smallest even perfect square is 4, which is the square of 2. The smallest perfect square whose sum of digits is divisible by 3 is 9, which is the square of 3.\nThe smallest perfect square that is divisible by both 2 and 3 is the least common multiple of 4 and 9, which is 36.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Squaring the first few positive integers, we find that the first few perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, and 64. First we strike off the ones that are not even, leaving us with 4, 16, 36, and 64. Four is not divisible by 3, and 16 is not divisible by 3 since the sum of its digits, $1+6=7$, is not divisible by 3. However, the sum of the digits of 36 is $3+6=9$, so 36 is divisible by 3. Thus $\\boxed{36}$ is the least perfect square divisible by both 2 and 3."
