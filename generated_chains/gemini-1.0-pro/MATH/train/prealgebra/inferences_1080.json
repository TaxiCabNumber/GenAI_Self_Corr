At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree of the following test scores are Cyprian's and the other three are Margaret's: 85, 87, 92, 93, 94, 98. Cyprian's mean score is 90. What is Margaret's mean score?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be Margaret's mean score. Then, \\(90\\) is Cyprian's mean score.\n\nSince mean is sum of all values divided by the number of values, we have\n$$85 + 87 + 92 + x + x + x = 90 \\times 3 + x \\times 3$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 264 + 3x = 270 + 3x$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3x = 6$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x = 2$$\n\nTherefore, Margaret's mean score is 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of all six scores is $549$.  The sum of Cyprian's scores is $3(90)=270$, so the sum of Margaret's scores is $549-270=279$.  Thus the average of her scores is $\\frac{279}{3}=\\boxed{93}$."
