At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand of a 12-hour clock at 6:48?",
        "inference": "**1.** The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves 360 / 12 = 30 degrees per hour.\n\n**2.** The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 360 / 60 = 6 degrees per minute.\n\n**3.** At 6:48, the hour hand has moved 6 * 30 = 180 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\n**4.** The minute hand has moved 48 * 6 = 288 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\n**5.** The angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the difference between their positions, which is 288 - 180 = 108 degrees.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$108^\\circ$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "At 6:48, the minute hand is $\\frac{12}{60}(360^\\circ)=72$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The hour hand is $\\frac{5\\frac{12}{60}}{12}(360^\\circ)=156$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The difference in the two positions is $156^\\circ-72^\\circ=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
