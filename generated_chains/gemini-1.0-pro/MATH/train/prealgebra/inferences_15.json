I hope it is correct.'\nThe median of the set of numbers $\\{$12, 38, 45, $x$, 14$\\}$ is five less than the mean. If $x$ is a negative integer, what is the value of $x$?",

The mean is five less than the median, so 21.8 = 14 + 5.\n\n\n4. Therefore, $x$ = 21.8 - 14 - 5 = 2.8.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
