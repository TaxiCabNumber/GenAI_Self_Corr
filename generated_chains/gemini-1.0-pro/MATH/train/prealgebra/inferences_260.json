At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Find the number of natural numbers between 153 and 297 divisible by 9.\nTo do this, we can find the difference between 297 and 153 and divide it by 9.\n297 - 153 = 144\n144 \u00f7 9 = 16\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{16}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $9$. Thus, the least and greatest numbers in the range from $150$ to $300$ that are divisible by nine are $153$ and $297$.  So, we must count the numbers in the list  \\[9\\cdot 17, 9\\cdot 18, 9\\cdot 19, \\ldots, 9\\cdot 33.\\] This list has the same number of numbers as the list \\[17, 18, 19,\\ldots, 33.\\] Subtracting 16 from each of these gives  \\[1,2,3,\\ldots,17.\\] There are clearly $\\boxed{17}$ numbers in this list."
