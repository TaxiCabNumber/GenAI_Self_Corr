        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find Marguerite's average speed.\nAverage speed = Distance/Time = 100 miles/2.4 hours = 41.67 miles per hour\n\n**Step 2:** Use Marguerite's average speed to find Sam's distance.\nDistance = Average speed x Time = 41.67 miles per hour x 3 hours = 125 miles\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{125}. I hope it is correct.**",
