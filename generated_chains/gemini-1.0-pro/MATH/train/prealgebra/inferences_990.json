        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?",
        "inference": "Each team plays 5 games within its division and 6 games outside its division. So each team plays 11 conference games. \n\nSince there are 12 teams, the total number of conference games is 12 x 11 = 132.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{132}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
