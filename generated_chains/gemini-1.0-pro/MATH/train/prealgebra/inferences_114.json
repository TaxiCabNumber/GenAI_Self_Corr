At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of four numbers is one-half. What is the mean of the four numbers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet's represent the four numbers as $a, b, c$, and $d$. \nWe know that $a + b + c + d = \\frac{1}{2}$. \nThe mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. So, the mean of the four numbers is: \n$$\\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}.$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the mean of four numbers is just their sum divided by four, the mean is $\\dfrac{1/2}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
