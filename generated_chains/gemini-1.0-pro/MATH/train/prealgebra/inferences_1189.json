At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the 36 students in Richelle's class, 12 prefer chocolate pie, 8 prefer apple, and 6 prefer blueberry.  Half of the remaining students prefer cherry pie and half prefer lemon.  For Richelle's pie graph showing this data, how many degrees should she use for cherry pie?",
        "inference": "1) 12 prefer chocolate pie, 8 prefer apple, and 6 prefer blueberry.  So, 12 + 8 + 6 = 26 students prefer these three flavors.\n\n2) 36 - 26 = 10 students prefer the remaining flavors.\n\n3) Half of the remaining students prefer cherry pie, and half prefer lemon.  So, 10 / 2 = 5 students prefer cherry pie.\n\n4) To find the number of degrees for cherry pie, we need to divide the number of students who prefer cherry pie by the total number of students and multiply by 360 degrees.\n\n5) 5 / 36 * 360 = 50 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{50}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $12 + 8 + 6 = 26$, there are $36-26= 10$ children who prefer cherry or lemon pie.  These ten are divided into equal parts of 5 each.\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\times 360^{\\circ} = 5 \\times 10^{\\circ} = \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}. \\]"
