        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least four-digit positive integer, with all different digits, that is divisible by each of its digits?",
        "inference": "The smallest four-digit positive integer with all different digits is 1023.\n\n1023 is divisible by 1, 3, and 2.\n\nTo check if it is divisible by 0, we divide the sum of its digits by 9.\n\n1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 6\n\n6 is divisible by 3, but not by 9.\n\nTherefore, 1023 is not divisible by 0.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{1023}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the problem asks for the least possible number, you should start with the lowest number ($0$) and work your way up (and across the number.) Nothing is divisible by zero, so zero cannot be one of the digits in the four-digit number. Every whole number is divisible by $1$, so the digit $1$ should be in the thousands place to create the smallest number. The digits must be different, so put a $2$ in the hundreds place. Now, you have to make sure the number is even. You can put a $3$ in the tens place, but you cannot use $4$ for the ones place since $1234$ is not divisible by $3$ or $4$. $1235$ is not even, so it is not divisible by $2$ (or for that matter, by $3$). $\\boxed{1236}$ is divisible by all of its own digits."
