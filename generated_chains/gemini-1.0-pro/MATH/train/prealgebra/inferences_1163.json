        "ground_truth": "$20\\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .2, and $10\\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .1.  Since a percent of a percent is simply multiplying two decimals, it does not matter what order we take the percentages - it will be the same result.  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
