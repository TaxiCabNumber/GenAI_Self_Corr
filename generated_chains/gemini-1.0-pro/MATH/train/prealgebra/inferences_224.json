At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPaint is to be mixed so that the ratio of red paint to white paint is 3 to 2. If Ben wants to make 30 cans of the mixture and all cans hold the same volume of paint, how many cans of red paint will he need?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the ratio of red paint to white paint is 3:2.\n\nTotal ratio = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nRed paint ratio = 3/5\n\nFor 30 cans, the amount of red paint needed = 3/5 x 30 = 18 cans\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $3/(3+2)=3/5$ of the total amount of paint is red, he will need $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot30=\\boxed{18}$ cans of red paint."
