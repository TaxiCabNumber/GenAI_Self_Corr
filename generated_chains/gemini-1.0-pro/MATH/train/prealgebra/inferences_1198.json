At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the three interior angles of a triangle are $50^\\circ$, $55^\\circ$ and $x^\\circ$. What is the degree measure of the largest interior angle of this triangle?",
        "inference": "The interior angles of a triangle must add up to $180^\\circ$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ.$$\n\nSolving for $x^\\circ$, we get:\n$$x^\\circ = 180^\\circ - 50^\\circ - 55^\\circ = 75^\\circ.$$\n\nThe largest interior angle of the triangle is the angle that measures $75^\\circ$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the interior angles of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so $50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. It follows that $x = 75$. Thus, this triangle has angles of $50^\\circ$, $55^\\circ$, and $75^\\circ$. The largest of these three angles is $\\boxed{75^\\circ}$."
