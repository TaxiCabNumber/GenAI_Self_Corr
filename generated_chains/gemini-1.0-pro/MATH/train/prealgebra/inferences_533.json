At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 10 members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, treasurer, and morale officer.  In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members can only hold at most one office?",
        "inference": "There are 10 ways to choose the president.  Once the president is chosen, there are 9 ways to choose the secretary.  Once the secretary is chosen, there are 8 ways to choose the treasurer.  Once the treasurer is chosen, there are 7 ways to choose the morale officer.  So, the number of ways to choose the officers is:\n\n$10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 5040.$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5040}. I hope it is correct.",
