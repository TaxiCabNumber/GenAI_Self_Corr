At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many degrees are in the measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is 7 p.m.?",
        "inference": "At 7 p.m. the hour hand has moved past the 6 by 1/2 of the way to the 7. This is 6 + 1/2 = 6.5 hours. Since there are 12 hours on a clock, this is 6.5/12 = 0.5417 of the way around the clock.\n\nThe minute hand has moved past the 12 by 0 minutes. This is 0/60 = 0 of the way around the clock.\n\nTherefore, the two hands are 0.5417 - 0 = 0.5417 of the way around the clock apart. Since there are 360 degrees in a circle, the measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands is 0.5417 * 360 = 194.81 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{194.81^\\circ}$.
