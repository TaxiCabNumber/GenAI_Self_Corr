At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers between 1000 and 2000 have all three of the numbers 15, 20 and 25 as factors?",
        "inference": "The numbers must have a factor of 3 and 5 in order to be divisible by 15, and a factor of 4 in order to be divisible by 20. We can thus find the number of multiples of \\(3\\times4\\times5=60\\) between 1000 and 2000, inclusive. Multiples of 60 between 1000 and 2000 inclusive are:\n1020, 1080, 1140, 1200, 1260, 1320, 1380, 1440, 1500, 1560, 1620, 1680, 1740, 1800, 1860, 1920, 1980.\nNote that 25 is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but the numbers which we have found are all also divisible by 25 since they are divisible by 5. There are \\(\\boxed{17}\\) such numbers.\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{17}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number with 15, 20 and 25 as factors must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM).  Because $15 = 3\n\\times 5$, $20 = 2^2 \\times 5$, and $25 = 5^2$, the LCM of 15, 20 and 25 is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 = 300$. There are $\\boxed{3}$ multiples of 300 between 1000 and 2000: 1200, 1500 and 1800."
