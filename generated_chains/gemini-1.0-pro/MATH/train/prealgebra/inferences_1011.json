At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular triangle has sides of length 14 cm, 8 cm and 9 cm. In centimeters, what is the perimeter of the triangle?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. So, the perimeter of the given triangle is:\n\n$$14 cm + 8 cm + 9 cm = 31 cm$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$31 cm$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of a polygon is defined to be the sum of the measures of the sides of the polygon.  Therefore, the perimeter of a triangle whose sides measure 14 cm, 8 cm, and 9 cm is $\\boxed{31}$ centimeters."
