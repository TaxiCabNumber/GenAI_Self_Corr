At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMoore's law says that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on a silicon chip doubles every two years. In 1990, a typical CPU contained about $1,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors. According to Moore's law, how many transistors did a typical CPU contain in the year 2000?",
        "inference": "* In 1990, there were 1 million transistors.\n* In 1992 (2 years later), there were 2 million transistors (double the amount of the previous year).\n* In 1994 (2 years later), there were 4 million transistors (double the amount of the previous year).\n* In 1996 (2 years later), there were 8 million transistors (double the amount of the previous year).\n* In 1998 (2 years later), there were 16 million transistors (double the amount of the previous year).\n* In 2000 (2 years later), there were 32 million transistors (double the amount of the previous year).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32,\\!000,\\!000}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$2000-1990 = 10$ years passed between the years $1990$ and $2000$, during which the number of transistors doubled $10 \\div 2 = 5$ times. Doubling a number five times means multiplying it by two raised to the fifth power. Thus we carry out the multiplication to get our answer: \\[1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 2^5 = 1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{32,\\!000,\\!000} \\text{ transistors}.\\]"
