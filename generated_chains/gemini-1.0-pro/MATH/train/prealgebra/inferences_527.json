At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSandy plans to paint one wall in her bedroom. The wall is 9 feet high and 12 feet long. There is a 2-foot by 4-foot area on that wall that she will not have to paint due to the window. How many square feet will she need to paint?",
        "inference": "First, find the area of the entire wall:\n\nArea of the wall = height * length\n= 9 feet * 12 feet\n= 108 square feet\n\nNext, find the area of the window:\n\nArea of the window = height * length\n= 2 feet * 4 feet\n= 8 square feet\n\nFinally, subtract the area of the window from the area of the wall to get the area that she will need to paint:\n\nArea to be painted = Area of the wall - Area of the window\n= 108 square feet - 8 square feet\n= 100 square feet\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$100$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the wall including the window is $9\\cdot12=108$ square feet. The area of the window is $2\\cdot4=8$ square feet. Thus, the area Sandy needs to paint is $108-8=\\boxed{100}$ square feet."
