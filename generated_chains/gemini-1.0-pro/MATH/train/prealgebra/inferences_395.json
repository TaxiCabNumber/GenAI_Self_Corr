At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe trip from Carville to Nikpath requires $4\\frac 12$ hours when traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. How many hours does the trip require when traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "Let $t$ be the time in hours to travel from Carville to Nikpath at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.\nWe know that:\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSo, for the first trip, we have:\n70 = Distance / 4.5\nAnd for the second trip, we have:\n60 = Distance / t\nSince the distance is the same for both trips, we can set the two equations equal to each other:\n70 / 4.5 = 60 / t\nSolving for $t$, we get:\nt = 60 / 70 * 4.5\nt = 4.5 * 6 / 7\nt = 3\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3.00}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\times\\text{time}$, decreasing speed by a factor of $\\frac{6}{7}$ increases the amount of time the trip takes by $\\frac{7}{6}$.  Therefore, at 60 miles per hour the trip takes $4\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{9}{2}\\cdot\\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{21}{4}=\\boxed{5.25}$ hours."
