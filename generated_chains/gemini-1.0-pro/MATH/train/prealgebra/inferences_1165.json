        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 5 a.m. temperatures for seven consecutive days were $-7^{\\circ}$, $-4^{\\circ}$, $-4^{\\circ}$, $-5^{\\circ}$, $1^{\\circ}$, $3^{\\circ}$ and $2^{\\circ}$ Celsius. What is the mean 5 a.m. temperature for the week in degrees Celsius?",
        "inference": "1. Add up all the temperatures: $-7 + (-4) + (-4) + (- 5) + 1 + 3 + 2 = -12$.\n2. Divide the sum by the number of temperatures: -12 / 7 = -1.71.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-1.71}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To add these up quickly, a trick is to simply cancel out one of the $-4$ and the 1 and 3, because those will sum to 0, and then add up 2 and $-5$ to make $-3$.  Pairing that with $-7$ to make $-10$, and then $-14$.  Dividing by 7, we get an average of $\\boxed{-2}$."
