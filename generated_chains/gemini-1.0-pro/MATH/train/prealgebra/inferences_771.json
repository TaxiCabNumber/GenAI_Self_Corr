        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery June 1, an ecologist takes a census of the number of wrens in a state park. She noticed that the number is decreasing by $40\\%$ each year. If this trend continues, in what year will the census show that the number of wrens is less than $10\\%$ of what it was on June 1, 2004?",
        "inference": "**Year 1 (June 1, 2005):**\n- Number of wrens: 60% of what it was on June 1, 2004\n\n**Year 2 (June 1, 2006):**\n- Number of wrens: 60% of 60% = 36% of what it was on June 1, 2004\n\n**Year 3 (June 1, 2007):**\n- Number of wrens: 36% of 36% = 12.96% of what it was on June 1, 2004\n\n**Year 4 (June 1, 2008):**\n- Number of wrens: 12.96% of 12.96% = 5.832% of what it was on June 1, 2004\n\nSince the number of wrens decreased to less than 10% of its original value in the fourth year, the answer is:\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{2008}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "After one year, there will be $60\\%$ left. After two years, there will be $36\\%$ left. After three years, there will be $21.6\\%$ left.\n\nAs we can see, these are just increasing powers of $60\\%$, the next year will not dip below $10\\%$, because $60\\% > 50\\%$, and $21.6 > 20$.  However, without calculating it exactly, you know that it will be less than $16.6\\%$, and thus, it will take 5 years - meaning that in $\\boxed{2009}$, the total number of wrens will drop below $10\\%$ of what it originally was."
