        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA basement has a 24-foot by 32-foot rectangular floor. The basement is flooded with water to a depth of 18 inches. Three pumps are used to pump the water out of the basement.  Each  pump will pump 8 gallons of water per minute.  If a cubic foot of water contains 7.5 gallons, how many minutes will it take  to pump all of the water out of the basement using the three  pumps?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the volume of water in the basement:\nVolume = length x width x height = 24 x 32 x 18 = 13,824 cubic feet\n\n2. Convert cubic feet to gallons:\nVolume in gallons = Volume in cubic feet x 7.5 = 13,824 x 7.5 = 103,680 gallons\n\n3. Calculate the total pumping rate of the three pumps:\nTotal pumping rate = 8 gallons per minute x 3 pumps = 24 gallons per minute\n\n4. Calculate the time it will take to pump out the water:\nTime = Volume of water to be pumped out / Total pumping rate = 103,680 gallons / 24 gallons per minute = 4,320 minutes\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4,320}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The height of the water initially in feet is $$(18 \\text{ inches})/(12 \\text{ inches/foot})=1.5\\text{ feet}.$$ The amount of water in the basement initially is $$1.5\\cdot24\\cdot32=1152\\text{ cubic feet}.$$ Converting this to gallons, we have $$(1152 \\text{ ft}^3)\\cdot(7.5 \\text { gallons/ft}^3)=8640 \\text{ gallons}.$$ If each pump can pump out 8 gallons of water per minute, then three pumps can pump out $8\\cdot3=24$ gallons a minute. So it will take $$(8640 \\text{ gallons})/(24 \\text{ gallons/minute})=\\boxed{360}$$ minutes to pump out all the water."
