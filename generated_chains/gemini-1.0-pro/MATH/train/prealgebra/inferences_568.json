At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe longest side of a right triangle is 5 meters and the shortest side is 3 meters. What is the area of the triangle in square meters?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n$$\\text{Area}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\text{base}\\times\\text{height}$$\n\nThe longest side of a right triangle is the hypotenuse, which is opposite the right angle. The shortest side is the side opposite the smallest angle.\n\nIn this case, the hypotenuse is 5 meters and the shortest side is 3 meters. Therefore, the base is 4 meters and the height is 3 meters.\n\n$$\\text{Area}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times4\\times3=6\\text{ square meters}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the hypotenuse (the longest side) of the right triangle is $5$ meters and the shortest side is $3$ meters and that $3,4,5$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, the other leg of the triangle must have a length of $4$ meters. Since the two legs are also the base and the height of the triangle, we have that the area of the triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = \\boxed{6}$ square meters.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the Pythagorean Formula to find the length of the other side. If $y$ is the length of the other leg, then we have that $3^2 + y^2 = 5^2$, so $y^2=5^2-3^2=16$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $y=4$. Since we have the lengths of both legs, we can now find that the area of the triangle is $6$ square meters."
