At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?",
        "inference": "3544 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n3554 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n3564 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n3572 is not divisible by 4 because its last two digits do not form a number that is divisible by 4.\n3576 is divisible by 4 because its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n\nThe product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3572 is $7\\times2=14$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$.

        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4. The only given number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554 because 54 is not divisible by 4. The product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3554 is $5\\cdot 4=\\boxed{20}$."
