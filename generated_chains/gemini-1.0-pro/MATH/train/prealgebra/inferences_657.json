        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest divisor of 342 that is also a factor of 285?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of 342 is \\(2\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 19\\).\nThe prime factorization of 285 is \\(3\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 19\\).\nThe largest common factor of 342 and 285 is \\(3\\cdot 3\\cdot 19 = 171\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$171$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The factors of 342 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 19, 38, 57, 114, 171, and 342. The factors of 285 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 19, 57, 95, and 285. By comparing the two lists, we can see that the numbers that are factors of both 342 and 285 are 1, 3, 19, and 57. So, the largest divisor of both 342 and 285 is $\\boxed{57}$."
