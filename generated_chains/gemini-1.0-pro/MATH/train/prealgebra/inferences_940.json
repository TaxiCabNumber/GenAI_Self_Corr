        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine wishes to purchase some trading cards. She has $\\$7.50$ and the cards each cost $\\$0.85$, tax included. What is the most number of cards she can buy?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine how many cards she can buy without exceeding her budget.\n\n**Calculation:** $7.50 \u00f7 0.85 = 8.82$\n\n**Step 2:** Since Jasmine cannot purchase a fraction of a card, round down to the nearest whole number to find the maximum number of cards she can buy.\n\n**Calculation:** $8.82$ rounded down to the nearest whole number is $8$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of $n$ cards is $(0.85)n$ dollars. Jasmine can buy $n$ cards only if $(0.85)n \\le 7.5$. Rewriting this inequality in terms of fractions, we have $$\\frac{17}{20}n\\le \\frac{15}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{20}{17}$ gives $$n \\le \\frac{150}{17},$$ and converting to mixed numbers gives $$n \\le 8\\frac{14}{17}.$$ Since Jasmine must buy a whole number of trading cards, the largest number she can afford is $\\boxed{8}$."
