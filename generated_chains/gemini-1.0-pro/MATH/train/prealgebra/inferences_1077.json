At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrew and John are both Beatles fans.  Their respective collections share nine of the same albums.  Andrew has seventeen albums in his collection.  Six albums are in John's collection, but not Andrew's.  How many albums are in either Andrew's or John's collection, but not both?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the total number of albums in Andrew's collection.\nAndrew has 17 albums in his collection.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of albums in John's collection.\nJohn has 6 albums in his collection that are not in Andrew's collection. Since they share 9 albums, John must have 6 + 9 = 15 albums total.\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the number of albums in both Andrew's and John's collections.\nThey share 9 albums.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the total number of albums in either Andrew's or John's collection, but not both.\nTotal albums = Albums in Andrew's collection + Albums in John's collection - Albums in both collections\nTotal albums = 17 + 15 - 9\nTotal albums = 23\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$23$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $17-9=8$ albums in Andrew's collection but not John's, and $6$ albums in John's collection but not Andrew's.  So there are $8+6=\\boxed{14}$ albums in either Andrew's or John's collection, but not both."
