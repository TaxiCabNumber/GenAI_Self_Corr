        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo make lemonade, I use a ratio of $7$ parts water to $1$ part lemon juice. If I want to make a gallon of lemonade, and there are four quarts in a gallon, how many quarts of water do I need? Write your answer as a proper or improper fraction.",
        "inference": "Since there are four quarts in a gallon, I need $4$ quarts of lemonade.\n\nSince the ratio of water to lemon juice is $7:1$, for every $1$ quart of lemon juice, I need $7$ quarts of water.\n\nTherefore, for $4$ quarts of lemonade, I need $7 \\times 4 = \\boxed{28}$ quarts of water.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To make lemonade, I need a total of $7 + 1 = 8$ parts liquid. Because I am making a gallon of lemonade, each part must be $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a gallon. Converting to quarts gives that each part is $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$ of a quart. Since I have $7$ parts water, I therefore need $7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$ quarts of water."
