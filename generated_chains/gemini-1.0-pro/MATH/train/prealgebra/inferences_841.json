        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLyndy conducted a survey of the 300 students in her school. She found that 60 students own dogs, while only 30 students own cats. What percent of the students own cats?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** \n1. Find the fraction of students who own cats by dividing the number of students who own cats by the total number of students: 30/300 = 1/10.\n2. Convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/10 = 0.1.\n3. Multiply the decimal by 100 to convert it to a percentage: 0.1 x 100 = 10%.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "30 of the students own cats, and there are 300 students total, which makes for a fraction: $\\frac{30}{300} = \\frac{1}{10} = \\boxed{10\\%}$."
