At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe complement of an angle is $5^{\\circ}$ more than four times the angle. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the angle?",
        "inference": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$.\n\nThen, the complement of the angle is $90 - x$.\n\nAccording to the given information,\n\n$$90 - x = 4x + 5$$\n\nSolving for $x$,\n\n$$90 - 5 = 4x + x$$\n\n$$85 = 5x$$\n\nDividing both sides by $5$,\n\n$$\\frac{85}{5} = x$$\n\n$$x = 17$$\n\nHence, the measure of the angle is $\\boxed{17}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\\circ$.  Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\\circ) = 90^\\circ$.  Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\\circ = 90^\\circ$, so $5x = 85^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{17^\\circ}$."
