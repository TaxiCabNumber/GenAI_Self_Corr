        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular polygon has sides of length 5 units and an exterior angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the polygon, in units?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of sides of the polygon.\nSince the exterior angle is 120 degrees, the interior angle is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon with n sides is (n - 2) * 180 degrees.\nSo, (n - 2) * 180 = 60n\n360 = 60n\nn = 6\nTherefore, the polygon has 6 sides.\n\n2. Find the perimeter of the polygon.\nThe perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all the sides.\nPerimeter = 6 * 5 = 30 units.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{30}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If an exterior angle has measure $120$ degrees, an interior angle has measure $60$ degrees.  A regular polygon with $60$ degree angles must be an equilateral triangle, so the perimeter is $3(5)=\\boxed{15}$ units."
