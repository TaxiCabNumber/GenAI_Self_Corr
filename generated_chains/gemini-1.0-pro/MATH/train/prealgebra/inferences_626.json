        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA basketball player made the following number of free throws in 8 successive games: 6, 18, 15, 14, 19, 12, 19, and 15. What is the median number of successful free throws?",
        "inference": "1. Arrange the data in ascending order: 6, 12, 14, 15, 15, 18, 19, 19\n2. Since there are 8 data points, the middle one is the median. Therefore, the median is the 4th one.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the median, we first arrange the number of successful free throws in increasing numerical order: $$6,12,14,15,15,18,19,19.$$ Since there is an even number of terms, the median can be found the by averaging the middle two (the fourth and the fifth) terms. Both the fourth and the fifth terms are $15$, so the median number of successful free throws that the basketball player made is $\\boxed{15}$."
