At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe three-digit integer $63\\underline{\\hphantom{0}}$ is a multiple of 3. What is the greatest possible difference between two of the possibilities for the units digit?",
        "inference": "Since $63\\underline{\\hphantom{0}}$ is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of $6$ and $3$ is $9$, so the units digit must be a multiple of $3$ between $0$ and $9$.\n\nThe possible units digits are $0$, $3$, $6$, and $9$. The greatest possible difference between two of these digits is $9-0=\\boxed{9}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The integer is a multiple of three if the sum of its digits is a multiple of three. Since 6 and 3 are both multiples of three, the units digit must also be a multiple of three. The possibilities for this digit are 0, 3, 6, or 9. The greatest possible difference between any two possibilities is $9-0=\\boxed{9}$."
