At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular polygon has interior angles of 120 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula:\n\n$$(n-2)\\cdot180^\\circ$$\n\nIf the interior angles of a regular polygon are 120 degrees, then we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$(n-2)\\cdot180^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\cdot n$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$180^\\circ\\cdot n - 360^\\circ = 120^\\circ \\cdot n$$\n\n$$60^\\circ\\cdot n = 360^\\circ$$\n\n$$n = 6$$\n\nTherefore, the regular polygon has 6 sides.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $120^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $120n$.  Therefore, we must have  \\[180(n-2) = 120n.\\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 120n$, so $60n = 360$ and $n = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nWe might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\\circ$, so there must be $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60^\\circ} = 6$ of them in the polygon."
