At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangular playground exceeds twice its width by 25 feet, and the perimeter of the playground is 650 feet. What is the area of the playground in square feet?",
        "inference": "Let's assume that the width of the playground is x feet.\nThen, the length of the playground is (2x + 25) feet.\nThe perimeter of the playground is 2(length + width) = 2(2x + 25 + x) = 6x + 50 feet.\nGiven that the perimeter of the playground is 650 feet, we have:\n6x + 50 = 650\n6x = 600\nx = 100\nTherefore, the width of the playground is 100 feet, and the length of the playground is (2x + 25) = (2 * 100 + 25) = 225 feet.\nHence, the area of the playground is length * width = 225 * 100 = 22500 square feet.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$22500$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the width of the rectangular playground is $w$, then the length is $2w + 25$. A perimeter of 650 feet means the semi-perimeter is 325 feet. The width plus the length equals the semi-perimeter, so $w + 2w + 25 = 325$. That means $3w = 300$, so $w = 100$ feet. The length must be $2 \\times 100 + 25 =\n225$. The area of the playground is $100 \\times 225 = \\boxed{22,500}$ square feet."
