At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a sale, a store owner reduces the price of a $\\$10$ scarf by $30\\%$. Later the price is lowered again, this time by $50\\%$ of the reduced price. What is the current price, in dollars?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the first discount.**\nThe first discount is 30% of $10, which is 0.30 * 10 = $3.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the reduced price after the first discount.**\nThe reduced price is $10 - $3 = $7.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the second discount.**\nThe second discount is 50% of $7, which is 0.50 * 7 = $3.50.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the current price.**\nThe current price is the reduced price after the first discount minus the second discount, which is $7 - $3.50 = **$3.50**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3.50}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The sale price is $70\\%$ of the original price, or $\\$7.00$. After the next reduction, the final price is one-half the sale price of $\\$7.00$. or $\\boxed{\\$3.50}$."
