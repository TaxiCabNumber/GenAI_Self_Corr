        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer value of $x$ for which $5-4x>17$?",

        "ground_truth": "Adding $4x$ to both sides, we have $5 > 17+4x$. Then, subtracting $17$ from both sides, we have $-12 > 4x$. Finally, dividing both sides by $4$, we have $-3 > x$. This inequality states that $x$ is strictly less than $-3$. The largest integer satisfying that condition is $\\boxed{-4}$."
