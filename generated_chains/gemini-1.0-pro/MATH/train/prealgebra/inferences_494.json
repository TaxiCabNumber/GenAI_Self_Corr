At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe median of the set $\\{n, n + 5, n + 6, n + 9, n + 15\\}$ is 9. What is the mean?",

Since the median is 9, we can split the set into two halves:\n\n$\\{n, n + 5, n + 6\\} = \\{8, 11, 12\\}$\nand\n$\\{n + 9, n + 15\\} = \\{14, 20\\}$\n\nSince the median is 9, we know that $n + 6 = 9$, which means $n = 3$.\n\nThe mean is the average of a set of values. To find the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values. In this case, we have:\n\n$(3 + 8 + 11 + 12 + 14 + 20) / 6 = 78 / 6 = 13$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
