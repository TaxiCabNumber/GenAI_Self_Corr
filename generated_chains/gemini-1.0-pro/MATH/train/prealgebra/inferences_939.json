At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn an indoor circular track of circumference 50 feet, Joneal starts at point $S$, runs in a counterclockwise direction, and then stops when he has run exactly one mile (5280 feet). On which quarter of the circle, $A$, $B$, $C$ or $D$, did Joneal stop?\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw((-25,0)--(25,0));\ndraw((0,-25)--(0,25));\ndot((20,0));\nlabel(\"$S$\",(20,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(17,17),E);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-17,17),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-17,-17),W);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(17,-17),E);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "Since the circumference of the track is 50 feet, Joneal runs $5280/50=105.6$ times around the track. Since $105.6$ is not a whole number, Joneal runs a little bit more than 105 times around the track. The remaining distance is $105.6-105=0.6$ of the circumference of the track. To find out which quarter of the circle Joneal stopped at, we multiply $0.6$ by the circumference of the track and divide by $4$ (the number of quarters in a circle): $(0.6)(50)/4=7.5$ feet.\n\nSo Joneal stopped at the quarter of the circle that is $7.5$ feet from the starting point. Since $7.5$ is greater than $5$, Joneal stopped at quarter of the circle $B$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{B}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 5250 is divisible by 50, Joneal is back at point $S$ after running 5250 feet.  For the next 12.5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $A$. For the next 12.5 feet after that, he is on the portion of the track marked $B$.  At this point he has traveled $5250+12.5+12.5=5275$ feet.  After traveling the final 5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $\\boxed{C}$."
