At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 6 married couples at a party. At the start of the party, every person shakes hands once with every other person except his or her spouse. How many handshakes are there?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Determine the number of handshakes per couple.\nEach person in a couple shakes hands with 5 other people (everyone except their spouse and themselves). So, there are 5 handshakes per couple.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the number of handshakes per couple by the number of couples.\nThere are 6 couples at the party, so there are 6 * 5 = 30 handshakes in total.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{30}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "All 12 people shake hands with 10 other people (everyone except themselves and their spouse).  In multiplying $12 \\times 10$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\\dfrac{12 \\times 10}{2} = \\boxed{60}$ handshakes."
