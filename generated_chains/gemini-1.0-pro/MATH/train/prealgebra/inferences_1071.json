At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we roll a standard fair 6-sided die.  What is the probability that a perfect square is rolled?",
        "inference": "The possible outcomes when rolling a standard fair 6-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe perfect squares between 1 and 6 are 1 and 4.\nSo, the probability of rolling a perfect square is 2/6 = 1/3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A 1 or 4 can be rolled for success, which is 2 out of 6 possible outcomes, so its probability is $\\dfrac26 = \\boxed{\\dfrac13}$."
