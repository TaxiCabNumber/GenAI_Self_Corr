        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn recently bought a used car for $\\$5000$ for his pizza delivery job. He gets $\\$10$ for each pizza he delivers, but he has to spend $\\$3$ on gas for each pizza he delivers. What is the minimum whole number of pizzas John must deliver in order to earn back the money he spent on the car he bought?",
        "inference": "Let the number of pizzas John must deliver be $x$. The total amount he earns is $10x$ dollars. Since he spends $3$ dollars on gas for each pizza, the total amount he spends on gas is $3x$ dollars. Thus, the net amount he earns is $10x - 3x = 7x$ dollars. To earn back the money he spent on the car, he needs $7x = 5000$. Solving for $x$, we have $x = \\frac{5000}{7} = 714.2857...$. Since the number of pizzas must be a whole number, the minimum whole number of pizzas John must deliver is $\\boxed{715}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{715}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ be the number of pizzas he bought. He makes $10p$ dollars selling $p$ pizzas, but he spends $3p$ dollars on gas. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n10p-3p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge \\frac{5000}{7} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge 714\\frac{2}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, John must sell at least $\\boxed{715}$ pizzas to earn back the $\\$5000$ he spent on the car."
