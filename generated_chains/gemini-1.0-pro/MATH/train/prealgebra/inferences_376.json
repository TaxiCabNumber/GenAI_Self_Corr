At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSami remembers that the digits in her new three-digit area code contain a 9, 8, and 7, but she can't recall the order. How many possibilities are there for her to try?",

I hope it is correct.",
