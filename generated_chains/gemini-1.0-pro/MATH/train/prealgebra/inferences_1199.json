At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have eleven books, of which I want to bring two to read on vacation. How many different pairs can I choose?",

But each pair has been counted twice (once for each ordering of the two books). Since order doesn't matter, the actual number of pairs I can choose is $(11\\cdot 10)/2$, which is $\\boxed{55}$."
