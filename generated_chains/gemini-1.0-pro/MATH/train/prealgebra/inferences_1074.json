I hope it is correct.'\nA new train goes $20\\%$ farther than an older train in the same amount of time. During the time it takes the older train to go 200 miles, how many miles can the newer train complete?",
        "inference": "Let the speed of the older train be \\( x \\) miles per hour and the speed of the newer train be \\( y \\) miles per hour.\n\nThe distance travelled by the older train in \\( t \\) hours is \\( 200 \\) miles.\n\nThe distance travelled by the newer train in \\( t \\) hours is \\( y \\) miles.\n\nAccording to the given condition, we have:\n\n$$ y = x + 0.2x $$\n\n$$ y = 1.2x $$\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( y \\) in the expression for the distance travelled by the newer train, we get:\n\n$$ Distance = 1.2x \\times t $$\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( t = \\frac{200}{x} \\) from the given condition, we get:\n\n$$ Distance = 1.2x \\times \\frac{200}{x} $$\n\n$$ Distance = 240 $$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{240}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$20\\%$ of $200$ is $40$.  So the new train goes $200+40=\\boxed{240}$ miles."
