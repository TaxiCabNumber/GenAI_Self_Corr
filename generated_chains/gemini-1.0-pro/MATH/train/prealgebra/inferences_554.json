        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $4\\sqrt{2}$ units. How many square units are in the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Since the triangle is isosceles, the legs are equal. Let $x$ be the length of one of the legs. Then the hypotenuse is $x\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the hypotenuse is $4\\sqrt{2}$ units. So we have the equation $x\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Solving for $x$, we get $x = 4$.\n\nStep 4: The area of an isosceles right triangle with legs of length $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. So the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 = 8$ square units.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg of the triangle has length 4.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(4)(4)/2 = \\boxed{8}$ square units."
