At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only six slices have pepperoni, and exactly ten slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
        "inference": "Let p be the number of slices with pepperoni and m be the number of slices with mushrooms. \nWe know that p + m = 12 and p = 6. \nSubstituting p = 6 into the first equation, we get 6 + m = 12, which gives m = 6. \nTherefore, the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms is m = 6. \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 total slices, and 6 of them have pepperoni and 10 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number of the slices that have both toppings, so there are $6-n$ with just pepperoni and $10-n$ with just mushrooms.  Since every slice has at least one topping, and there are 12 slices, we must have $(6-n) + (10-n) + n = 12$, which gives $n=\\boxed{4}$."
