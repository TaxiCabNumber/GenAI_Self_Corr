I hope it is correct.'\nJori has 2 gallons of distilled water and uses 7/6 gallon in a science experiment. What fraction of a gallon does she have left?",

Subtract the amount of water Jori uses from the original amount of water to find the amount of water she has left: 2 gallons - 7/6 gallons = 12/6 gallons - 7/6 gallons = 5/6 gallons\n3. The fraction of a gallon Jori has left is 5/6 gallons.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5/6}. I hope it is correct.",
