I hope it is correct.'\nAn athlete's heart beats an average of 150 times per minute while running. How many times does the athlete's heart beat during a 26-mile race if the athlete runs at a pace of 5 minutes per mile?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the athlete's pace to minutes per mile: \n$$5 \\frac{min}{mile}$$\n\n2. Multiply the athlete's pace by the number of miles to get the total time of the race:\n$$5 \\frac{min}{mile} \\times 26 miles = 130 minutes$$\n\n3. Multiply the athlete's heart rate by the total time of the race to get the total number of heartbeats:\n$$150 \\frac{beats}{min} \\times 130 min =19500 beats$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{19500}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
