At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe local theater has one ticket window. In how many ways can six people line up to buy a ticket?",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must count the number of permutations of 6 people.  There are 6 choices for the first person in line, 5 choices for the second person in line, etc.  So the answer is $6\\cdot5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{720}$."
