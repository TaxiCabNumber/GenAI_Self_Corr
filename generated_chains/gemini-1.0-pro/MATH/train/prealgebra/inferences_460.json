        "ground_truth": "We know that Sara used 3/10 rolls on three presents, so to find the amount of wrapping paper she used on one present, we need to divide 3/10 by 3. We remember that division by a number is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal. Also, the reciprocal of $3$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, we have $$\\frac{3}{10} \\div 3 = \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{10 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{3}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}.$$Sara used $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$ of a roll of wrapping paper on each present."
