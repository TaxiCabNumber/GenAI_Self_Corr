At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of a pair of supplementary angles are in the ratio of 7:2. How many degrees are in the measure of their positive difference?",
        "inference": "Let the angles be $7x$ and $2x$.\n\nSince the angles are supplementary, their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore,\n\n$$7x+2x=180^\\circ\\Rightarrow 9x=180^\\circ\\Rightarrow x=20^\\circ.$$\n\nThe positive difference between the angles is $7x-2x=5x=5(20^\\circ)=\\boxed{100^\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the measures are in the ratio $7:2$, the measures are $7x$ and $2x$ for some value of $x$.  Since the angles are supplementary, we have $7x + 2x = 180^\\circ$, so $9x = 180^\\circ$ and $x= 20^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $7x=140^\\circ$ and $2x=40^\\circ$, so their positive difference is $140^\\circ - 40^\\circ = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$."
