At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAngie's class has 2 girls for every 3 boys. If there are 20 students in the class, how many girls are in Angie's class?",
        "inference": "Number of boys = $x$\nNumber of girls = $2x$ (since there are 2 girls for every 3 boys)\nTotal number of students = $x + 2x = 3x$\nGiven that the total number of students is 20, therefore, $3x = 20$\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{20}{3}$\nNumber of girls = $2x = 2 \\times \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{40}{3}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13.33}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $2k$ is the number of girls in Angie's class, then $3k$ is the number of boys.  The total number of students is $2k+3k=5k$.  Solving $5k=20$ gives $k=4$, so there are $2(4)=\\boxed{8}$ girls in Angie's class."
