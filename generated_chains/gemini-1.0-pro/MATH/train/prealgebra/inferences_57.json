        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI need to learn vocabulary words for my Spanish exam. There are 500 words and the exam grade is the percentage of these words that I recall correctly. Assuming I will recall correctly the words I learn and assuming my guesses will not yield any points, what is the least number of words I should learn to get at least $85\\%$ on the exam?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of words learned.\n\nThe number of words recalled correctly will be $x$.\n\nThe number of words not recalled correctly will be $500-x$.\n\nThe percentage of words recalled correctly will be $\\frac{x}{500}\\times100\\%$.\n\nWe want this percentage to be at least $85\\%$.\n\nTherefore, we have the inequality:\n\n$\\frac{x}{500}\\times100\\%\\geq85\\%$\n\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n\n$x\\geq\\frac{85}{100}\\times500=425$\n\nTherefore, the least number of words that should be learned is $425$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{425}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the exam grade is the percentage of words I recall correctly, we can set up a proportion to find the minimum number of words I need to learn: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\text{number of words I need to learn}}{\\text{total words}}&=\\frac{85\\%}{100\\%}\\\\\n\\frac{x}{500}&=\\frac{85}{100}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{85}{100}\\cdot 500\\\\\nx&=85\\cdot 5\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{425}.\n\\end{align*}Learning 425 words will lead to a score of exactly $85\\%$, so I do not need to learn any more words than 425."
