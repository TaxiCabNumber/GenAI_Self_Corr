At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the mean value of the measures of the three interior angles of any triangle?",
        "inference": "The interior angles of a triangle add up to $$180^\\circ$$.\nSo, the mean value of the three interior angles is $$\\frac{180^\\circ}{3}=\\boxed{60^\\circ}$$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by the total number of numbers.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, and there are 3 angles.  Hence their mean is $\\frac{180^\\circ}{3} = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$."
