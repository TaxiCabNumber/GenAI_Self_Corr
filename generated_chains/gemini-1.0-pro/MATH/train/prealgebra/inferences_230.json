        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be x, x + 1, and x + 2. Then we have:\n\nx * (x + 1) * (x + 2) = 210\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 210\n\nRearranging:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 210 = 0\n\nFactoring:\n\n(x - 5)(x^2 + 8x + 42) = 0\n\nThe first factor gives us x = 5. The second factor is a quadratic that cannot be factored over rational numbers, but we can use the quadratic formula to find the other two roots:\n\nx = (-8 \u00b1 \u221a(8^2 - 4 * 1 * 42)) / 2 * 1\n\nx = (-8 \u00b1 \u221a(64 - 168)) / 2\n\nx = (-8 \u00b1 \u221a-104) / 2\n\nx = (-8 \u00b1 8i\u221a-1) / 2\n\nx = -4 \u00b1 4i\u221a-1\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the numbers are integers, we can discard the complex roots and conclude that the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe sum of these integers is 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{15}.
