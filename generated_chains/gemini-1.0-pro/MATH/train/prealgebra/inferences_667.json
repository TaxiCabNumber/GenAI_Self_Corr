At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSasha has $\\$3.20$ in U.S. coins. She has the same number of quarters and nickels. What is the greatest number of quarters she could have?",
        "inference": "Let's say she has \\(x\\) quarters.\nSince she has the same number of quarters and nickels, she also has \\(x\\) nickels. \nThe total value of her coins is \n\n$$0.25x + 0.05x = 3.20$$\n\n$$0.30x = 3.20$$\n\n$$x = 3.20/0.30 = 10.67$$\n\nSince she can't have a fraction of a quarter, the greatest number of quarters she could have is 10.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10$}.

        "ground_truth": "Suppose Sasha has $q$ quarters.  Then she also has $q$ nickels, and the total value of her quarters and nickels is $.25q + .05q = .30q$.  Since $3.20/0.30 = 10\\frac{2}{3}$, this means that she has at most $\\boxed{10}$ quarters.  (This amount is obtainable; for example we can let the rest of her coins be pennies.)"
