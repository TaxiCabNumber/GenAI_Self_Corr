At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob's favorite number is between $50$ and $100$.  It is a multiple of $11$, but not a multiple of $2$.  The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?",

The sum of the digits of $55$ is $5 + 5 = 10$, which is not a multiple of $3$.  The sum of the digits of $66$ is $6 + 6 = 12$, which is a multiple of $3$.  Therefore, Bob's favorite number is $66$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}$. I hope it is correct.",

If our work is correct, there should only be one number, the answer, that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThe multiples of $11$ that we are interested in are $55$, $66$, $77$, $88$, and $99$. $66$ and $88$ are multiples of $2$, so they are out.  Now, of the remaining numbers, only $99$ has a digit-sum that is a multiple of $3$ ($9+9=18$).  Therefore, Bob's favorite number is $\\boxed{99}$."
