        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is three times its width. The perimeter is 160 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the width of the rectangle be x cm.\n\nThen, the length of the rectangle is 3x cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 2(length + width) cm.\n\nTherefore, 2(length + width) = 160 cm.\n\n=> 2(3x + x) = 160 cm.\n\n=> 2(4x) = 160 cm.\n\n=> 4x = 160 cm / 2.\n\n=> 4x = 80 cm.\n\n=> x = 80 cm / 4.\n\n=> x = 20 cm.\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 20 cm.\n\nAnd, the length of the rectangle is 3x = 3 * 20 cm = 60 cm.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is length * width cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 60 cm * 20 cm = 1200 cm^2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1200}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \\cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 3w \\\\\n2l + 2w &= 160 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(3w)+2w=160$ or $w=20$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=3(20)=60$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \\cdot w = 60 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{1200}$ square centimeters."
