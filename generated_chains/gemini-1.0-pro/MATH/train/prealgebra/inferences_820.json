        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 125th digit beyond the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac47$?",
        "inference": "The decimal representation of $\\frac47$ is $0.\\overline{571428}$.\n\nThere is a cycle of length 6 in the digits after the decimal point.\n\nThe 125th digit beyond the decimal point is the 5th digit in the cycle.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Manually dividing, we see that $4 \\div 7 = 0.57142857\\ldots$. Therefore, the decimal representation of $\\frac 47$ repeats after every $6$ digits. Since $125 = 20 \\times 6 + 5$, the $125$th digit beyond the decimal point is the same as the $5$th digit beyond the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
