At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmanda, Ben, and Carlos share a sum of money. Their portions are in the ratio of 1:2:7, respectively. If Amanda's portion is $\\$$20, what is the total amount of money shared?",
        "inference": "Let's say that the total amount of money shared is x. Then, Amanda's portion is x/10, Ben's portion is x/5, and Carlos' portion is x/10*7 = 7x/10. Since Amanda's portion is $20, we can write:\n\n```\nx/10 = 20\n```\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 200\n```\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money shared is $200.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars."
