I hope it is correct.'\nCutting equilateral triangle $BFC$ out of square $ABCD$ and translating it to the left of the square creates the shaded figure $ABFCDE$.

Therefore, the side of the equilateral triangle $BFC$ is also 12 inches.\nThe perimeter of $ABFCDE$ is the perimeter of $ABCD$ minus the perimeter of $BFC$ plus the perimeter of $ABF$:\n$$48-12+12+12+12=\\boxed{56}$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$56$}.

        "ground_truth": "Originally, every side length of the square had a length of 12.  Since the triangle is equilateral, each of its side lengths is also 12.  There are now a total of 6 sides, making for a perimeter of $\\boxed{72}$."
