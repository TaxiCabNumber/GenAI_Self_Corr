At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of the day, a bakery had $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie left over. Louie, Duey and Huey split the pie, with each taking home the same amount of leftover pie. How much pie did Louie take home?",
        "inference": "Since there was $\\frac{6}{7}$ of the pie left, and it was split equally among the three boys, Louie took home $\\frac{1}{3}$ of that amount, which is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$ of the whole pie.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$. \\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{6}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}\\text{ of a pie}$."
