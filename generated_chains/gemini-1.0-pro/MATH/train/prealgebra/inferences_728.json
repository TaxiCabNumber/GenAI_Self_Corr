        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nThe prime factorizations of $18$ and $42$ are $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$ and $42 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smaller exponent: $\\text{GCD} = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. The least common multiple (LCM) is the product of all the prime factors raised to the greater exponent: $\\text{LCM} = 2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 = 42$. Therefore, the product of the GCD and LCM is $\\text{GCD} \\cdot \\text{LCM} = 6 \\cdot 42 = 252$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{252}$. I hope it is correct.**",
