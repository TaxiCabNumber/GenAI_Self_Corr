At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf infinitely many values of $y$ satisfy the equation $2(4+cy) = 12y+8$, then what is the value of $c$?",
        "inference": "Equating the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, we have $8=10$, which is a false statement. Therefore, there are no values of $y$ that satisfy the equation, and the value of $c$ is irrelevant.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Simplifying both sides gives $8+2cy = 12y+8$.  Subtracting $8$ from both sides gives $2cy = 12y$.  If $c=\\boxed{6}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $y$ (so it has infinitely many solutions).  Otherwise, the equation has only one solution ($y=0$)."
