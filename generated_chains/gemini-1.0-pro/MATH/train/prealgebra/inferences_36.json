At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven the three digits 2, 4 and 7, how many different positive two-digit integers can be formed using these digits if a digit may not be repeated in an integer?",

Therefore, the total number of different two-digit integers is 3 * 2 = 6.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
