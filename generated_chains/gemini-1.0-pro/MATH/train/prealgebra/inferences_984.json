At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of five children is 6 years old. Each child is a different age and there is a difference of two years in the ages of any two consecutive children. In years, how old is the oldest child?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the ages of the children as x, x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8. \nThe average age is calculated by adding the ages of all children and dividing by the total number of children. \nIn this case, the average age is 6, so we have:\n(x + x + 2 + x + 4 + x + 6 + x + 8) / 5 = 6\nSimplifying the equation:\n5x + 20 = 30\nSubtracting 20 from both sides:\n5x = 10\nDividing both sides by 5:\nx = 2\nSo, the youngest child is 2 years old. \nSince there is a difference of two years in the ages of any two consecutive children, the oldest child must be:\n2 + 8 = 10 years old.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the ages form an arithmetic progression (an evenly spaced sequence) with an odd number of terms, the median age is the same as the average age.  Therefore, the age of the third child is $6$, the second child is $8$ years old, and the first child is $\\boxed{10}$ years old."
