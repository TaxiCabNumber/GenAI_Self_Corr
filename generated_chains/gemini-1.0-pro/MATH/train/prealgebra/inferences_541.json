        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ inches long. How many inches long is the side of the square?",
        "inference": "Let's call the side of the square \"s\".\n\nWe know that the diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of a side. So, we can write an equation:\n\n```\ns * $\\sqrt{2}$ = $\\sqrt{2}$\n```\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n\n```\ns = 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the side of the square is 1 inch long.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since a diagonal of a square breaks up the square into two 45-45-90 triangles, a diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side. Thus, the length of a side of the square is $\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{1}$ inch."
