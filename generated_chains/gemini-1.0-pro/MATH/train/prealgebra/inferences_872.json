At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJamie has a jar of coins containing the same number of nickels, dimes and quarters. The total value of the coins in the jar is $\\$$13.20. How many nickels does Jamie have?",
        "inference": "Let the number of nickels, dimes, and quarters be $n$.  Since the value of a nickel is $\\\\$0.05, a dime is $\\\\$0.10$, and a quarter is $\\\\$0.25$, we have the equation:\n\n$$0.05n+0.10n+0.25n=13.20$$\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$$0.40n=13.20$$\nDividing both sides by $0.40$, we get:\n\n$$n=33$$\nSo there are $\\boxed{33}$ nickels in the jar.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Writing the problem in cents, and letting the number of each coin be $x$, we have $5x + 10x + 25x = 1320$, or $40x = 1320$. This gives immediately $x =\n\\boxed{33}$."
