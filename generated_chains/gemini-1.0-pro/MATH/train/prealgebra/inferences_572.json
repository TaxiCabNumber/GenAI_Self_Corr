At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRobin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other?",
        "inference": "**Thinking Step 1:**\nThere are 4 options for the first scoop on the cone.\n\n**Thinking Step 2:**\nOnce the first scoop is chosen, there are 3 options for the second scoop.\n\n**Thinking Step 3:**\nAfter that, there are 2 options for the third scoop.\n\n**Thinking Step 4:**\nFinally, there is only 1 option for the fourth scoop.\n\n**Thinking Step 5:**\nMultiplying the number of options at each step, we get:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$24$}. I hope it is correct.**",

Similarly there are 2 choices for the third scoop, and the final scoop is uniquely determined.  In total, there are $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = \\boxed{24}$ orders."
