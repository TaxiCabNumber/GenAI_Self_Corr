At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEugene, Brianna, and Katie are going on a run. Eugene runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour. If Brianna runs $\\frac{2}{3}$ as fast as Eugene, and Katie runs $\\frac{7}{5}$ as fast as Brianna, how fast does Katie run?",
