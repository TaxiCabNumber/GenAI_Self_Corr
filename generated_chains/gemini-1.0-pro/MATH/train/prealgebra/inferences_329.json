At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book with 53 pages numbered 1 to 53 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 53 to 1. For how many pages do the new page number and old page number share the same units digit?",
        "inference": "Number of pages with units digit of 1: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 2: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 3: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 4: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 5: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 6: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 7: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 8: 10\nNumber of pages with units digit of 9: 10\n\nTotal number of pages: 53.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{53}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each page is assigned two numbers. We can generalize the numbers assigned to page $x$ to be the pair $x$ and $54-x$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq 53$. That is, if $x = 1$, then we can see that page number one is assigned the numbers $1$ and $54-1 = 53$. It is fairly easy to see that the units digits of $x$ and $54-x$ will only be the same if $x$ has a units digit of $2$ or a units digit of $7$. Thus, we simply must count how many such $x$ there are between $1$ and $54$. Possibilities for $x$ are: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47, and 52. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ such pages."
