At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the largest and smallest prime factors of 990?",
        "inference": "The prime factors of 990 are 2, 3, 5, and 11.\nThe largest prime factor is 11 and the smallest prime factor is 2.\nThe sum of the largest and smallest prime factors is 11 + 2 = 13.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Taking the prime factorization of 990, we get $2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot11$. So, our answer is $11+2=\\boxed{13}$."
