At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve students in Mrs. Stephenson's class have brown eyes. Twenty students in the class have a lunch box. Of Mrs. Stephenson's 30 students, what is the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box?",
        "inference": "1. The question asks for the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box. Therefore, the number of students who have both brown eyes and a lunch box must be as small as possible while still satisfying the given conditions.\n\n\n2. The first condition is that 12 students have brown eyes. This means that at least 12 students in the class must have brown eyes.\n\n\n3. The second condition is that 20 students have a lunch box. This means that at least 20 students in the class must have a lunch box.\n\n\n4. The third condition is that there are 30 students in the class. This means that the total number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box, plus the number of students who have brown eyes but not a lunch box, plus the number of students who have a lunch box but not brown eyes, must be equal to 30.\n\n\n5. To find the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box, we can start by assuming that all 12 students who have brown eyes also have a lunch box. This would mean that there are 12 students who have both brown eyes and a lunch box.\n\n\n6. This leaves 18 students who have either brown eyes or a lunch box, but not both. We can then further assume that of these 18 students, 7 have brown eyes but not a lunch box, and 11 have a lunch box but not brown eyes.\n\n\n7. This gives us a total of 19 students who have brown eyes or a lunch box, but only 12 who have both. This satisfies the given conditions and gives us the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $20$ students have a lunch box, $10$ students do not have a lunch box.  So at most $10$ students with brown eyes do not have a lunch box, and at least $\\boxed{2}$ students with brown eyes must have a lunch box."
