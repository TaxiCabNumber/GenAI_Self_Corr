        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiselle will combine blue paint, green paint, and white paint in the ratio $3:2:4$, respectively. If she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, how many quarts of green paint should she use?",
        "inference": "Since the ratio of blue paint, green paint, and white paint is $3:2:4$, the number of quarts of blue paint is $3x$, the number of quarts of green paint is $2x$, and the number of quarts of white paint is $4x$.\n\nSince Giselle uses $12$ quarts of white paint, we have $4x=12$. Therefore, $x=3$.\n\nThe number of quarts of green paint is $2x=2(3)=\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of white paint to green paint is $4:2$ which simplifies to $2:1$, so Giselle should use twice as much white paint as green paint. Since she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, she should use $12 \\div 2 = \\boxed{6}$ quarts of green paint."
