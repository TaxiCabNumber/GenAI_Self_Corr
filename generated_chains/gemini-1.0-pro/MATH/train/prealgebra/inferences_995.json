At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEveryone in a class of 30 students takes math and history.  Seven students received an A in history and 13 received an A in math, including four that received an A in both courses. How many students did not receive an A in any of these two courses?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the number of students who received an A in Math only.**\n\nSubtract the number of students who received an A in both Math and History from the total number of students who received an A in Math:\n\n```\n13 - 4 = 9 students\n```\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of students who received an A in History only.**\n\nSubtract the number of students who received an A in both Math and History from the total number of students who received an A in History:\n\n```\n7 - 4 = 3 students\n```\n\n**Step 3: Add the number of students who received an A in only Math and the number of students who received an A in only History.**\n\n```\n9 + 3 = 12 students\n```\n\n**Step 4: Subtract the total number of students who received an A in either Math or History from the total number of students in the class.**\n\n```\n30 - 12 = 18 students\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$18$}.

        "ground_truth": "Adding the numbers of students with A's in history and math gives $7+13 = 20$.  But this counts the 4 kids who got A's in both twice, so there are $20-4=16$ different students total who received an A in at least one of the courses.  That leaves $30-16=\\boxed{14}$ who didn't get an A in either."
