        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of 128, 144 and 480?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of 128 is \\(2^7\\).\nThe prime factorization of 144 is \\(2^4\\cdot 3^2\\).\nThe prime factorization of 480 is \\(2^5\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\).\nThe greatest common divisor is the product of the common prime factors raised to the lowest power.\nThe common prime factors are \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).\nThe lowest power of \\(2\\) is \\(2^4\\).\nThe lowest power of \\(3\\) is \\(3\\).\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor is \\(2^4\\cdot 3 = 48\\).\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{48}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$128=2^7$ and $144=12^2=2^4 \\cdot 3^2,$ so the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is at most $2^4=16$. In fact, $480$ is divisible by $16,$ so $\\boxed{16}$ is the greatest common divisor of the three numbers."
