At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800. What is the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides?",
        "inference": "The degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is given by $180(n - 2)$.\n\nSo, the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides is $180(n + 2 - 2) = 180n$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{180n}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  Therefore,  \\[\n180(n-2)=1800 \\implies n=12.\n\\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\\circ(14-2)=\\boxed{2160}$ degrees."
