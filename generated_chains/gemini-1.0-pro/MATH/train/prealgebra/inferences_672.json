At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA designer has 3 fabric colors he may use for a dress: red, green, and blue. Four different patterns are available for the dress. If each dress design requires exactly one color and one pattern, how many different dress designs are possible?",
        "inference": "Each of the 3 colors can be combined with each of the 4 patterns, for a total of 3 x 4 = 12  different dress designs.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For each fabric color, the designer can choose one of four patterns. Thus, as there are three potential fabric colors, the designer can create $3 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{12}$ different dress designs."
