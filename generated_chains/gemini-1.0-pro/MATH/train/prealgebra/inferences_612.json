At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFrom point $A$, Leigh walked 40 yards south, 60 yards west, 10 yards north, and 20 yards east to point $B$. What is the length, in yards, of $\\overline{AB}$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION:**\n\n1. Plot point $A$ on a coordinate plane, and let it be the origin $$(0,0)$$.\n\n2. Move 40 yards south, which corresponds to subtracting $40$ from the $y$-coordinate: $$(0,-40)$$.\n\n3. Move 60 yards west, which corresponds to subtracting $60$ from the $x$-coordinate: $$-60,-40)$$.\n\n4. Move 10 yards north, which corresponds to adding $10$ to the $y$-coordinate: $$-60  -30)$$.\n\n5. Move 20 yards east, which corresponds to adding $20$ to the $x$-coordinate: $$-40 -30)$$.\n\n6. This final point is point $B$.\n\n7. Use the distance formula to find the length of $\\overline{AB}$:\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\sqrt{(-40-0)^2+(-30-0)^2}$$\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\sqrt{(-40)^2+(-30)^2}$$\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\sqrt{1600+900}$$\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\sqrt{2500}$$\n\n$$|\\overline{AB}|=\\boxed{50}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$50$}.

        "ground_truth": "Keep up with the north-south movement separately from the east-west movement.  Leigh goes 40 yards south and 10 yards north, so she ends up 30 yards south of her starting position.  She goes 60 yards west and 20 yards east for a net east-west displacement of 40 yards west.  Going 30 yards south and 40 yards west puts Leigh $\\sqrt{30^2+40^2}=\\boxed{50}$ yards away."
