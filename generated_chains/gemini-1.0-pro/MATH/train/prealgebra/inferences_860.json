If the measure of angle $A$ is 40 degrees less than the measure of angle $D$, what is the measure of angle $D$?",

Given that the measure of angle \\(A\\) is 40 degrees less than the measure of angle \\(D\\), the measure of angle \\(A\\) will be:\n$$Angle\\ A=x-40$$\n\nSince angles \\(A, B, \\) and \\(C\\) are congruent, we have:\n$$Angle\\ B=Angle\\ C=Angle\\ A=x-40$$\n\nSum of interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees.

        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of $\\angle A$ be $x$, so we have $\\angle B = x$ and $\\angle C=x$, too.

The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we have \\[x + x + x + (x+40^\\circ) + (x+40^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x + 80^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, so $5x = 460^\\circ$ and $x = 92^\\circ$.
