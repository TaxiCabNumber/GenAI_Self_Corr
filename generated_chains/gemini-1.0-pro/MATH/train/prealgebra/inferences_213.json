At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGage skated 1 hr 15 min each day for 5 days and 1 hr 30 min each day for 3 days.  How many minutes would he have to skate the ninth day in order to average 85 minutes of skating each day for the entire time?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the time to minutes\n1 hr 15 min = 75 minutes\n1 hr 30 min = 90 minutes\n\n**Step 2:** Find the total time Gage skated for 8 days\n75 minutes x 5 days + 90 minutes x 3 days = 675 minutes\n\n**Step 3:** Find the average time for 9 days\n85 minutes x 9 days = 765 minutes\n\n**Step 4:** Find the difference between the time needed for 9 days and the time Gage already skated for 8 days\n765 minutes - 675 minutes = 90 minutes\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$90$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In 5 days, Gage skated for $5 \\times 75 =375$ minutes, and in 3 days he skated for $3 \\times 90 = 270$ minutes.  So, in 8 days he skated for $375 + 270 = 645$ minutes.  To average 85 minutes per day for 9 days he must skate $9 \\times 85 = 765$ minutes, so he must skate $765-645=\\boxed{120}$ minutes = 2 hours the ninth day."
