At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA burger at Ricky C's weighs 120 grams, of which 30 grams are filler.  What percent of the burger is not filler?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the weight of the burger without the filler, which is $120 - 30 = 90$ grams. Then, we can find the percent of the burger that is not filler by dividing the weight of the burger without the filler by the total weight of the burger and multiplying by 100, which is $\\frac{90}{120} \\times 100 = 75\\%$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{75}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $120 - 30 = 90$ grams that are not filler.  So $\\frac{90}{120} = \\boxed{75\\%}$ is not filler."
