At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix positive integers from a list of nine positive integers are $6, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5$. What is the largest possible value of the median of this list of nine positive integers?",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we sort the numbers, we get $2,4,5,6,7,8$. If we want to maximize the median, we should add three numbers larger than 8. This makes the median $\\boxed{7}$."
