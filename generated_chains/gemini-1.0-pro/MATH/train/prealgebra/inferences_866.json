At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a triangle is 600 square feet. Find the altitude, in feet, of the triangle if the length of the corresponding base is 30 feet.",
        "inference": "The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the altitude.\n\nTherefore, to find the altitude, we can rearrange the formula to $h = \\frac{2A}{b}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get $h = \\frac{2 \\cdot 600}{30} = 40$.\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the triangle is 40 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the area of a triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the altitude of the triangle. Since we know that the area of the triangles is $600$ sq. feet and the base is $30$ feet, we have that $600 = \\frac{1}{2} (30)h$, so $600=15h$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $15$, we have that $h=40$. The altitude of the triangle is $\\boxed{40}$ feet."
