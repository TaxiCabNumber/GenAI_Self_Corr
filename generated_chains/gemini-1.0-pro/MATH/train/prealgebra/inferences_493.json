At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn writing the integers from 10 through 99 inclusive, how many times is the digit 6 written?",

I hope it is correct.",

In total, there are $10+9=\\boxed{19}$ appearances of the digit 6.\n\nNote: This question asks for the number of times the digit 6 is written, not the number of numbers with the digit 6."
