At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a circle is $49\\pi$ square units. What is the radius of the circle, in units?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius.\n\nWe are given that $A = 49\\pi$, so we can substitute this into the formula to get:\n\n$$49\\pi = \\pi r^2$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get:\n\n$$49 = r^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$r = 7$$\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$7$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since the area of a circle is $\\pi \\cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot r^2 = 49\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\\boxed{7}$ units."
