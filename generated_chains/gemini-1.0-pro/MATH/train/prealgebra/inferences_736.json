At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe U.S. produces about 5.5 million tons of apples each year. Of the total, $20\\%$ is mixed with other products, with $50\\%$ of the remainder used for apple juice and the other $50\\%$ sold fresh. How many million tons of apples are used for apple juice? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "- Of the 5.5 million tons of apples produced, $20\\%$ is mixed with other products, which is $0.20 \\times 5.5 = 1.1$ million tons.\n- Of the remaining 4.4 million tons of apples, $50\\%$ is used for apple juice, which is $0.50 \\times 4.4 = 2.2$ million tons.\n- Therefore, the number of million tons of apples used for apple juice is $\\boxed{2.2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we wish to determine what percentage of the tons of apples are used for apple juice. After $20\\%$ is mixed with other products, $80\\%$ remains. Half of this is used for apple juice; therefore, $40\\%$ of the tons of apples is used for apple juice. To calculate $40\\%$ of $5.5$ million tons, we find $10\\%$ and then multiply by four. $10\\% = 0.55$, and $0.55 \\cdot 4 = 2.2$. Thus, $\\boxed{2.2}$ million tons are used for apple juice."
