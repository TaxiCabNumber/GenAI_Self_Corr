At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of girls to boys in Ms. Snow's math class is 3:2. If there is a total of 45 students, how many girls are in Ms. Snow's math class?",
        "inference": "First, let's find the total number of parts by adding the ratio of girls to the ratio of boys:\n\n$$3 + 2 = 5$$\n\nNow, let's divide the total number of students by the total number of parts to find the number of students per part:\n\n$$45 \\div 5 = 9$$\n\nFinally, let's multiply the number of students per part by the ratio of girls to find the number of girls in the class:\n\n$$9 \\times 3 = 27$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $3k$ girls in Ms. Snow's class, then there are $2k$ boys.  Since the total number of students is $45$, we solve $2k+3k=45$ to find $k=45/5=9$.   There are $3k=3(9)=\\boxed{27}$ girls in the class."
