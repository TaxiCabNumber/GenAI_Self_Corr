At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes?  (Note: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards as backwards.)",
        "inference": "The greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes is the number that is a factor of all one-digit numbers, which is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Palindromes are numbers whose digits read from left to right and from right to left result in the same number. All two-digit palindromes (11, 22,...99) can be factored into 11 and a number between 1 and 9. The only factor that all of them share is $\\boxed{11}$, so that is our answer."
