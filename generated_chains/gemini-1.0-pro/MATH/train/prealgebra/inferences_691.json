        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many digits does the smallest repeating block in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ contain?",
        "inference": "The decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is obtained by dividing 5 by 7. Since 7 is a prime number, the division will not terminate and the decimal expansion will be non-terminating recurring.\n\nThe smallest repeating block in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is the block that repeats after the decimal point. To find the length of this block, we need to find the remainder when 5 is divided by 7.\n\n$$5 \\div 7 = 0 \\text{ remainder } 5$$\n\nSo the remainder is 5. We now need to find the remainder when 55 is divided by 7.\n\n$$55 \\div 7 = 7 \\text{ remainder } 6$$\n\nSo the remainder is 6. We now need to find the remainder when 556 is divided by 7.\n\n$$556 \\div 7 = 79 \\text{ remainder } 3$$\n\nSo the remainder is 3. We now need to find the remainder when 5563 is divided by 7.\n\n$$5563 \\div 7 = 794 \\text{ remainder } 5$$\n\nSo the remainder is 5. We have now come back to the original remainder, so the smallest repeating block in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is the block 556.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which is a repeating block of $\\boxed{6}$ digits."
