At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree positive integers have an arithmetic mean of 26 and median of 27. If the median is 5 less than the largest number, what is the smallest number?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet the three numbers be $x$, $y$, and $z$. Then, we have the following equations:\n\n$$\\frac{x+y+z}{3} = 26 \\Rightarrow x+y+z = 78$$\n\n$$y = 27$$\n\n$$z = y+5 = 32$$\n\nSubstituting $y$ and $z$ into $x+y+z = 78$, we get:\n\n$$x = 78 - y - z = 78 - 27 - 32 = 19$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{19}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The median of three integers is the middle integer. So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$. We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\\times3=78$. We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\\boxed{19}$."
