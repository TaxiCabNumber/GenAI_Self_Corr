At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe arithmetic mean of these five expressions is 24.

        "ground_truth": "Since the arithmetic mean of these expressions is 24, we can write the expression for the mean: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{(x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)}{5}&=24\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x+8)+15+(2x)+13+(2x+4)&=5\\cdot 24\n\\end{align*}\n\nCombining like terms on the left, we find $5x+40=120$, so $5x=80$, from which we have $x=16$.
