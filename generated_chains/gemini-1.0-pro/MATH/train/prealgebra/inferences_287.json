        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sorcerer is concocting a healing potion. In order to do so, he must have one of three roots, and one of five minerals. However, one of the minerals is incompatible with two of the roots. Otherwise, he does not foresee any complications with other combinations of roots and minerals. In how many ways can he brew his potion?",
        "inference": "The sorcerer has three choices for the root and five choices for the mineral.  However, one of the minerals is incompatible with two of the roots.  So, the sorcerer has three choices for the root and four choices for the mineral.  Therefore, the sorcerer can brew his potion in $3 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{12}$ ways.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are three roots and five minerals, meaning $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$ possible combinations of roots and minerals. However, two of them are not valid, therefore there are $15 - 2 = \\boxed{13}$ possible ways in which the sorcerer can brew his potion."
