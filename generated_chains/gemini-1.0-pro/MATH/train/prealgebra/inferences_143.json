At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the multiples of $20$ that are $3$-digit numbers. The smallest $3$-digit multiple of $20$ is $100$, and the largest is $980$.  So, there are $\\frac{980-100}{20}+1 = 45$ multiples of $20$ that are $3$-digit numbers.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the multiples of $55$ that are $3$-digit numbers. The smallest $3$-digit multiple of $55$ is $110$, and the largest is $990$.  So, there are $\\frac{990-110}{55}+1 = 16$ multiples of $55$ that are $3$-digit numbers.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the number of multiples of $55$ from the number of multiples of $20$ to find the number of multiples of $20$ that are not multiples of $55$.  $45-16 = 29$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{29}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The $3$-digit multiples of $20$ are $$100, 120, 140, 160, \\ldots, 960, 980.$$ To form the numbers in this list, we can choose any of $9$ hundreds digits and any of $5$ tens digits (but we have only one option for the units digit, which must be $0$). So, there are $9\\cdot 5 = 45$ multiples of $20$ in our list. However, we want to exclude those which are also multiples of $55$.\n\nThe least common multiple of $20$ and $55$ is $220$, so we have to exclude the multiples of $220$ from our list. There are four such numbers: $220$, $440$, $660$, and $880$. This leaves $45-4 = \\boxed{41}$ three-digit multiples of $20$ which are not multiples of $55$."
