At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the three side lengths is 1800.  What is the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle?",
        "inference": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the lengths of the three sides of the right-angled triangle. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have\n$$a^2+b^2=c^2.$$Since the sum of the squares of the three side lengths is 1800, we have\n$$a^2+b^2+c^2=1800.$$Substituting the Pythagorean Theorem into this equation, we get\n$$a^2+b^2+c^2=a^2+b^2+c^2.$$Simplifying, we get\n$$c^2=1800.$$Taking the square root of both sides, we get\n$$c=\\sqrt{1800}=6\\sqrt{50}.$$Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{50}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{50}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose the side lengths of the triangle are $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c$ the hypotenuse. Then $c^2 = a^2+b^2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. We are told that $$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1800.$$ Since $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$ or $2c^2 = 1800$ or $c^2 = 900$ or $c=30$ (since the side lengths are positive). So the hypotenuse has length $\\boxed{30}$."
