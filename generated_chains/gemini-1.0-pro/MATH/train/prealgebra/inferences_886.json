At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn assortment of 200 pencils is sold through a catalog for $\\$19.90$. Shipping is an additional $\\$6.95$. Including the charges for both the pencils and the shipping, what is the average cost, in cents, for each pencil? Express your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "Total cost = $\\$19.90 + $6.95 = $26.85\n\nAverage cost per pencil = $26.85 / 200 pencils = $0.13425\n\nRounded to the nearest whole number: 13 cents\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils. The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils. Thus, the average cost is $\\frac{2685}{200}\\approx\\boxed{13}$ cents."
