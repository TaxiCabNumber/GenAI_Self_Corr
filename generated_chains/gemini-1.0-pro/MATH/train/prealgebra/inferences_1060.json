        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what digit $d$ is the five-digit number $2345d$ a multiple of 9?",
        "inference": "The sum of the digits of 2345d is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + d = 14 + d. For 2345d to be a multiple of 9, 14 + d must be a multiple of 9. The only digit that makes 14 + d a multiple of 9 is d = 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+3+4+5=14$, the only single digit that will make the sum a multiple of 9 is $4$. The sum of the digits would be $18$, which is $9\\cdot 2$, so $d=\\boxed{4}$."
