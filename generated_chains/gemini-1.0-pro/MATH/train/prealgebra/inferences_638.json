At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the ten letters in ``MATHCOUNTS'' is written on its own square tile and placed in a bag. What is the probability that a tile randomly selected from the bag will have a letter on it that is in the word ``TEACH''? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are ten letters in the bag. Four of these letters are in the word TEACH. So, the probability of choosing a letter in the word TEACH is 4 / 10.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{2/5}. I hope it is correct.**",
