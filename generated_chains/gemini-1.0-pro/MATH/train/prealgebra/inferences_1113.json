        "ground_truth": "The prime factorizations of these integers are $154 =2\\cdot7\\cdot11$ and $252=2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot7$. The prime factorization of their greatest common divisor (GCD) must include all of the primes that their factorizations have in common, taken as many times as both factorizations allow.
