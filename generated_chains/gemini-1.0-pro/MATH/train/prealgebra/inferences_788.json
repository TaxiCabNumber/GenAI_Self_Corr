        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive two-digit integers are multiples of 5 and of 7?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nMultiples of 5 are of the form $5k$, where $k$ is an integer.\nMultiples of 7 are of the form $7l$, where $l$ is an integer.\nWe want to find the number of positive two-digit integers that are multiples of both 5 and 7. These are of the form $35m$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\nThe smallest positive two-digit multiple of 35 is $35\\times 2 = 70$.\nThe largest positive two-digit multiple of 35 is $35\\times 9 = 315$.\nThere are $9 - 2 + 1 = 8$ positive two-digit multiples of 35.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 5 and 7 share no factors other than 1, any number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 must be a multiple of $5\\cdot7=35$. Thus, we want to find how many 2-digit integers are multiples of 35. The only two-digit multiples of 35 are 35 and 70, so our answer is $\\boxed{2}$ integers."
