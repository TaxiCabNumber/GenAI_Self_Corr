At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChandra has four bowls.  Each one is a different color (red, blue, yellow, green).  She also has exactly one glass the same color as each bowl.  If she chooses a bowl and a glass from the cupboard, how many pairings are possible?  One such pairing is a blue bowl and a yellow glass.",
        "inference": "Each bowl can be paired with any one of the four glasses, so there are 4 possible pairings for each bowl. Since there are 4 bowls, there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 possible pairings.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$16$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four different bowls and four different glasses that Chandra can pick. Since her choices are mutually exclusive, there are $4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{16}$ possible pairings."
