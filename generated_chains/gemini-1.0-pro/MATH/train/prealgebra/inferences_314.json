At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nApartment rentals in Fairview run $\\$$0.90 per square foot. Jillian has determined that she can afford $\\$$630 per month for rent. What is the largest apartment, in square feet, she should consider at the given rate?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Convert the monthly rent to a daily rent: $630/30 = 21$\n2. Divide the daily rent by the cost per square foot: $21/0.90 = 23.33$ (rounded up)\n3. **Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{$23$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the size of the apartment be $s$.  The cost will be $0.9s$.  The maximum comes when this is $630$, so\n\n$$630=0.9s\\Rightarrow s=\\boxed{700}$$\n\nsquare feet."
