At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numerical value of a particular square's area is equal to the numerical value of its perimeter. What is the length of a side of the square?",
        "inference": "Let x be the length of a side of the square.\nThe area of the square is x^2.\nThe perimeter of the square is 4x.\nWe are given that the area is equal to the perimeter, so:\nx^2 = 4x\nx^2 - 4x = 0\nx(x - 4) = 0\nx = 0 or x = 4\nSince the length of a side of a square cannot be 0, we have x = 4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
