At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $87^{\\mathrm{th}}$ odd positive integer?",

To find the nth odd positive integer, we can use the formula $2n-1$. \n\nFor the 87th odd positive integer, n = 87.\nSo, the 87th odd positive integer is $2(87)-1 = 173$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{173}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every odd positive integer can be expressed in the form $2x - 1$, where $x$ is a positive integer greater than or equal to $1$. When $x = 1$, the formula yields the first odd positive integer, $1$. When $x = 2$, the formula gives the second odd positive integer, $3$. Thus, the $87$th odd positive integer will be $2 \\cdot 87 - 1 = \\boxed{173}$."
