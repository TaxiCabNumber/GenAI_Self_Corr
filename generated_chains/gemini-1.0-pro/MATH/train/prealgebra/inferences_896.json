        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 18 miles north, then 11 miles west, then 6 miles south and finally 6 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the net displacement in the north-south direction:\n18 miles north - 6 miles south = 12 miles north\n\n2. Calculate the net displacement in the east-west direction:\n11 miles west - 6 miles east = 5 miles west\n\n3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the net displacement:\n$\\sqrt{(12)^2+(5)^2}=\\sqrt{144+25}=\\sqrt{169}=13$ miles\n\n4. Round the answer to the nearest mile:\n13 miles\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In total, the traveler went 12 miles north and 5 miles west. This forms a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{13}$ miles away from the starting point."
