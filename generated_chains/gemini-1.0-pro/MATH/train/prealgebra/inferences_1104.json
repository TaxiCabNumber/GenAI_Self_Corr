At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe figure shows three squares with non-overlapping interiors. The area of the shaded square is 1 square inch.

        "inference": "The area of the shaded square is 1 square inch, and the shaded square has sides of length 1 inch. The length of the rectangle is 1 inch greater than the length of the shaded square, and the width of the rectangle is 2 inches. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:\n\n$$Area = length * width = (1+1) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4 square inches.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The two small squares on the left-hand side both have side length $1$, so both have area $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. The larger square on the right has side length twice that of one of the smaller squares, giving it a side length of $2$ and an area of $4$. Thus, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $1 + 1 + 4 = \\boxed{6}$ square inches."
