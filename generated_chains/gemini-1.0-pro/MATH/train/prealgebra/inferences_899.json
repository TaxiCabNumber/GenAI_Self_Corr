At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest five-digit integer whose digits have a product equal to the product $(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe largest five-digit integer is $98765$. The product of its digits is $9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 = 15120$. Since $15120$ is not equal to $(7)(6)(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 5040$, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since we want a large 5-digit integer, we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. We prime factorize the product to get $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 2^4$. The largest single-digit number is $9$, which can be found by $3^2$. This leaves us $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2^4$. We can get the next largest number, $8$, by using $2^3$. This leaves $7 \\cdot 5\\cdot 2$. We can't multiply any of those numbers together to get a single-digit number, so we have that the remaining three digits are $7,5$, and $2$. Ordering the digits from largest to smallest, we get $\\boxed{98752}$."
