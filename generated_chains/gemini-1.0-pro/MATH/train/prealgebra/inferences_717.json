At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Mrs. Marsh's algebra class, 30 of the 36 students took the Chapter 4 test, and their mean score was $72 \\%$. The next day the other six students took the test and their mean score was $78 \\%$. What is the new class mean? Express your answer as a percent.",

Find the total score of all 36 students: $21.6 + 4.68 = 26.28$\n4. Find the new class mean: $26.28 / 36 = 0.73$\n5. Express the new class mean as a percent: $0.73 \\cdot 100 = 73 \\%$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$73$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To make this easier, you can scale all the student numbers down by a factor of 6: 5 students averaged a $72\\%$, and 1 student got a $78\\%$.  Then, instead of adding that up, you note, since 5 students averaged a 72, and only 1 student got a 78, the class average should be 5 times closer to 72 than 78.  And since $78 - 72 = 6$, we perfectly get $\\boxed{73\\%}$ as the class average, since $73 - 72 = 1$, and $78 - 73 = 5$."
