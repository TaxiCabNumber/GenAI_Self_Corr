At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI flip a fair coin once and roll a regular six-sided die.  What is the probability the coin will show heads and the die will show a 2?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the probability of flipping heads on the coin.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes for flipping a coin: heads or tails. Since the coin is fair, the probability of flipping heads is 1/2.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the probability of rolling a 2 on the die.\n\nThere are six possible outcomes for rolling a six-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the die is regular, each outcome is equally likely. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the probabilities to find the joint probability.\n\nThe probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, the probability of flipping heads on the coin and rolling a 2 on the die is:\n\n```\nP(heads and 2) = P(heads) * P(2) = (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1/12}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 2 possible outcomes for the coin and 6 possible outcomes for the die, so there are $2 \\times 6 = 12$ equally likely outcomes.  Only 1 of these is a successful outcome: the coin must show heads and the die must show 2.  So the probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
