        "inference": "The greatest common multiple (GCM) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. To find the GCM of 8 and 12, we can first find the prime factorizations of each number:\n\n$$8 = 2^3$$\n\n$$12 = 2^2 \\times 3$$\n\nThe GCM of 8 and 12 is the product of the common prime factors, which in this case is $2^2$. Therefore, the GCM of 8 and 12 is $4$.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the greatest common multiple that is less than 90.

        "ground_truth": "Recall that the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple of the set. In this case, the common multiples are integers of the form $24k$ (where $k$ is an integer), since 24 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12. Since $24(3)=72$ and $24(4)=96>90$, the greatest common multiple of 8 and 12 less than 90 is $\\boxed{72}$."
