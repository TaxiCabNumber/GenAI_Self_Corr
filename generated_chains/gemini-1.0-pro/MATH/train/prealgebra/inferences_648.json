At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA convex pentagon has interior angles with measures $x+1$, $2x$, $3x$, $4x$, and $5x-1$ degrees.  What is the measure of the largest angle?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a convex pentagon is $540^\\circ$.  So, we have\n\n$$(x+1)+(2x)+(3x)+(4x)+(5x-1)=540$$\n\nSimplifying, we get\n\n$$15x=539$$\n\nDividing both sides by $15$, we get\n\n$$x=35.93$$\n\nSo, the largest angle is $5x-1=5(35.93)-1=\\boxed{179.65}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{179.65}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles of this pentagon is $(5-2)\\cdot180=540$ degrees. Thus, we have the equation $540=(x+1)+2x+3x+4x+(5x-1)\\Rightarrow 540 = 15x \\Rightarrow x=36$. The largest angle has measure $5x-1$, or $5\\cdot36-1=\\boxed{179}$ degrees."
