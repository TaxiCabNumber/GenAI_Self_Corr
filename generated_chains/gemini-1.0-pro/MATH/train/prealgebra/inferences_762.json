        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a positive integer which reads the same forward and backward, like $12321$ or $4884$.\n\nHow many $4$-digit palindromes are there?",
        "inference": "First, note that a $4$-digit palindrome is of the form $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$ for some digits $a, b, c, d$.\n\nSince $d$ can be any digit from $0$ to $9$, there are $10$ choices for $d$.\n\nNext, $c$ can be any digit from $0$ to $9$, but it must be the same as $d$. So there are $10$ choices for $c$.\n\nNow, $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $9$, but it must be the same as $c$ and $d$. So there are $10$ choices for $b$.\n\nFinally, $a$ can be any digit from $1$ to $9$, since $0$ is not allowed as the first digit of a $4$-digit number. So there are $9$ choices for $a$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of $4$-digit palindromes is $10 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{9000}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the other two digits are automatically chosen. Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number. There are $90$ two-digit numbers ($10$ through $99$). Accordingly, there are also $\\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes."
