At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has a side of length 6 cm, a side of length 8 cm and a right angle. What is the shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle? Express your answer in centimeters as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
