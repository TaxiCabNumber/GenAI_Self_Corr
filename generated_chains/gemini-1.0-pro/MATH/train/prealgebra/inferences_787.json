At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarty wants to paint a box.  He can choose to use either blue, green, yellow, or black paint.  Also, he can style the paint by painting with a brush, a roller, or a sponge.  How many different combinations of color and painting method can Marty choose?",
        "inference": "There are 4 options for the color and 3 options for the painting method.  So, there are $4 \\times 3 = 12$ different combinations of color and painting method.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Marty can choose his paint in 4 ways and his style in 3 ways.  Thus there are a total of $4\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ different combinations he can choose."
