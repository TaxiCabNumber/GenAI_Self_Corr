At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n12 balls numbered 1 through 12 are placed in a bin.  Joe produces a list of three numbers by performing the following sequence three times:  he chooses a ball, records the number, and places the ball back in the bin.   How many different lists are possible?",
        "inference": "Since each of the three numbers can be any of the numbers 1 through 12, there are $12\\cdot 12 \\cdot 12 = 1728$ different lists possible.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 options for each ball to be drawn, so there are a total of $12^3 = \\boxed{1728}$ possible drawings."
