At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo points are drawn on each side of a square with an area of 81 square units, dividing the side into 3 congruent parts.  Quarter-circle arcs connect the points on adjacent sides to create the figure shown.  What is the length of the boundary of the bolded figure?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

        "ground_truth": "Since the square has area 81 square units, it must have side length $\\sqrt{81}=9$ units (all number lengths will be in units henceforth). The boundary consists of four straight segments of length $9/3=3$ and four quarter-circle arc segments.  Notice how the four quarter-circle arc segments comprise a full circle of radius $3$; thus their total length is equal to that of the circumference of a circle of radius $3$, which is $6\\pi$.  The total length of the four straight segments is simply $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$.  Hence the total length of both type of segments is $6\\pi + 12$, which is approximately 30.84956.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{30.8}$."
