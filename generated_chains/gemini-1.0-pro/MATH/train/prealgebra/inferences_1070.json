At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the measures of the acute angles of a right triangle is $8:1$. In degrees, what is the measure of the largest angle of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of the smaller acute angle. Then the measure of the larger acute angle is $8x$.\n\nThe sum of the three angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n$$x + 8x + 90 = 180$$Solving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$9x = 90$$Dividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\n$$x = 10$$Therefore, the measure of the larger acute angle is $8x = \\boxed{80}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$80$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The actual degree measures of the acute angles don't matter. A right triangle consists of a right angle of $90^\\circ$ and two acute angles that add up to $90^\\circ$, so each of the two acute angles is smaller than the right angle. Also recall that the definition of an acute angle is that its degree measure is less than $90^\\circ$. So the largest angle of the triangle is the right angle, which has a measure of $\\boxed{90^\\circ}$."
