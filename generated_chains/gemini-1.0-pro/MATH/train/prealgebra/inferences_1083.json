At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Beaumont High School, there are 20 players on the basketball team.  All 20 players are taking at least one of biology or chemistry.  (Biology and chemistry are two different science courses at the school.)  If there are 8 players taking biology and 4 players are taking both sciences, how many players are taking chemistry?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of players taking biology only.\n* If the number of players taking both sciences is 4, then the number of players taking biology only is:\n* 8 (taking biology) - 4 (taking both sciences) = 4 (taking biology only)\n\n**Step 2:** Find the total number of players taking chemistry.\n* Since all 20 players are taking at least one of biology or chemistry, the number of players taking chemistry is the total number of players minus the number of players taking biology:\n* 20 (total players) - 4 (taking biology only) = 16 (taking chemistry)\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$16$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "8 players are taking biology, so $20 - 8 = 12$ players are not taking biology, which means 12 players are taking chemistry alone.  Since 4 are taking both, there are $12 + 4 = \\boxed{16}$ players taking chemistry."
