At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA set of three numbers has both a mean and median equal to 4. If the smallest number in the set is 1, what is the range of the set of numbers?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the sum of the numbers in the set. Since there are three numbers, the sum of the numbers is 3 x 4 = 12.\n\n**Step 2:** Since the smallest number in the set is 1, the other two numbers must sum to 11.\n\n**Step 3:** There are two possibilities for the other two numbers: 2 and 9, or 5 and 6.\n\n**Step 4:** The range is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the set. For the set {1, 2, 9}, the range is 9 - 1 = 8.\nFor the set {1, 5, 6}, the range is 6 - 1 = 5.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the mean of three numbers is 4, then their sum is 12.  Since two of the numbers are 1 and 4, the third number is $12-(1+4)=7$.  The range, which is the difference between the smallest and largest numbers, is $7-1=\\boxed{6}$."
