        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
        "inference": "If the original price is $x$, the sale price is $x-0.30x=0.70x$, and the final price is $0.70x-0.20(0.70x)=0.56x$.\n\nThe true discount is $x-0.56x=0.44x$, and the merchant's claimed discount is $x-0.50x=0.50x$.\n\nThe difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount is $0.44x-0.50x=-0.06x$.\n\nAs a percentage of the original price, this difference is $\\frac{-0.06x}{x}=-0.06=-6\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
