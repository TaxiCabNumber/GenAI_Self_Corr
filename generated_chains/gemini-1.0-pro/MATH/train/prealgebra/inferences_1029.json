        "ground_truth": "Recall that we must perform the operations inside the parentheses first.  So, we must simplify $10+11\\cdot 2$ first.  Of these operations, we must do the multiplication and then the addition because multiplication and division must be done before addition and subtraction.  We get \\begin{align*}10+11\\cdot 2 &=10+22 \\\\ &=32.\\end{align*}Now, we substitute back into the original expression and do the division.
