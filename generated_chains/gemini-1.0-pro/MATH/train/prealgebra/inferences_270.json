At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Friday, a snowboard originally priced at $\\$100$ was discounted $50\\%$. On Monday, that sale price was reduced by $30\\%$. In dollars, what is the price of the snowboard after the Monday reduction?",
        "inference": "1. Find the price after the Friday Discount:\nPrice after Friday Discount = Original Price - Discount (in dollars)\n= $100 - (50/100) \u00d7 $100\n= $100 - $50\n= $50\n\n2. Find the discount on Monday:\nDiscount on Monday = (30/100) \u00d7 Sale Price on Friday\n= (30/100) \u00d7 $50\n= $15\n\n3. Find the price after the Monday reduction:\nPrice after Monday Reduction = Sale Price on Friday - Discount on Monday\n= $50 - $15\n= $35\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$35}$. I hope it is correct.",
