At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a bag with only red, blue, and green marbles.  The ratio of red marbles to blue marbles to green marbles is $1:5:3$.  There are 27 green marbles in the bag.  How many marbles are there  in the bag?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let's represent the number of red marbles with $x$,  number of blue marbles with $5x$, and the number of green marbles with $3x$.\n\n**Step 2**: Since there are 27 green marbles, we can write $3x=27$.\n\n**Step 3**: Solving for $x$, we get $x=9$.\n\n**Step 4**: Therefore, the number of red marbles is $x=9$, the number of blue marbles is $5x=45$, and the number of green marbles is $3x=27$.\n\n**Step 5**: The total number of marbles in the bag is $9+45+27=\\boxed{81}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{81}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of red to blue to green marbles is $1:5:3$, the ratio of green marbles to the total number of marbles is $3/(1+5+3) = 3/9=1/3$.  Since the green marbles are one-third of the total, and there are 27 green marbles, there must be $3\\cdot 27 = \\boxed{81}$ total marbles."
