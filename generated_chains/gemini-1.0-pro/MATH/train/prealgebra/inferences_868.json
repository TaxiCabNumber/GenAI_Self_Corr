At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe value of $\\sqrt{73}$ is between two positive, consecutive integers. What is the product of these two integers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two consecutive integers n and n + 1. We know that $\\sqrt{73}$ is between n and n + 1, so we have $n < \\sqrt{73} < n + 1$. Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get $n^2 < 73 < (n + 1)^2$. We also know that $n^2 < 73 < n^2 + 2n + 1$. So, we have $n^2 < 73 < n^2 + 2n + 1$. Subtracting $n^2$ from all sides, we get $0 < 73 < 2n + 1$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $-1 < 72 < 2n$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $-\\frac{1}{2} < 36 < n$. Since n is a positive integer, we have $n = 36$. So, the two consecutive integers are 36 and 37. The product of these two integers is $36 \\times 37 = \\boxed{1332}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1332}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $73$ is between $64=8^{2}$ and $81=9^{2}$, we know that $\\sqrt{73}$ is between $8$ and $9.$ Our answer is $8\\cdot9=\\boxed{72}.$"
