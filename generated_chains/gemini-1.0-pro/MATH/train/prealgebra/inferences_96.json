At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same?",
        "inference": "There are 16 possible outcomes when you flip four coins:\n```\nHHHH\nHHHT\nHHTH\nHTHH\nHTTH\nTHHT\nTHHH\nTTHH\nTHTH\nTTHT\nHTTT\nHHTT\nTHTT\nTTTT\n```\n\nThe penny and the dime can both come up heads or both come up tails.  There are 4 outcomes in which both come up heads, and 4 outcomes in which both come up tails, for a total of 8 outcomes.\n\nThe probability that the penny and the dime both come up the same is 8/16, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{1/2}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails).  There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails.  There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter.  So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{8}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
