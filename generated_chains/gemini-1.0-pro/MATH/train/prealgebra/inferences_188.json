At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct arrangements of the letters in the word \"monkey\"' are there?",
        "inference": "The word \"monkey\" has 6 letters. To arrange these letters, we can use the formula for permutations:\n\nPermutation (nPr) = n! / (n - r)!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be arranged.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and r = 6, so the number of distinct arrangements is:\n\nPermutation (6P6) = 6! / (6 - 6)!\n= 6! / 1!\n= 6!\n= 720\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{720}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's consider building such an arrangement.  We can choose the first letter in 6 ways.  After we have chosen the first letter, we can choose the second in 5 ways.  Similarly, the third letter then has 4 ways of being chosen, the next letter 3, the next 2, and the last only 1.  Thus the total number of arrangements is $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{720}$."
