        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFiona is people-watching again. She spies a group of ten high schoolers and starts playing a game by herself, in which she looks at a pair of people from the group of ten and tries to guess whether they like or dislike each other. How many pairs of friends can she observe before she runs out of pairs to evaluate?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of pairs of people in a group of 10.  _10 people can be paired in 10C2 ways._\n> _10C2 = 10! / [(2!)(10-2)!] = 45_\n**Step 2:** The total number of pairs of people that Fiona can observe is **45**.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{45}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $10$ options for the first person and $9$ options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $10 \\cdot 9 = 90$ pairs. However, the order in which Fiona chooses the people doesn't matter, and we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9}{2}=\\boxed{45}$ pairs of friends."
