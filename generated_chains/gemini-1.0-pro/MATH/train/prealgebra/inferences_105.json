At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a state contest, 21 Mathletes stay in the same hotel. Each Mathlete gets his/her own room and the room numbers are 1 through 21. When all the Mathletes have arrived, except the ones staying in rooms 12 and 13, what is the median room number of the other 19 Mathletes?",

So, we must first list all the room numbers of the 19 Mathletes present at the hotel.\n\n$$\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 \\rbrace$$\n\nSince there are an odd number of values, the middle value is the median.\n\n$$10 \\le \\boxed{Median} \\le 11$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
