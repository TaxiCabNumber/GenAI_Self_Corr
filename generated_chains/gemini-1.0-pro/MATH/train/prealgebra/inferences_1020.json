        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMargaret started a stamp collection. She collected 8 stamps the first day. Each subsequent day she collected 8 more stamps than she had collected the previous day. If she collected stamps for 5 consecutive days, what was the average number of stamps collected per day?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nMargaret collected 8 stamps on the first day.\nOn the second day, she collected 8 more than the previous day, so she collected $8 + 8 = 16$ stamps.\nOn the third day, she collected 8 more than the previous day, so she collected $16 + 8 = 24$ stamps.\nOn the fourth day, she collected 8 more than the previous day, so she collected $24 + 8 = 32$ stamps.\nOn the fifth day, she collected 8 more than the previous day, so she collected $32 + 8 = 40$ stamps.\n\nTo find the average number of stamps collected per day, we add up the number of stamps collected each day and divide by the number of days. So, the average number of stamps collected per day is\n\n$$(8+16+24+32+40)\\div 5 = 120\\div 5 = 24$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Consider the sequence 8, 16, 24, $\\ldots$ of the numbers of stamps collected by Margaret on successive days.  The mean of an arithmetic sequence is equal to its median, so the mean of this five-term arithmetic sequence is equal to the third term $\\boxed{24}$."
