At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe circumference of a particular circle is 18 cm. In square centimeters, what is the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference, $\\pi$ is a constant approximately equal to 3.14, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.\n\nWe are given that the circumference of the circle is 18 cm. So, we can write:\n\n$$18 = 2\\pi r$$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n\n$$r = \\frac{18}{2\\pi}$$\n\n$$r = \\frac{9}{\\pi}$$\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius.\n\nSubstituting $r = \\frac{9}{\\pi}$ into the formula, we get:\n\n$$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{9}{\\pi}\\right)^2$$\n\n$$A = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{81}{\\pi^2}$$\n\n$$A = \\frac{81}{\\pi}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{81}{\\pi}}$.
