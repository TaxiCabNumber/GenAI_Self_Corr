At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive toppings for a pizza are available at Polina's Pizza. How many combinations of two different toppings are possible?",
        "inference": "Since 2 different toppings are to be chosen, the order of selection is not material. So combination formula will be used to find the number of possible combinations. \n\nNumber of combinations = $^5$C$_2$ = $\\frac{5!}{3!  \\times  2!}$ = $\\frac{5 \\times 4}{2}$ = $10$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 options for the first topping and 4 options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $5\\cdot4=20$ options. However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{5\\cdot4}{2}=\\boxed{10}$ combinations."
