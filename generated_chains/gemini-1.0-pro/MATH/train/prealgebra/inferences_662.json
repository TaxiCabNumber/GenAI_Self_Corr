At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCaroline can make eleven lassis out of two mangoes. How many lassis can she make out of twelve mangoes?",
        "inference": "Caroline can make 55 lassis out of twelve mangoes.\n\n**Step 1: Find the number of lassis she can make out of one mango.**\n\nCaroline can make 11 lassis out of two mangoes. So, she can make 11 / 2 = 5.5 lassis out of one mango.\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the number of lassis she can make out of one mango by the number of mangoes she has.**\n\nCaroline has 12 mangoes. So, she can make 5.5 * 12 = 66 lassis out of 12 mangoes.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$66$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have $\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2$.  Multiplying both parts of the ratio by 6 gives \\[\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2 = 66:12,\\]so she can make $\\boxed{66}$ lassis."
