At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat three-digit number with units digit 2 and hundreds digit 4 is divisible by 9?",
        "inference": "1. The units digit of a number is divisible by 9 if the entire number is divisible by 9.\n2. The hundreds digit of 4 is 4. \n3. So, the number 422 is divisible by 9.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{422}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+4=6$, the only digit that will make the sum of the digits of the three-digit number divisible by 9 is $3$. Therefore, the three-digit number is $\\boxed{432}$."
