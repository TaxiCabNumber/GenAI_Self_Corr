At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo interior angles $A$ and $B$ of pentagon $ABCDE$ are $60^{\\circ}$ and $85^{\\circ}$. Two of the remaining angles, $C$ and $D$, are equal and the fifth angle $E$ is $15^{\\circ}$ more than twice $C$. Find the measure of the largest angle.",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $5\\cdot180^{\\circ}=900^{\\circ}$. Since the sum of two of the angles is $60^{\\circ}+85^{\\circ}=145^{\\circ}$, the sum of the remaining three angles is $900^{\\circ}-145^{\\circ}=755^{\\circ}$. Let $x$ be the measure of angle $C$. Then, angle $D$ is also $x$, and angle $E$ is $2x+15^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the sum of the three angles is $x+x+(2x+15^{\\circ})=4x+15^{\\circ}$. Since the sum of the three angles is $755^{\\circ}$, we have $4x+15^{\\circ}=755^{\\circ}$, which gives $4x=740^{\\circ}$, so $x=185^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the largest angle is $2x+15^{\\circ}=2(185^{\\circ})+15^{\\circ}=\\boxed{385^{\\circ}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{385^{\\circ}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the pentagon's angles is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees.\n\nLet $\\angle C$ and $\\angle D$ each have measure $x$, so $\\angle E = 2x + 15^\\circ$.  Therefore, we must have \\[60^\\circ + 85^\\circ + x + x+ 2x + 15^\\circ = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $4x + 160^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, so $4x = 380^\\circ$ and $x = 95^\\circ$.  This means the largest angle has measure $2x + 15^\\circ = 190^\\circ + 15^\\circ = \\boxed{205^\\circ}$."
