At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can a president and a 2-person committee be chosen from a group of 8 people (where the order in which we choose the 2 people doesn't matter)?  (The president cannot be on the committee.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe can choose the president in 8 ways.\n\nWe can choose the committee in $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8\\cdot7}{2} = 28$ ways.\n\nSince the president cannot be on the committee, we need to subtract the number of ways where the president is chosen to be on the committee.\n\nThere are 2 people on the committee, so there are 2 ways to choose the president to be on the committee.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee is $8\\cdot28 - 2 = 222$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$222$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have to first choose a president, and then we have to choose 2 people, but the order in which we choose the people doesn't matter. So first there are 8 ways to choose the president. Then there are 7 ways to choose the first person, and 6 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $7 \\times 6$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $8\\times(7 \\times 6)/2 = \\boxed{168}$ ways to choose a president and a 2-person committee from 8 people."
