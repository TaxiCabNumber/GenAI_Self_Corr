At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest two-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 8?",
        "inference": "The greatest two digit number is 99. But its digits when multiplied will give 9*9=81. We need to reduce the number by one place. So the greatest two digit number with digits multiplied by each other to give 8 is 24.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "$8=1\\cdot8=2\\cdot4$. Therefore, the only two-digit whole numbers the product of whose digits is $8$ are $18$, $81$, $24$, and $42$. The greatest is $\\boxed{81}$."
