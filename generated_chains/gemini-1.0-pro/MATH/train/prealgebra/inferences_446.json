        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circular garden is enlarged so that the new diameter is twice the old diameter. What is the ratio of the original area to the enlarged area? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nThe area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$ so the original area is $\\pi (d/2)^2 = \\pi d^2 / 4$. The enlarged area is $\\pi (2d/2)^2 = \\pi d^2$. So the ratio of the original area to the enlarged area is $\\frac{\\pi d^2 / 4}{\\pi d^2} = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the new diameter is 2 times the original diameter, the new area is $2^2=4$ times the old area.  Therefore, the ratio of original area to new area is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
