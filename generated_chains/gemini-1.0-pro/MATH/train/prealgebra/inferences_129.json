At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different rectangles with sides parallel to the grid can be formed by connecting four of the dots in a $4\\times 4$ square array of dots, as in the figure below?\n[asy]size(2cm,2cm); for (int i=0; i<4; ++i) { for (int j=0; j<4; ++j) { filldraw(Circle((i, j), .05), black, black); } } [/asy] (Two rectangles are different if they do not share all four vertices.)",
        "inference": "The rectangles are determined by choosing any four of the 16 dots in the square; the vertical and horizontal sides of the rectangle are determined by the two chosen rows and the two chosen columns. Because order does not matter for the rows or columns, each rectangle may be determined by choosing a set of four dots from the $4\\times 4$ set. Because there are $\\binom{16}{4} = 1820$ subsets with 4 elements from a set with 16 elements, there are $\\boxed{1820}$ different rectangles.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1820}$. I hope it is correct.",
