At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA recipe for 30 cookies requires two cups of flour among its ingredients. Eduardo wants to bake five dozen cookies. How many cups of flour will he need to use in his adjusted recipe?",
        "inference": "1. First, find the number of cookies in five dozen. One dozen equals 12, so five dozen equals 5 x 12 = 60 cookies. \n2. Next, set up a proportion to find the amount of flour needed: \n     $$30\\ cookies/2\\ cups\\ of\\ flour = 60\\ cookies/x\\ cups\\ of\\ flour$$ \n3. Cross-multiply to solve for x: \n     $$30x = 2 \\times 60$$ \n     $$30x = 120$$ \n     $$x = 120/30$$ \n     $$x = 4$$\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Eduardo wants to make twice as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, he must double the amount of flour required: $(2\\text{ cups})\\times2=\\boxed{4}$ cups."
