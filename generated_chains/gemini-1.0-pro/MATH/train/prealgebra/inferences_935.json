At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular convex polygon with seven sides has exactly one right angle. How many diagonals does this seven-sided polygon have?",
        "inference": "A convex polygon with n sides has $$\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$$ diagonals.\n\nFor a n-sided polygon with one right angle, the number of diagonals is $$\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}-n+3.$$\n\nSo, for a seven-sided polygon with one right angle, the number of diagonals is $$\\frac{7(7-3)}{2}-7+3 = 14.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{14}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For each vertex, we can create a diagonal by connecting it to any non-adjacent vertex. If there are $n$ vertices, there are $n(n-3)$ diagonals we draw. But we are over-counting by a factor of 2 since each diagonal can be created from 2 vertices. So there are $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals. In this problem, since $n=7$, there are $7\\cdot4/2=\\boxed{14}$ diagonals."
