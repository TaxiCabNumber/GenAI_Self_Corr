At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile standing in line to buy concert tickets, Kit moved 60 feet closer to the ticket window over a period of 30 minutes. At this rate, how many minutes will it take her to move the remaining 70 yards to the ticket window?",
        "inference": "First, convert the 60 feet to yards because 70 yards is given.\n$$60 \\text{ ft}\\left(\\frac{1 \\text{ yd}}{3 \\text{ ft}}\\right)=20 \\text{ yd}$$\n\nThen, set up a proportion to compare the distance already traveled to the remaining distance with the time already taken to the time it will take to travel the remaining distance.\n$$\\frac{20}{30}=\\frac{70}{x}$$\n\nCross-multiply to solve for x.\n$$20x=30(70)$$\n$$20x=2100$$\n$$\\frac{20x}{20}=\\frac{2100}{20}$$\n$$x=105$$\n\nTherefore, it will take Kit 105 minutes to move the remaining 70 yards to the ticket window.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$105$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "She moved 60 feet in 30 minutes, meaning her rate is $\\frac{60}{30} = 2$ feet per minute.  She has $70\\cdot 3 = 210$ feet remaining, meaning she will need $\\frac{210}{2} = \\boxed{105}$ more minutes."
