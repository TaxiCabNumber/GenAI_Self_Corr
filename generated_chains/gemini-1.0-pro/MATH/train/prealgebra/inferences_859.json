        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the time it took Stan to drive 300 miles to hours.\n* 5 hours, 20 minutes = 5 hours + 20/60 hours = 5.33 hours\n\n**Step 2:** Convert the time it took Stan to drive 360 miles to hours.\n* 6 hours, 40 minutes = 6 hours + 40/60 hours = 6.67 hours\n\n**Step 3:** Find the total distance Stan drove.\n* 300 miles + 360 miles = 660 miles\n\n**Step 4:** Find the total time it took Stan to drive.\n* 5.33 hours + 6.67 hours = 12 hours\n\n**Step 5:** Find Stan's average speed.\n* Average speed = Total distance / Total time\n* Average speed = 660 miles / 12 hours = 55 mph\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$55$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
