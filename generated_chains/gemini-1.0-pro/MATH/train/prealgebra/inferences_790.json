At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA teacher has a class with $24$ students in it. If she wants to split the students into equal groups of at most $10$ students each, what is the least number of groups that she needs?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nSince at most $10$ students can be in each group, the total number of students must be divisible by $10$. Since $24$ is divisible by $10$, we need $24/10 = \\boxed{2}$ groups.\n**Final Answer: $2$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For the teacher to be able to split her students into $x$ groups of $y$ students each, $y$ must be a divisor of $24$. Since we want to create as few groups as possible, we need to maximize the number of students in each group. Thus, $y$ should be the greatest divisor of $24$ that is less than or equal to $10$. This means that $y=8$ and $x=3$. The teacher can create $\\boxed{3}$ groups of $8$ students each."
