        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand on a standard clock when it indicates $9$:$40$?",
        "inference": "**A clock has 12 (12-hour format) or 24 (24-hour format) divisions.**\n**Each division is further divided into 5 minutes.**\n**So, in both cases, there are 12 * 5 = 60 divisions on a clock.**\n\n**The hour hand takes 12 hours or 720 minutes to complete a full circle.**\n**So, it moves 30 degrees in 60 minutes.**\n\n**The minute hand takes 60 minutes to complete a full circle.**\n**So, it moves 6 degrees in 60 minutes.**\n\n**When it indicates 9:40, the minute hand has moved 40 minutes past the hour.**\n**So, it has moved 40 * 6 = 240 degrees.**\n\n**The hour hand has moved 9 hours and 40 minutes past the hour.**\n**So, it has moved 9 * 30 + 40/60 * 30 = 270 + 20 = 290 degrees.**\n\n**The acute angle formed by the hour hand and minute hand is the difference between their angles of rotation.**\n**So, the angle is 290 - 240 = 50 degrees.**\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is $40/60=2/3$ of the way from the 9 to the 10 on the clock, which the minute hand is on the 8. Between any two numbers on the clock there are $360/12=30$ degrees. Thus, the angle between the two hands is $30+30(2/3)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
