At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has an area of 400 $\\text{cm}^2$. If the rectangle is a square, what is its perimeter?",
        "inference": "Area of a square = 400 $\\text{cm}^2$.\n\nSince the area of a square is equal to the square of its side length, we have:\n\nSide length = $\\sqrt{400}$ cm = 20 cm.\n\nPerimeter of a square = 4 * Side length = 4 * 20 cm = 80 cm.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{80}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $s$ is the side of the square, then $s^2=400$.  Therefore, $s=20$.  The perimeter is $4(20)=\\boxed{80}$ cm."
