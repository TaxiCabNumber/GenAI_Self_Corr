At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a square plot of land is 325 square meters. What is the perimeter of the square, in meters? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",

So, for a square with an area of 325 square meters, we have:\n\n$$325 = s^2$$\n\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{325} = 5\\sqrt{13}$$\n\nThe perimeter of a square is given by $P = 4s$, so the perimeter of this square is:\n\n$$P = 4(5\\sqrt{13}) = 20\\sqrt{13}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{13}.}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $s$ is the side of the square, $s^2 = 325$, so $s = \\sqrt{325} = \\sqrt{65 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{13 \\cdot 25} = 5\\sqrt{13}$. The perimeter is $4s$, or $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{13}}$."
