At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt lunch, $60\\%$ of the students selected soda while $20\\%$ selected milk. If 72 students selected soda, how many students selected milk?",
        "inference": "Let x be the total number of students.\nThen, $60\\%$ of x selected soda, which is $0.6x = 72$\nSo, $x = 72/0.6 = 120$\n$20\\%$ of x selected milk, which is $0.2x = 0.2(120) = 24$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of students who selected milk will be $\\frac{20\\%}{60\\%}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the number of students who selected soda.  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 72=\\boxed{24}$ students selected milk."
