At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 11:00 a.m. how many degrees are in the smaller angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand of the clock?",
        "inference": "At 11:00 a.m, the hour hand is between 11 and 12, and the minute hand is at 12.\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves 360/12 = 30 degrees per hour.\n\nFrom 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the hour hand moves 30 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 360/60 = 6 degrees per minute.\n\nFrom 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the minute hand moves 6 * 60 = 360 degrees.\n\nThe smaller angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand is 360 - 30 = 330 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{330}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The minute hand is pointing directly at the 12 and the hour hand is pointing directly at the 11.  Therefore, the angle they form is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{1}{12}\\times 360^\\circ=\\boxed{30}$ degrees."
