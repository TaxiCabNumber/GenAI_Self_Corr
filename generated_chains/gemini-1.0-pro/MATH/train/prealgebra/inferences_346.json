        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$500$ in maintenance fees each day and then it pays each worker $\\$15$ per hour. Each worker makes 5 widgets per hour, which are sold at $\\$3.10$ each. What is the least number of workers the company has to hire in order to make a profit in an 8-hour workday?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nIncome per worker per day: 5 widgets * $3.10/widget = $15.50\n\nTotal cost per worker per day: $15/hour * 8 hours/day + $500 = $620\n\nProfit per worker per day: $15.50 - $620 = -$604.50\n\nTo make a profit, the company needs to hire at least 1 worker such that the income is greater than or equal to the cost.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of workers $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue in a day of work. The cost of each worker is $\\$15$ per hour, while the revenue that comes from each worker hired is $\\$3.10\\times5$ widgets per hour. \\begin{align*}\n500+8(15n)&<(8)(3.1)(5)n=124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500+120n&<124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500&<4n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n125&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than 125 is 126, so the company has to hire at least $\\boxed{126}$ workers to make a profit."
