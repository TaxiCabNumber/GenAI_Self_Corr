        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Stewart's math class has 16 boys, and 22 of his students bring their calculators to class.  If 13 of the students who brought calculators are girls, then how many boys didn't bring their calculators to class?",
        "inference": "1. Since there are 16 boys in the class, and 13 girls brought calculators, that means 22 - 13 = 9 boys brought calculators.\n\n2. To find the number of boys who didn't bring calculators, we need to subtract those who brought calculators from the total number of boys. So, 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this using basic arithmetic: If 13 of the students with calculators are girls, and 22 students total have calculators, then $22 - 13 = 9$ of the students with calculators are boys.  So if 9 boys have calculators, and there are 16 boys total, then $16 - 9 = \\boxed{7}$ boys don't have calculators.  Alternatively, we could solve this problem using a Venn diagram."
