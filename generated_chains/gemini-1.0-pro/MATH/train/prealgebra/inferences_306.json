        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo bake $12$ cookies, I use $2$ quarts of milk. There are $2$ pints in a quart. How many pints of milk do I need to bake $3$ cookies?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of pints in $2$ quarts of milk. There are $2$ pints in $1$ quart. So, in $2$ quarts, there are $2\\times2=4$ pints of milk.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of pints of milk needed to bake $1$ cookie. Since $2$ quarts of milk are used to bake $12$ cookies, the number of pints of milk needed to bake $1$ cookie is $4/12=1/3$ pints of milk.\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the number of pints of milk needed to bake $3$ cookies. The number of pints of milk needed to bake $3$ cookies is $1/3\\times3=1$ pint of milk.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, convert quarts to pints. $1$ quart is $2$ pints, so $2$ quarts is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ pints. So, it takes $4$ pints of milk to bake $12$ cookies. Because the proportion of milk to cookies is constant, divide both the pints of milk and the number of cookies by $4$ to obtain that $\\boxed{1}$ pint of milk is needed to bake $3$ cookies."
