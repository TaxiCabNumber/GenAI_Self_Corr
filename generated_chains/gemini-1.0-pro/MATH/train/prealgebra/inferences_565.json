At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe tail of a 1-mile long train exits a tunnel exactly 3 minutes after the front of the train entered the tunnel.  If the train is moving 60 miles per hour, how many miles long is the tunnel?",
        "inference": "Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour = 60 * 5280 / 60 * 60 = 146.6667 feet/sec\n\nTrain's length = 1 mile = 5280 feet\n\nTime between entry and exit of the tail of a train = 3 minutes = 3 * 60 = 180 sec\n\nDistance traveled during this period = Speed x Time\n\nDistance traveled by the entire train = Distance traveled during the 180 sec + Train's length\n\nDistance traveled during the 180 sec = 146.6667 feet/sec * 180 sec\n\n= 26400 feet\n\nDistance traveled by the entire train during the period = 26400 feet + 5280 feet\n\n= 31680 feet\n\n= 31680 feet / 5280 feet / mile\n\n= 6 miles\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the train is moving 60 miles per hour, the front of the train moves 1 mile every minute. Therefore, in the three minutes since the front of the train entered the tunnel, the front of the train has moved three miles. At the end of these three minutes, we know the front of the train is 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel,because the train is one mile long and its tail is just leaving the tunnel.  So, the front of the train has moved 3 miles from the beginning of the tunnel and is now 1 mile beyond the end of the tunnel. This tells us that the tunnel is $3-1 = \\boxed{2\\text{ miles}}$ long."
