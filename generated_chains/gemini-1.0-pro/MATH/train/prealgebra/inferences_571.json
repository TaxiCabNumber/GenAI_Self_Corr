In a rhombus with adjacent sides forming a $60$-degree angle, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.\n3. Let's draw the rhombus and label the diagonals as $d_1$ and $d_2$. Since each side measures $2$ cm, the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of $2$ cm and an angle of $30$ degrees.\n4.
