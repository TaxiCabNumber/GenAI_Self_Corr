        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA boy has the following seven coins in his pocket: $2$ pennies, $2$ nickels, $2$ dimes, and $1$ quarter. He takes out two coins, records the sum of their values, and then puts them back with the other coins. He continues to take out two coins, record the sum of their values, and put them back. How many different sums can he record at most?",
        "inference": "Since there are $7$ coins, the boy can take out two coins in $7 \\times 6 = 42$ different ways. There are $4$ different types of coins, so the sum of the values of the two coins can be:\n\n* $1$ penny and $1$ nickel ($6$ cents)\n* $1$ penny and $1$ dime ($11$ cents)\n* $1$ penny and $1$ quarter ($26$ cents)\n* $1$ nickel and $1$ dime ($16$ cents)\n* $1$ nickel and $1$ quarter ($31$ cents)\n* $1$ dime and $1$ quarter ($36$ cents)\n\nTherefore, there are $6$ different sums that the boy can record.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The following pairs of numbers represent the values of the two coins the boy could take from his pocket: $$\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n(1,1) & (1,5) & (1,10) & (1,25) \\\\\n(5,5) & (5,10) & (5,25) & \\\\\n(10,10) & (10,25) & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$Each of the above pairs has a sum that is different from the sum of each of the other pairs. Therefore there are $\\boxed{9}$ different sums."
