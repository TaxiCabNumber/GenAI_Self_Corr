At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAbe, Bobby, Charles, Devin and Edwin are the participants in a race. How many different 1st-2nd-3rd place outcomes are possible if there are no ties? Two different outcomes to include are Bobby-Devin-Edwin and Devin-Bobby-Edwin.",

For the second place, there are 4 possibilities (since the first place winner cannot be in second place).\n3. For the third place, there are 3 possibilities (since the first and second place winners cannot be in third place).\n4. Therefore, the total number of different 1st-2nd-3rd place outcomes is 5 x 4 x 3 = **60**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
