At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLuna writes down all the five-digit numbers that contain each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once.  What is the smallest number in Luna's list that is divisible by 6?",
        "inference": "1. The number must be divisible by 2, since it is even. This means that the last digit must be 2 or 4.\n2. The number must be divisible by 3, since it is divisible by 6. This means that the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3.\n3. The sum of the digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. This is divisible by 3, so the number is divisible by 3.\n4. The smallest five-digit number that is divisible by 2, 3, and contains each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 exactly once is 12345.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12345$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nA number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is even.  A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  The sum of the digits in each of Luna's numbers is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$, which is divisible by 3, so each of Luna's numbers is divisible by 3.\n\nThe smallest number in Luna's list is 12345, which is not divisible by 2.  The next smallest number in Luna's list is 12354, which is divisible by 2, so the answer is $\\boxed{12354}$."
