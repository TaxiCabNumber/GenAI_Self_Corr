At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Anything smaller, you can check if it's even, or ends in a $5$, or the digits sum to $3$, or maybe it's the same digit repeated twice, such as $77$. Remember that $91$ is not prime!\n\n$87$ factors as $3\\cdot29$, $89$ is prime, $91$ factors into $7\\cdot13$, and $93$ as $3\\cdot31$. All together, that is $3^2\\cdot7\\cdot13\\cdot29\\cdot31\\cdot89$, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ different prime factors."
