At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe arithmetic mean of nine numbers is 54. If two numbers $u$ and $v$ are added to the list, the mean of the eleven-member list becomes 66. What is the mean of $u$ and $v$?",
        "inference": "Let the sum of the original nine numbers be $9x$. Then, their mean is $\\frac{9x}{9}=x$.\n\nAfter adding $u$ and $v$, the sum of the eleven numbers becomes $9x+u+v$. The mean of the eleven numbers is $\\frac{9x+u+v}{11}$.\n\nWe are given that the mean of the eleven numbers is 66, so we have:\n\n$$\\frac{9x+u+v}{11}=66$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 11, we have:\n\n$$9x+u+v=726$$\n\nSubstituting $x=54$, we have:\n\n$$9(54)+u+v=726$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$$522+u+v=726$$\n\nSubtracting 522 from both sides, we have:\n\n$$u+v=726-522$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$$u+v=204$$\n\nTherefore, the mean of $u$ and $v$ is $\\frac{u+v}{2}=\\frac{204}{2}=\\boxed{102}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{102}$.

        "ground_truth": "The original nine numbers, with mean 54, must have a sum of $9 \\cdot 54 = 486$. After including $u$ and $v$, we have eleven numbers now, and their sum must be $11 \\cdot 66 = 726$. Since the only new numbers in this sum are $u$ and $v$, $u+ v = 726 - 486 = 240$.
