        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Chemistry class, Samantha finds that she can make a certain solution by mixing $.04$ liters of chemical A with $.02$ liters of water (this gives her $.06$ liters of the solution). She wants to make a total of $.48$ liters of this new solution.  To do so, how many liters of water will she use?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of liters of chemical A and $y$ be the number of liters of water. \n\nWe know that the total amount of solution is $0.48$ liters and the ratio of chemical A to water is $0.04$ liters of chemical A to $0.02$ liters of water. \n\nSo, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n$$x+y=0.48$$\n\n$$\\frac{x}{0.04}=\\frac{y}{0.02}$$\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get:\n\n$$25x=50y$$\n\n$$x=2y$$\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$2y+y=0.48$$\n\n$$3y=0.48$$\n\n$$y=0.16$$\n\nTherefore, the number of liters of water she will use is $\\boxed{0.16}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that $\\frac{.02}{.06}=\\frac{1}{3}$ is the fraction of water in the solution.  Thus, since Samantha wants $.48$ total liters of the solution, we have that she must use $.48 \\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{0.16}$ liters of water."
