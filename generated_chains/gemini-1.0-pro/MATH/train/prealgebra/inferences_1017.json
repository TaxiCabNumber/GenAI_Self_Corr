At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe hypotenuse of a right triangle measures $6\\sqrt{2}$ inches and one angle is $45^{\\circ}$. What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Since one angle of the right triangle is $45^{\\circ}$, we know that the other two angles must be $45^{\\circ}$ as well, so it is an isosceles right triangle.  \n\nIn an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are congruent, so the length of each leg is $6\\sqrt{2}\\div\\sqrt{2}$ = $6$ inches.  \n\nThe area of a triangle is $A = {1\\over 2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.  \n\nIn this case, the base and height are both $6$ inches, so the area is $A = {1\\over 2}(6)(6) = \\boxed{18}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\\circ$, then the other is $90^\\circ-45^\\circ =45^\\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle.  The hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has 6.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(6)(6)/2 = \\boxed{18}$."
