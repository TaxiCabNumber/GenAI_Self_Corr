        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bus can hold a maximum of 38 students. What is the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the number of complete buses needed: 411 \u00f7 38 = 10.8158\n2. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, round up to the next whole number: 10.8158 rounded up to 11.\n3. Therefore, the minimum number of buses needed is 11.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $n$ buses will carry $38n$ students, we need $38n>411$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $38$, we have $n>\\dfrac{411}{38}$. We can convert $\\dfrac{411}{38}$ to a mixed number: $$\\frac{411}{38} = \\frac{380}{38}+\\frac{31}{38} = 10\\frac{31}{38}.$$ Since the number of buses must be an integer, the smallest possible number of buses is $\\boxed{11}$."
