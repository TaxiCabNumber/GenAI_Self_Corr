At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI am playing a walking game with myself.  On move 1, I do nothing, but on move $n$ where $2 \\le n \\le 25$, I take one step forward if $n$ is prime and two steps backwards if the number is composite.  After all 25 moves, I stop and walk back to my original starting point.  How many steps long is my walk back?",

The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, so there are 9 prime numbers.
