At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA piece of string fits exactly once around the perimeter of a square whose area is 144.  Rounded to the nearest whole number, what is the area of the largest circle that can be formed from the piece of string?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of the square is equal to the circumference of the circle.\n\nLet \\(s\\) be the side length of the square. Then, \\(s^2=144 \\) and \\(s=12\\).\n\nThe perimeter of the square is \\(4s=48\\)\n\nThe circumference of the circle is \\(2 \\pi r \\). Thus,\n\n$$ 48 = 2\\pi r $$\n\n$$ r = \\frac{48}{2\\pi} \\approx 7.64 $$\n\nThe area of the circle is \\( \\pi r^2 \\). Thus,\n\n$$ \\text{Area} = (7.64)^2 \\approx 58.6 $$\n\nFinal Answer:  \\\\boxed{$58.6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of the square is 144, each side has length $\\sqrt{144}=12$.  The length of the string equals the perimeter of the square which is $4 \\times 12=48$.  The largest circle that can be formed from this string has a circumference of 48 or $2\\pi r=48$.  Solving for the radius $r$, we get $r=\\frac{48}{2\\pi} = \\frac{24}{\\pi}$. Therefore, the maximum area of a circle that can be formed using the string is $\\pi \\cdot \\left( \\frac{24}{\\pi} \\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{\\pi} \\approx \\boxed{183}$."
