At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-digit positive integers exist that satisfy the following conditions: (A) Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5, and (B) the last two digits cannot be the same digit, and (C) each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8?",

So, there are $3\\cdot3\\cdot3=27$ possible combinations for the first three digits.\n\n**Step 2:** For the last digit, there are three choices. Since the last two digits cannot be the same, there are $3\\cdot2=6$ possible combinations for the last two digits.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of combinations for the first three digits by the number of combinations for the last two digits to get the total number of possible 4-digit integers: $27\\cdot6=162$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{162}$. I hope it is correct.**",
