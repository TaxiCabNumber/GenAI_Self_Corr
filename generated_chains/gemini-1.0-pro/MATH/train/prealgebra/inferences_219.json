        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKenton watched 2000 adult men and women board a cruise ship. Half of the adults were women. If 20$\\%$ of the women and 9$\\%$ of the men were wearing sunglasses, what was the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the number of women on the ship.**\n\nSince half of the adults are women, there are 2000/2 = 1000 women on the ship.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of women wearing sunglasses.**\n\n20% of the 1000 women are wearing sunglasses, so 1000 * 0.20 = 200 women are wearing sunglasses.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of men on the ship.**\n\nSince there are 1000 women on the ship, there are 2000 - 1000 = 1000 men on the ship.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of men wearing sunglasses.**\n\n9% of the 1000 men are wearing sunglasses, so 1000 * 0.09 = 90 men are wearing sunglasses.\n\n**Step 5: Find the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses.**\n\nThe total number of men and women wearing sunglasses is 200 + 90 = 290.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$290$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men.  Thus, $20\\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses."
