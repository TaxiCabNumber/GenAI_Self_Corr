At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary wants to buy one large pizza, one medium pizza, and three drinks. The drinks cost $p$ dollars each, the medium pizza costs two times as much as one drink, and the large pizza costs three times as much as one drink. If Mary started with $30$ dollars, how much money would she have left after making all of her purchases?  Give your answer as an expression of $p$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The cost of the drinks is $3p$ dollars.\n\n**Step 2:** The cost of the medium pizza is $2p$ dollars.\n\n**Step 3:** The cost of the large pizza is $3p$ dollars.\n\n**Step 4:** The total cost of all of Mary's purchases is $3p + 2p + 3p = 8p$ dollars.\n\n**Step 5:** Mary will have $30 - 8p$ dollars left after making all of her purchases.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$30 - 8p$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let's first look at how much total money Mary spent. Since drinks cost $p$ dollars, and she bought $3$ of them, she spent $3p$ dollars on drinks. One drink costs $p$ dollars, so a medium pizza costs $2p$ dollars and a large pizza costs $3p$ dollars. Therefore, in total, Mary spent \\[3p+2p+3p=8p\\] dollars.\n\nNow, Mary had $30$ dollars to begin with, and she spent $8p$ dollars, so she has \\[\\boxed{30-8p}\\] dollars left."
