At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nUsing the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how many even three-digit numbers less than 500 can be formed if each digit can be used more than once?",
        "inference": "1. Select the digit for the hundreds place: There are 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 4) since 5 cannot be used in the hundreds place.\n2. Select the digit for the tens place: There are 5 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) since all digits can be used.\n3. Select the digit for the units place: There are 5 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) since all digits can be used.\n4. However, we need to exclude the case where the number is greater than or equal to 500. This can happen only when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 5. There is only 1 such case: 455.\n5. Therefore, the total number of even three-digit numbers less than 500 that can be formed is $4 \\times 5 \\times 5 - 1 = 95$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{95}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four choices for the hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. The tens digit is unrestricted; it could be any one of the five. Finally, the units digit can only be a 2 or 4. Thus, there are $4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{40}$ such numbers that can be formed."
