At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle with the measure of angle $A$ equal to 90 degrees. The length of segment $AC$ is 6 cm. What is the area of triangle $ABC$, in square centimeters?",
        "inference": "Since it's a right triangle, we know that $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$. Since it's isosceles, we know that $AB = BC$. Let's call that length $x$.\n\nSo, we have $x^2 + x^2 = 6^2$.\n$2x^2 = 36$.\n$x^2 = 18$.\n$x = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{18}$ square centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the triangle is isosceles, the length of $AB$ is also 6cm. The area of the triangle is then $(AB\\cdot AC)/2=(6\\cdot6)/2=\\boxed{18}$ square centimeters."
