        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConvex hexagon $ABCDEF$ has exactly two distinct side lengths. Side $AB$ measures 5 units, and side $BC$ measures 6 units. The perimeter of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 34 units. How many sides of hexagon $ABCDEF$ have measure 6 units?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** We know that the perimeter of the hexagon is 34 units, so the sum of the side lengths is 34.\n\n**Step 2:** We know that two sides have length 5 and 6, respectively. So the sum of the remaining four sides is 34 - 5 - 6 = 23.\n\n**Step 3:** We can divide the remaining perimeter into four equal parts to get the length of each of the remaining sides. 23/4 = 5.75.\n\n**Step 4:** Since the side lengths are integers, the remaining sides must be either 5 or 6 units.\n\n**Step 5:** Since two sides are already 6 units, there must be only two remaining sides that are 6 units.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If all sides measured $6$ units, the total perimeter would be $36$.  But this is $2$ too many units, so we must change two of these sides to $5$ units.  Thus $\\boxed{4}$ sides measure $6$ units."
