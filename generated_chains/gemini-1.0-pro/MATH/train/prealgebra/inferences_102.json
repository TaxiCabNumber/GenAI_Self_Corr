        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?",
        "inference": "The square root of $x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4.\nThis means that $3 < \\sqrt{x} < 4$.\nSquaring all the terms, we get\n$9 < x < 16$.\nThus, the possible integer values of $x$ are $10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15$.\nThere are $6$ integer values of $x$ that satisfy the given condition.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because $4 > \\sqrt{x} > 3$, we know that $16 > x > 9$.  Thus, the integers from 10 to 15 inclusive satisfy this inequality, which means $\\boxed{6}$ integers satisfy the condition in the problem."
