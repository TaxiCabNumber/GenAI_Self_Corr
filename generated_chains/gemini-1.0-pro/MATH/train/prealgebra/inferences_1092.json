At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 12 members, each of whom can play any position.  In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a center, a power forward, a shooting forward, a point guard, and a shooting guard?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** First, we need to choose one player for the center position. There are 12 players to choose from, so we have 12 options for this position.\n\n**Step 2:** Next, we need to choose one player for the power forward position. Since one player has already been chosen for the center position, we now have 11 players to choose from. So, we have 11 options for this position.\n\n**Step 3:** Similarly, we need to choose one player for the shooting forward position, one player for the point guard, and one player for the shooting guard. For each of these positions, we have 10, 9, and 8 options respectively, as one player has already been chosen for each previous position.\n\n**Step 4:** Now, we multiply the number of options for each position to find the total number of ways to choose the starting lineup. So, the total number of ways is:\n\n```\n12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 = 95,040\n```\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$95,040$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 choices for the first position, then 11 players to choose from for the second, then 10 for the third, then 9 for the fourth, and finally just 8 for the fifth, for a total of $ 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = \\boxed{95,\\!040}$."
