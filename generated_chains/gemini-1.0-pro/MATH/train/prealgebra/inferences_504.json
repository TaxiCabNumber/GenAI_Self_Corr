At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many different negative values of $x$ is $\\sqrt{x +150}$ a positive integer?",
        "inference": "Because $\\sqrt{x+150}$ is a positive integer, $x+150$ is a perfect square. The only perfect squares that are less than 150 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, and 121.\n\nSince $x$ is negative, we need to subtract 150 from each of these perfect squares to get the corresponding negative values of $x$. The negative values of $x$ are:\n\n$$-149, -146, -141, -134, -125, -114, -101, -86, -69, -50, \\text{ and } -29.$$\n\nSo there are $\\boxed{11}$ different negative values of $x$ for which $\\sqrt{x+150}$ is a positive integer.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $\\sqrt{x + 150} = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.  Then $x + 150 = n^2$, so $x = n^2 - 150$.  We see that $x$ is negative for $n = 1$, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 12, but positive for $n \\ge 13$, so the number of possible values of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
