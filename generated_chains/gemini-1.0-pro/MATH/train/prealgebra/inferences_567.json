At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes Alice $25$ minutes to clean her room.

        "ground_truth": "Remembering that ``of\" means multiply, we want to find $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25$. Since multiplication is commutative, we have: \\[\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25 = \\frac{25}{5} \\times 2\\]A fraction is another way to represent division, so $\\frac{25}{5} = 25\\div5 = 5$, and $5\\times2 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes."
