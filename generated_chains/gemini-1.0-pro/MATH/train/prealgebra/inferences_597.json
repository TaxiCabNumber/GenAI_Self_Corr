At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBill buys a stock that decreases by $20\\%$ on the first day, and then  on the second day the stock increases by $30\\%$ of its value at the end of the first day. What was the overall percent increase in Bill's stock over the two days?",
        "inference": "The stock decreases by $20\\%$ on the first day, so its value at the end of the first day is $80\\%$ of its original value.\n\nOn the second day, the stock increases by $30\\%$ of its value at the end of the first day, so its value at the end of the second day is $130\\%$ of its value at the end of the first day.\n\nTherefore, the overall percent increase in Bill's stock over the two days is $130\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{30\\%}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30\\%}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original value of the stock be $x$. At the end of the first day, the stock has fallen to $.8x$. On the second day, the stock rises to $1.3(.8x)=1.04x$. Thus, the stock has increased $\\boxed{4}$ percent from its original price over the two days."
