        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree measure of the supplement of the complement of a 42-degree angle?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let the given angle be x = 42 degrees.\n\n**Step 2**: The complement of x, denoted by C, is 90 degrees - x. Therefore, C = 90 - 42 = 48 degrees.\n\n**Step 3**: The supplement of C, denoted by S, is 180 degrees - C. Therefore, S = 180 - 48 = 132 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{132}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "By definition, the complement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $90^\\circ - \\alpha$, and the supplement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nThus, the complement of a 42-degree angle is $90 - 42 = 48$ degrees, and the supplement of a 48-degree angle is $180 - 48 = \\boxed{132}$ degrees."
