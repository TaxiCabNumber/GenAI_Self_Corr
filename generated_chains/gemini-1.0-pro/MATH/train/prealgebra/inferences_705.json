In 44 minutes, it would have moved 44 * 6 = 264 degrees.\n\nTo find the acute angle between the hands, we need to find the smaller of the two angles formed by the hands. The larger angle is 360 - 202 = 158 degrees. The smaller angle is 202 - 158 = 44 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$44$}. I hope it is correct.",
