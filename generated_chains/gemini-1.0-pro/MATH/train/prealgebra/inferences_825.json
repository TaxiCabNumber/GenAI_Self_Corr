At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam has $15$ of a certain type of rare coin and is interested in knowing how much this collection is worth.  He discovers that $5$ of these coins are worth $12$ dollars in total. Assuming that the value of each coin is the same, how many dollars is his entire collection worth?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nIf $5$ coins are worth $12$ dollars, then $1$ coin is worth $12/5$ dollars.  Therefore, $15$ coins are worth $12/5 \\cdot 15 = 36$ dollars.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$36$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $15=5 \\times 3$, the total value of his collection will be worth $3$ times the amount that the $5$ coins are worth by themselves.  Thus the total value of his coin collection is $12 \\times 3=\\boxed{36}$ dollars."
