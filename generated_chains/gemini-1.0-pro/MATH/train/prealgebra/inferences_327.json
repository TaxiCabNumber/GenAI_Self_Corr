At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJimmy notices $7$ oranges weigh the same as $5$ apples.  If Jimmy has $28$ oranges, how many apples would Jimmy need to equal the weight of his $28$ oranges?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the weight of 1 orange.\nThe weight of 7 oranges = The weight of 5 apples\nWeight of 1 orange = Weight of 7 oranges / 7\nWeight of 1 orange = 5/7 * Weight of 1 apple\n\n**Step 2:** Find the weight of 28 oranges.\nWeight of 28 oranges = Weight of 1 orange * 28\nWeight of 28 oranges = 5/7 * Weight of 1 apple * 28\nWeight of 28 oranges = 200/7 * Weight of 1 apple\n\n**Step 3:** Find the number of apples needed to equal the weight of 28 oranges.\nNumber of apples = Weight of 28 oranges / Weight of 1 apple\nNumber of apples = 200/7 * Weight of 1 apple / Weight of 1 apple\nNumber of apples = 200/7\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{28.57}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the weight of $7$ oranges is equal to the weight of $5$ apples, Jimmy needs only $5$ apples for every $7$ oranges in order for their weight to be equal.  So Jimmy needs $\\frac{5}{7} \\times 28=\\boxed{20}$ apples.\n\nNote: Read the problem carefully! It does not say that the ratio of the number of oranges to apples is 7:5. It says the ratio of the weight of oranges to apples is 7:5. This is a huge difference!"
