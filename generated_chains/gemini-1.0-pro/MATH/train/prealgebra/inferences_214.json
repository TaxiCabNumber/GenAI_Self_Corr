At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a set of five consecutive integers, the largest integer is less than twice the average of the five integers. What is the smallest integer that could be in the set?",

The average of the five integers is $$\\frac{x+(x+1)+(x+2)+(x+3)+(x+4)}{5}=\\frac{5x+10}{5}=x+2$$.\n\nSo, $$x+4<2(x+2)$$.  Simplifying,\n\n$$x+4<2x+4$$\n\n$$4<x+4$$\n\n$$0<x$$\n\nSo, the smallest integer that could be in the set is $$\\boxed{1}$$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$ and $n+4$.  Their average is $n+2$, so we have $$n+4<2(n+2) \\Rightarrow n+4<2n+4 \\Rightarrow 0<n.$$Thus $n$ is at least $\\boxed{1}$."
