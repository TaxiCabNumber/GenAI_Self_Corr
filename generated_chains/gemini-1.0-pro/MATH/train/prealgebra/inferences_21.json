At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of white balls and red balls in a jar is in the ratio of $3:2$. If there are 9 white balls, how many red balls are there?",
        "inference": "Let the number of red balls be $x$.\n\nThen, the ratio of white balls to red balls is $3:2$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{9}{x} = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get $2 \\times 9 = 3 \\times x$\n\nSimplifying, we get $18 = 3x$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get $x = 6$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$6$}.

        "ground_truth": "For every 3 white balls in the jar, there are 2 red balls in the jar. Since there are 9 white balls in the jar, which is 3 groups of 3 white balls, there must be 3 groups of 2 red balls in the jar. Thus, there are $3\\times2 =\\boxed{6}$ red balls in the jar."
