At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 20 people in my club.  8 of them are left-handed.  15 of them like jazz music.  2 of them are right-handed and dislike jazz music.  How many club members are left-handed and like jazz music? Assume people are either left-handed or right-handed, but not both.",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) represent the number of people who are left-handed and like jazz music.\n\nSince 8 of the 20 people in the club are left-handed, \\(x+2\\) are right-handed.\n\nSince 15 of the 20 people in the club like jazz music, \\(x+13\\) dislike jazz music.\n\nSince 2 of the 20 people in the club are right-handed and dislike jazz music, \\(x+2\\) must equal 2.\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n$$x+2=2$$\n\n$$x=2-2$$\n\n$$x=0$$\n\nTherefore, 0 members of the club are left-handed and like jazz music.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of lefty jazz lovers be $x$.  So $8-x$ lefties dislike jazz and $15-x$ jazz lovers are righties.  Since the number of righty jazz dislikers is 2 and the total number of members of the club is 20, we can add these four exclusive categories to get $x + (8 - x) + (15 - x) + 2 = 20$, so $x = \\boxed{5}$, which is the number of lefty jazz lovers."
