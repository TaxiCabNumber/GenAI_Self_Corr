At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "There are 10 two-digit numbers with a 7 as their 10's digit, and 9 two-digit numbers with 7 as their units digit. Because 77 satisfies both of these properties, the answer is $10+9-1 = \\boxed{18}$."
