At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAuston is 60 inches tall. Using the conversion 1 inch = 2.54 cm, how tall is Auston in centimeters? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert Auston's height from inches to centimeters.\n```\n60 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 152.4 cm\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Round the result to the nearest tenth.\n```\n152.4 cm rounded to the nearest tenth is 152.4 cm.\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$152.4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "When working with unit conversion, it's easiest to think of the units as variables themselves.\n\nIn this problem, the unit we begin with is inches, and we want to end up with centimeters. Nonetheless, we don't want to change the quantity, only the units -- we must look for a ratio of units which is equal to one.\n\nSince $1 \\mbox{ inch} = 2.54 \\mbox{ cm}$, we can divide by sides by 1 inch to find  $$\\frac{2.54\\mbox{ cm}}{1\\mbox{ in}} = 1.$$\n\nSo, Auston is $$60\\mbox{ in} \\cdot \\frac{2.54 \\mbox{ cm}}{1 \\mbox{ in}} = \\boxed{152.4}\\mbox{ cm}$$ tall."
