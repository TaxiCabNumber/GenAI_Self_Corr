        "inference": "Prime factorization of 6 is \\(2\\times3\\). Thus, \\(2345N\\) is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and by 3. It is divisible by 2 if \\(N\\) is even.

        "ground_truth": "The number $2345N$ is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nThe number $2345N$ is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit $N$ is even, so $N$ must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nThe number $2345N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, which is $2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + N = N + 14$.  We see that $N + 14$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $N$ is one of the digits 1, 4, or 7.\n\nTherefore, there is in fact only one digit $N$ for which $2345N$ is divisible by 6, namely $N = \\boxed{4}$."
