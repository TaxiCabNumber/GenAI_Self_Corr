At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree-fourths of the parrots on Bird Island are green, and the remainder are blue. If there are 92 parrots total on Bird Island, how many of those parrots are blue?",
        "inference": "Let's start by finding out how many parrots are green. Since three-fourths of the parrots are green, we can multiply 92 by 3/4 to find the number of green parrots:\n\n3/4 \u00d7 92 = 69\n\nSo, there are 69 green parrots on Bird Island.\n\nNow, to find the number of blue parrots, we can simply subtract the number of green parrots from the total number of parrots:\n\n92 - 69 = 23\n\nTherefore, there are 23 blue parrots on Bird Island.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{23}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\dfrac{3}{4}$ of the parrots are green and the rest are blue, then $1-\\dfrac{3}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the parrots are blue. Since there are 92 parrots total, there must be $\\dfrac{1}{4}(92) = \\boxed{23}$ blue parrots."
