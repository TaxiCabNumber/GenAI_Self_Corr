At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Ponde family's Powerjet pumps 420 gallons of water per hour. At this rate, how many gallons of water will it pump in 45 minutes?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 45 minutes to hours: 45 minutes = 3/4 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)\n\n2. Multiply the pumping rate (gallons per hour) by the number of hours: 420 gallons per hour * 3/4 hours = 420 * 3/4 gallons\n\n3. Simplify the multiplication: 420 * 3/4 = 1050/4 = 262.5 gallons\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{262.5}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 45 minutes is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an hour, the Powerjet will pump $420\\times\\frac{3}{4}=\\boxed{315}$ gallons of water in 45 minutes."
