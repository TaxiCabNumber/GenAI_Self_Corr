There are 25 such multiples.\n\nThe multiples of 3, 5, and 4 between 1 and 200 are 60, 120, 180. There are 3 such multiples.\n\nThe multiples of 3, 5, and 7 between 1 and 200 are 105 and 140.

The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers."
