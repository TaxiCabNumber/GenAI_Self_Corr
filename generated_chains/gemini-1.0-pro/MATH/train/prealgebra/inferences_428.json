At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many two-digit prime numbers have a units digit of 7?",

        "ground_truth": "The tens digit cannot be 2, 5, or 8 because otherwise, the sum of the digits, and thus the number itself, is divisible by 3.
