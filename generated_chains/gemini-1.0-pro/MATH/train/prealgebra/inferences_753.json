At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rhombus has an area of 108 square units. The lengths of its diagonals have a ratio of 3 to 2. What is the length of the longest diagonal, in units?",
        "inference": "Let x and y be the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus, where y>x.\n\nArea of Rhombus = 1/2 * x * y\n\n108 = (1/2) * x * y\n\nx * y = 216\n\nx : y = 3 : 2\n\nx = (3/2) * y\n\nSubstituting in the equation:\n\n(3/2) * y * y = 216\n\ny^2 = 144\n\ny = 12\n\nx = (3/2) * 12 = 18\n\nLength of longest diagonal = 18 units\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the diagonals have length $3x$ and $2x$. Half the product of the diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the area, so $(2x)(3x)/2= 108$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 6$. Therefore, the length of the longest diagonal is $3x = \\boxed{18}$."
