At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in units, of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths of 75 and 100 units?",
        "inference": "1. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.\n\n2. In this case, the legs of the triangle have lengths of 75 and 100 units. So, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is:\n\n$$h^2 = 75^2 + 100^2 = 5625 + 10000 = 15625$$\n\n3. To find the length of the hypotenuse, we take the square root of both sides of the equation:\n\n$$h = \\sqrt{15625} = 125$$\n\n4. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 125 units.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{125}$. I hope it is correct.",
