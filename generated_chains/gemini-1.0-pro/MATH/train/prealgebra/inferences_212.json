        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex bakes a total of $24$ pies, and each pie is apple, blueberry, or cherry. The ratio of apple to blueberry to cherry pies is $1:4:3$. How many cherry pies did Alex bake?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of parts.**\n$1+4+3=8$\n\n**Step 2: Find the value of each part.**\n$24 \\div 8 = 3$\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the value of each part by the corresponding ratio.**\nCherry pies: $3 \\times 3 = \\boxed{9}$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The $24$ pies are divided into $1+4+3 = 8$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{24}{8} = 3$ pies per part. Since three parts of the pies are cherry, Alex baked $3 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{9}$ cherry pies."
