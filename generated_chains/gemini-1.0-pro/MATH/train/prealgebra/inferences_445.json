        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexia designed a logo 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall to be used on her school's notebooks. The school wants the logo on the notebook to be 8 inches wide. How tall, in inches, will it be if it is enlarged proportionately?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Write a proportion to represent the relationship between the width and height of the original and enlarged logos.\n\nOriginal logo: width = 2 inches, height = 1.5 inches\nEnlarged logo: width = 8 inches, height = x inches\n\nProportion: 2/1.5 = 8/x\n\n**Step 2:** Cross-multiply to solve for x.\n\n2x = 1.5 * 8\n2x = 12\n\n**Step 3:** Divide both sides by 2 to isolate x.\n\nx = 12 / 2\nx = 6\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the width goes from 2 inches to 8 inches, it has been multiplied by 4.  If the picture is enlarged proportionately, then the height will also be multiplied by 4.  Therefore, the enlarged logo is $1.5\\times4=\\boxed{6}$ inches tall."
