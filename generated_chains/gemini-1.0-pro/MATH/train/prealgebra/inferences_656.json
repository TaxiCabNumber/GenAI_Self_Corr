At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $d$ be a positive number such that when $109$ is divided by $d$, the remainder is $4.$ Compute the sum of all possible two-digit values of $d$.",
        "inference": "Since $109 = 4 \\cdot 25 + 9,$ the value of $d$ must be a divisor of $9,$ which means that $d$ must be $1, 3, or 9.$  The sum of these three possible values of $d$ is $1 + 3 + 9 = 13.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If 4 is subtracted from 109, the result is 105. Then each of the two-digit numbers that will divide 109 with a remainder of 4 will divide 105 exactly. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding all two-digit divisors of 105. Since the prime factors of 105 are 3, 5, and 7, the divisors are $3\\times5$, $3\\times7$, and $5\\times7$, or $15, 21,\\text{and }35$ with a sum of $\\boxed{71}$."
