        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest multiple of $9$ whose negation is greater than $-100$?",
        "inference": "Let the largest multiple of 9 be $9x$.\nThen, $-9x > -100$.\nDividing both sides by $-9$, we get $x < \\frac{100}{9}$.\nTherefore, the largest value of $x$ is $11$.\nHence, the largest multiple of 9 is $9 \\times 11 = 99$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$99$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing $-100$ by $9$ gives $-11$ with a remainder of $-1$. In other words, $$-100 = -11 \\cdot 9 + (-1).$$This means that $-11 \\cdot 9 = -99$ is greater than $-100$. Because the negation of $99$ is $-99$, $\\boxed{99}$ is the largest multiple of $9$ whose negation is greater than $-100$.\n\nWe could also divide $-100$ by $9$ to get $-12$ with a positive remainder of $11$. However, $-12 \\cdot 9$ is less than $-100$, so $$-100 = -12 \\cdot 9 + 11$$would not help."
