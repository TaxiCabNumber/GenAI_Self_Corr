At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest integer less than 100 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 12 is 4?",
        "inference": "Let the integer be $n$. Then, we have $\\gcd(n, 12) = 4$. Since $\\gcd(n, 12) = 4$, we can write $n = 4k$ and $12 = 4 \\cdot 3$ for some integers $k$ and $l$. Substituting these expressions into $\\gcd(n, 12) = 4$, we get $\\gcd(4k, 4 \\cdot 3) = 4$. Since $\\gcd(4k, 4 \\cdot 3) = 4$, we have $\\gcd(k, 3) = 1$. Thus, $k$ is relatively prime to $3$. The greatest integer less than 100 for which $k$ is relatively prime to $3$ is $k = 97$. Therefore, the greatest integer less than 100 for which $\\gcd(n, 12) = 4$ is $n = 4k = 4 \\cdot 97 = \\boxed{388}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{388}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 12 is 4, that means the other number is a multiple of 4 but not 6, 12. Since the other number must an even number (multiple of 2), we start with 98 and look at decreasing even numbers. 98 is not a multiple of 4. 96 is a multiple of 6 and 12. 94 is not a multiple of 4. So, the greatest integer less than 100 that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{92}$."
