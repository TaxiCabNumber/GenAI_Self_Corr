At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA number is chosen at random from the set of consecutive natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 24\\}$. What is the probability that the number chosen is a factor of $4!$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe numbers in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 24\\}$ that are factors of $4!$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24$.\nThere are $7$ of these numbers in the set, and $24$ numbers in the set total.\nTherefore, the probability of choosing a number that is a factor of $4!$ is $\\frac{7}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number $4!=24$ has prime factorization $2^33^1$. A factor of 24 must have between zero and three 2's in its prime factorization, and between zero and one 3's in its prime factorization. Therefore, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ factors, and the probability that a number randomly chosen from the given set is a factor of 24 is $\\frac{8}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
