At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA collection of five positive integers has mean 4.4, unique mode 3 and median 4. If an 8 is added to the collection, what is the new median? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order from least to greatest. \nSince the mode is 3, we know that the collection must contain at least one 3.\n The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. \nThe mean is 4.4, so the sum of the numbers is 4.4 * 5 = 22.\nWe know that the collection contains at least one 3, so the other four numbers must add up to 19.\nSince the median is 4, we know that the two middle numbers when the numbers are arranged in order must both be 4.\nThe remaining two numbers must add up to 11 and be less than 4.\nThe only two numbers that fit this criterion are 3 and 8. \nSo, the original collection is {3, 3, 4, 4, 8}.\nWhen we add 8 to the collection, we get {3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8}.\nThe new median is the middle number when the numbers \nare arranged in order from least to greatest. \nThe new median is 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4.0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the original five positive integers, we know that the median value, or the medium-valued number, is 4. Since the unique mode is 3, there must be at least 2 threes, and since this is less than the median, we know both of the smallest numbers are 3. Finally, since the mean is 4.4, the sum of the five integers is $5\\cdot 4.4 = 22$, and $22 - 3 - 3 - 4 = 12$ is the sum of the two largest integers. And since the mode of 3 was unique, we know that the larger digits must be greater than 4, and cannot both be 6. So they must be 5 and 7. So our set of integers is $\\{ 3, 3, 4, 5, 7\\}$. By adding in an 8, we move the median to $\\frac{1}{2}(4+5) = \\boxed{4.5}$."
