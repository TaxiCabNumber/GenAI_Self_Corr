At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the area of a circle is less than $60\\pi$ square inches, what is the greatest possible integer value in inches of the radius of the circle?",
        "inference": "The formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. We want to find the greatest possible integer value of $r$ such that $A < 60\\pi$. Solving this inequality, we have:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nA &< 60\\pi\\\\\n\\pi r^2 &< 60\\pi\\\\\nr^2 &< 60\\\\\nr &< \\sqrt{60}\\\\\nr &< 2\\sqrt{15}\\\\\nr &< 7.74596669241\\\\\nr &\\le 7\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible integer value of the radius is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$.

        "ground_truth": "The area of a circle is defined as $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Since $\\pi r^2 < 60\\pi$, $r^2<60$, and since $r$ must be an integer, the greatest possible $r$ is $\\boxed{7}$ inches."
