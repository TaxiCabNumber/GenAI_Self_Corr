At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many times does the digit 9 appear in the list of all integers from 1 to 500? (The number $ 99 $, for example, is counted twice, because $9$ appears two times in it.)",
        "inference": "There are $500$ integers from $1$ to $500$.\n\nThe digit $9$ appears $100$ times in the tens place (from $19$ to $199$) and $100$ times in the units place (from $9$ to $99$) which is $200$. This counts the numbers with the digit $9$ one time. \n\nThe number $99$ appears $9$ times (that is, from $90$ to $98$).\n\nSo, the digit $9$ appears $200+9 = \\boxed{209}$ times.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{209}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The easiest approach is to consider how many times 9 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place. If we put a 9 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 5 choices for the hundreds digit (including 0), for a total of 50 times. Likewise, if we put a 9 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 5 choices for the hundreds digit, for a total of 50 times. Since 9 cannot appear in the hundreds digit, there are $50+50=\\boxed{100}$ appearances of the digit 9."
