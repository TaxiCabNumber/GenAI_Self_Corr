At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
        "inference": "The zookeeper has 4 pairs of animals, so there are 8 animals in total. He starts by feeding the male giraffe, so the next animal he feeds must be a female. There are 4 females, so there are 4 ways to choose the second animal. After choosing the second animal, there are 3 females and 3 males left, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 ways to choose the third and fourth animals. Continuing in this way, we find that there are 4 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 = 60480 ways to feed all the animals.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60480}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways."
