At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular field is half as wide as it is long, and it is completely enclosed by 54 meters of fencing. What is the number of square meters in the area of the field?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let \\(x\\) be the width of the field.\n**Step 2:** Since the length is twice the width, the length is \\(2x\\).\n**Step 3:** The perimeter of the rectangular field is two times the length plus two times the width. So, we have the following equation:\n$$2(2x) + 2x = 54.$$\n**Step 4:** Simplify the equation:\n$$4x + 2x = 54.$$\n**Step 5:** Combine like terms:\n$$6x = 54.$$\n**Step 6:** Divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n$$x = \\frac{54}{6} = 9.$$\n**Step 7:** The width of the field is 9 meters, and the length is 2(9) = 18 meters.\n**Step 8:** The area of the field is the length times the width:\n$$Area = 18 \\times 9 = 162.$$\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{162}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the rectangle's width be $w$, then its length is $2w$.  So its perimeter is $2(w + 2w) = 6w = 54$.  Thus $w = 9$, and the rectangle's area is $9(2\\cdot 9) = \\boxed{162}$ square meters."
