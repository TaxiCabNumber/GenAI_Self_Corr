At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTori's mathematics test had 75 problems: 10 arithmetic, 30 algebra, and 35 geometry problems. Although she answered $70\\%$ of the arithmetic, $40\\%$ of the algebra, and $60\\%$ of the geometry problems correctly, she did not pass the test because she got less than $60\\%$ of the problems right. How many more questions would she have needed to answer correctly to earn a $60\\%$ passing grade?",
