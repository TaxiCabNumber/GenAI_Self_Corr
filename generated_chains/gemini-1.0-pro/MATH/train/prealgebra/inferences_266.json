At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can four people sit in a row of five chairs?",
        "inference": "There are five choices for the first person, four choices for the second person, three choices for the third person, and two choices for the fourth person. So the total number of ways is $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 120$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Have the youngest sit first, then the next youngest, and so on.  The first person has 5 choices.  No matter where the first person sits, the next person has 4 choices.  No matter where the first two people sit, the third person has 3 choices.  The fourth person then has 2 choices.  Therefore, there are $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{120}$ ways for the four people to sit."
