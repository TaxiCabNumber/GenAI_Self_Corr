        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial has a height of 60 feet. A scale model of the statue has a height of 4 inches. How many feet of the statue does one inch of the model represent?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of feet that one inch of the model represents.\n\nSince the model is scaled down from the original statue, the ratio of the height of the model to the height of the statue is equal to the ratio of the number of inches in the model to the number of feet in the statue.\n\nTherefore, we have the following proportion:\n\n```\n4 / x = 60 / 12\n```\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = (4 * 12) / 60 = 8\n```\n\nTherefore, one inch of the model represents 8 feet of the statue.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio between a length on the model and a length on the statue is $4\\text{ inches}: 60\\text{ feet}$. Dividing both sides by 4, we have that 1 inch on the model corresponds to $60/4=\\boxed{15}$ feet on the statue."
