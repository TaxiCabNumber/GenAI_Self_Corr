At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ has sides of $6$ units, $8$ units, and $10$ units. The width of a rectangle, whose area is equal to the area of the triangle, is $4$ units. What is the perimeter of this rectangle, in units?",
