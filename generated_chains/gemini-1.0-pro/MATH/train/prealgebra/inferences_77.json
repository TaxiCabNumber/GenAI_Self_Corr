At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA tank is to be filled with water. When the tank is one-sixth full, 130 gallons of water are added, making the tank three-fifths full. How many gallons does the tank contain when it is completely full?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of gallons the tank can hold. One-sixth of the tank is \\( \\frac{x}{6} \\) gallons. When 130 gallons are added, the tank is three-fifths full, so \\(\\frac{x}{6} + 130 = \\frac{3x}{5}\\).\n\n$$\\begin{split}\\frac{x}{6} + 130 & = \\frac{3x}{5} \\\\\\ (5)\\left(\\frac{x}{6}+130\\right) &=(5)\\left(\\frac{3x}{5}\\right) \\\\\\ \\frac{5x}{6}+650 & = 3x \\\\\\ 3x-\\frac{5x}{6} & = 650 \\\\\\ \\frac{18x}{6}-\\frac{5x}{6} & = 650 \\\\\\ \\frac{13x}{6} & = 650 \\\\\\ \\frac{13x}{6}\\cdot\\frac{6}{13} & = 650\\cdot\\frac{6}{13} \\\\\\ x & = 300. \\end{split}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{300}.\\) I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The difference between three-fifths full and one-sixth full is $\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity.  Let $x$ be the capacity of the tank in gallons.  Since $\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity is 130 gallons, we have $\\frac{13}{30}x = 130$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{30}{13}$ gives $x = 300$, so the capacity is $\\boxed{300}$ gallons."
