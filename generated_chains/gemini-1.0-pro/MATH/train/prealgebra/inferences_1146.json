At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA car is averaging 50 miles per hour. If the car maintains this speed, how many minutes less would a 450-mile trip take than a 475-mile trip?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the time it takes to travel 450 miles:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 450 miles / 50 miles per hour = **9 hours**\n\n2. Calculate the time it takes to travel 475 miles:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 475 miles / 50 miles per hour = **9.5 hours**\n\n3. Calculate the difference in time between the two trips:\nDifference = 9.5 hours - 9 hours = **0.5 hours**\n\n4. Convert 0.5 hours to minutes:\n0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = **30 minutes**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\\\boxed{30}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The trip would be $475-450 = 25$ miles less, and it takes 30 minutes to travel 25 miles at 50 mph, (25 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of 50, and thus, it takes $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an hour) therefore, it would be $\\boxed{30}$ minutes less."
