There are $\\frac{240}{10}=24$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, find the number of positive integers less than $250$ that are multiples of $5$ and also multiples of $10$.

There are $\\frac{240}{10}=24$ such numbers.\n\nThe number of positive integers less than $250$ that are multiples of $5$, but not multiples of $10$ is $49-24=\\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.

They have a units digit of $5$.\n\nThe largest number below $250$ with a units digit of $5$ is $245$.  All of these multiples are in the form $\\_\\_5$, where the blank can be filled with an integer between $0$ and $24$, inclusive.  Therefore our answer is the number of integers between $0$ and $24$.
