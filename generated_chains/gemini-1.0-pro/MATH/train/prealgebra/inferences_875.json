We're only interested in numbers that are divisible by $3$, and the list of such numbers is $$63, 66, 69, \\ldots, 210, 213.$$ To count the number of numbers in this list, first divide each by $3$. Our list then becomes $$21, 22, 23, \\ldots, 70, 71.$$ Finally, subtract $20$ from each number, and the list becomes $$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50, 51.$$ Thus, there are $\\boxed{51}$ multiples of $3$ between $62$ and $215$."
