At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJuan takes a number, adds $2$ to it, multiplies the answer by $2$, subtracts $2$ from the result, and finally divides that number by $2$. If his answer is $7$, what was the original number?",
