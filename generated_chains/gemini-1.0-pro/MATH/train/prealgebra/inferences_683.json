At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA list of five positive integers has a median of 3 and a mean of 11. What is the maximum possible value of the list's largest element?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The median of a list is the middle value when the list is sorted in ascending order. Since the median is 3, the list can be [3, a, b, c, d] where a, b, c, and d are positive integers.\n\n**Step 2:** The mean of a list is the sum of all the elements divided by the number of elements. For the given list, the mean is 11 so we have:\n$$\\frac{3+a+b+c+d}{5}=11$$\nSimplifying:\n$$3+a+b+c+d=55$$\n\n**Step 3:** We want to find the maximum possible value of d. To do this, we need to make a and b as small as possible while still satisfying the mean equation. Since a and b are positive integers, the smallest possible value for each is 1. This gives us:\n$$3+1+1+c+d=55$$\nSimplifying:\n$$c+d=50$$\n\n**Step 4:** We now need to find the largest possible value of d while satisfying the above equation. Since c must be a positive integer, the largest possible value of d is 49.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$49$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the 5 numbers have a mean of 11, the sum of the numbers is $5\\cdot 11 = 55$.  To make the largest number as large as possible, we make the other numbers must be as small as possible.  However, in order for the median to be 3, the middle number must be 3.  Since this is the middle number, there must be two other numbers that are at least 3.  So, we let three of the other four numbers be 1, 1, and 3 to make them as small as possible.  Finally, this means the remaining number is $55-1-1-3-3=\\boxed{47}$."
