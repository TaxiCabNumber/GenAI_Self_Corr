At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice chose five positive integers and found that their product was even. What is the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen?",

If a is even, then the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4. If b is even, then the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4. If c is even, then the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4. If d is even, then the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4. If e is even, then the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4. Therefore, the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}.
