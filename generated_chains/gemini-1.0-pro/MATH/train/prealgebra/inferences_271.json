At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three integers be $x,y,z$. Then $xyz=7^3=343$. Since $x,y,z$ are all positive, they must be factors of $343$. The factors of $343$ are $1,7,49,343$. Since the integers are different, we have the following cases:\n\nCase 1: $x=1,y=7,z=49$. The sum of the three integers is $1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$.\n\nCase 2: $x=1,y=49,z=343$. The sum of the three integers is $1+49+343=\\boxed{401}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{57}$ or $\\boxed{401}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$."
