At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different 7-digit positive integers exist? (Note that we don't allow \"7-digit\" integers that start with 0, such as 0123456; this is actually a 6-digit integer.)",

For each of these choices, there are 10 choices for the third digit, and so on. Therefore, the total number of different 7-digit positive integers is:\n\n10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10^7\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10000000}. I hope it is correct.",
