At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $x$ is a positive multiple of 8 and $x^2>100$, but $x<20$, what is $x$?",
        "inference": "Since $x$ is a positive multiple of 8, we can write $x=8k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nWe are given that $x^2>100$, so $(8k)^2>100$. Simplifying, $64k^2>100$. Dividing both sides by 64, we get $k^2>1.5625$.\n\nWe are also given that $x<20$, so $8k<20$. Dividing both sides by 8, we get $k<2.5$.\n\nTherefore, $k$ must be an integer between 2 and 2.5. The only integer between 2 and 2.5 is 2.\n\nSubstituting $k=2$ into $x=8k$, we get $x=8(2)=\\boxed{16}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "This question gives multiple clues on what $x$ could be. Because $x^2>100$, we know that $x$ must be greater than 10, but $x$ is also less than 20. So $x$ is a multiple of 8 that is between 10 and 20. The only value that fits this description is $\\boxed{16}$."
