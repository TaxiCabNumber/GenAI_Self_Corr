At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the diagram, the rectangle has a width $w$, a length of $8$, and a perimeter of $24$. What is the ratio of its width to its length? [asy]\npair a = (0, 0); pair b = (8, 0); pair c = (8, 4); pair d = (0, 4);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--cycle);\nlabel(\"$w$\", midpoint(a--d), W); label(\"$8$\", midpoint(c--d), N);\n[/asy] Write your answer in the form $x:y$, where $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime positive integers.",
        "inference": "Since the perimeter of the rectangle is $24$, we have the equation $$2(w + 8) = 24.$$ Solving for $w$, we get $$w + 8 = 12.$$ Subtracting $8$ from both sides, we get $$w = 4.$$ Therefore, the ratio of the width to the length is $$\\boxed{(w:l) = 4:8=1:2}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1:2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the rectangle has width $w$, length 8, and perimeter 24, then $2w+2(8)=24$ or $2w+16=24$ or $2w=8$ or $w=4$. Therefore, the ratio of the width to the length is $4 : 8 = \\boxed{1 : 2}$."
