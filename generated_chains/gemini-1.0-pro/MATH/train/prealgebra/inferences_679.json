At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo identical CDs regularly cost a total of $\\$28.$ What is the cost in dollars of five of these CDs?",

        "ground_truth": "In general, 5 CDs will cost $\\frac{5}{2}$ times as much as 2 CDs.  Thus the desired cost is $28\\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = \\boxed{70}$ dollars."
