        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many two-digit prime numbers can be formed by choosing two different digits from the set $\\{2, 7, 8, 9\\}$ to be used as the tens digit and units digit?",
        "inference": "We can choose the tens digit in 4 ways and for each of these choices, we can choose the units digit in 3 ways. Therefore, the number of two-digit prime numbers that can be formed is $4\\times3=\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We immediately note that if 2 is the units digit, then the number is composite. If 2 is the tens digit, only 29 is prime. If 7 is the tens digit, only 79 is prime. If 8 is the tens digit, only 89 is prime. Finally, if 9 is the tens digit, only 97 is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ two-digit primes can be formed."
