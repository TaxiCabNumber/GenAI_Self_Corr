        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTracy had a bag of candies, and none of the candies could be broken into pieces. She ate $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them and then gave $\\frac{1}{4}$ of what remained to her friend Rachel. Tracy and her mom then each ate 15 candies from what Tracy had left. Finally, Tracy's brother took somewhere from one to five candies, leaving Tracy with three candies. How many candies did Tracy have at the start?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Let's start by representing the total number of candies with $x$.\n\nStep 2: Tracy ate 1/3 of the candies, so she ate $\\frac{1}{3}x$ candies.\nAfter this, she gave $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the remaining candies to her friend Rachel. So, Rachel received $\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x - \\frac{1}{3}x\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right) = \\frac{1}{6}x$ candies.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, Tracy had $\\left(x - \\frac{1}{3}x\\right) - \\frac{1}{6}x = \\frac{5}{6}x$ candies left after giving some to Rachel. Tracy and her mom then each ate 15 candies, so $2\\cdot 15 = 30$ candies were removed from what Tracy had left.\n\nStep 4: So, Tracy had $\\frac{5}{6}x - 30$ candies remaining. Tracy's brother then took some candies from this pile, reducing it to three candies. Therefore, the number of candies Tracy's brother took is:\n$Brother's candies = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}x - 30\\right) - 3 = \\frac{5}{6}x - 33.$\n\nStep 5: The problem states that the number of candies Tracy's brother took is between 1 and 5. So, we can set up the following inequality and solve for x:\n$1 \\leq \\frac{5}{6}x - 33 \\leq 5$\n\nStep 6: Adding 33 to all sides, we get:\n$34 \\leq \\frac{5}{6}x \\leq 38$\n\nStep 7: Multiplying all sides by $\\frac{6}{5}$ to isolate x, we get:\n$68 \\leq x \\leq 72$\n\nStep 8: Since x represents the number of candies at the start, which must be a whole number, the only possible solution is $x = 69$. Therefore, Tracy had $x = 69$ candies at the start.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{69}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be Tracy's starting number of candies. After eating $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them, she had $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left. Since $\\frac{2}{3}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 3. After giving $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this to Rachel, she had $\\frac{3}{4}$ of $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left, for a total of $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{1}{2}x$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 2. Since $x$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.\n\nAfter Tracy and her mom each ate 15 candies (they ate a total of 30), Tracy had $\\frac{1}{2}x - 30$ candies left. After her brother took 1 to 5 candies, Tracy was left with 3. This means Tracy had 4 to 8 candies before her brother took some candies. Hence,  $$\n4 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x - 30 \\le 8\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 34 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x \\le 38\\qquad  \\Rightarrow \\qquad 68 \\le x \\le 76.\n$$Since $x$ is divisible by 6, and the only multiple of 6 in the above range is 72, we have $x = \\boxed{72}$."
