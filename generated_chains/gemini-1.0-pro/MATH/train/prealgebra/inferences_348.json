        "inference": "Let's call the length of one side of the square 'x'.\n\nThe perimeter of the square is 144 units, so 4x = 144.\nSolving for x, we get x = 36.\n\nEach rectangle is made up of two sides of the square. The perimeter of one rectangle is therefore 2x + 2x = 4x.\n\nSubstituting x = 36, we get the perimeter of one rectangle is 4(36) = 144 units.\n```\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{144}.

        "ground_truth": "Problem 5. Let's call the side length of the square $s$. This makes the perimeter of the square $4s$, which we know is 144 units. Solving $4s = 144$ for  $s$, we get $s = 36$. We also can say that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(s + 0.25s)$. Since we found that $s = 36$, we know that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(36 + (0.25)(36)) = \\boxed{90\\text{ units}}$."
