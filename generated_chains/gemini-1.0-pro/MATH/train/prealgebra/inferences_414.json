At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf I have four boxes arranged in a $2$ x $2$ grid, in how many distinct ways can I place the digits $1$, $2$, and $3$ in the boxes such that each box contains at most one digit?  (I only have one of each digit, so one box will remain blank.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. There are 4 ways to choose the box for digit $1$.\n2. Once digit $1$ is placed, there are 3 ways to choose the box for digit $2$.\n3. Once digit $2$ is placed, there are 2 ways to choose the box for digit $3$.\n4. There is $1$ way to leave the last box blank.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways to place the digits is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{24}.$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can think of placing a $0$ in the fourth box that will necessarily be empty. Now the problem is simple: we have four choices of digits for the first box, three for the second, two for the third, and one for the last. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ distinct ways to fill the boxes."
