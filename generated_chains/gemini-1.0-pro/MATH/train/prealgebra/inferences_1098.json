At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sports conference has 14 teams in two divisions of 7.  How many games are in a complete season for the conference if each team must play every other team in its own division twice and every team in the other division once?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* Each team in a division plays each other team in its own division twice.  So, each team plays 6 games within its own division.\n* Since there are 7 teams in each division, there are 14 games within each division.\n* Each team in one division plays each team in the other division once.  So, each team plays 7 games against teams in the other division.\n* There are 14 teams in the conference, so there are 14 * 7 = 98 games between teams in different divisions.\n* Therefore, the total number of games in a complete season is 98 + 14 + 14 = 126.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{126}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Each team plays 6 other teams in its division twice, and the 7 teams in the other division once, for a total of $6 \\times 2 + 7 = 19$ games for each team.  There are 14 teams total, which gives a preliminary count of $19 \\times 14 = 266$ games, but we must divide by two because we have counted each game twice (once for one team and once for the other).  So the final answer is $\\dfrac{19 \\times 14}{2} = \\boxed{133}$ games."
