        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many values of the digit $A$ is it true that $63$ is divisible by $A$ and $273{,}1A2$ is divisible by $4$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**\n\n63 is divisible by A, therefore A is a divisor of 63. Two divisors of 63 are 3 and 7.\n\n**Step 2**\n\n273,1A2 is divisible by 4, therefore the last two digits of 273,1A2 form a number that is divisible by 4. Thus, A1 and A2 are such that 10A1 + A2 is divisible by 4. It is true if the last two digits of 10A1 + A2 are divisible by 4 because every multiple of 4 has last two digits divisible by 4. The last two digits of 10A1 + A2 are divisible by 4 if 10A1 + A2 ends in 00, 04, 08, or 12. The only way that 10A1 + A2 can end in 00 is if A1 and A2 are both 0. The only way that 10A1 + A2 can end in 04 is if A1 = 2 and A2 = 0, or if A1 = 6 and A2 = 4. The only way that 10A1 + A2 can end in 08 is if A1 = 4 and A2 = 0, or if A1 = 8 and A2 = 4. The only way that 10A1 + A2 can end in 12 is if A1 = 6 and A2 = 0, or if A1 = 0 and A2 = 4.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nThere are **\\boxed{$4$}.

        "ground_truth": "In order for the number $273{,}1A2$ to be divisible by $4,$ the last two digits must be divisible by $4.$ The multiples of $4$ less than $100$ that end with the digit $2$ are $12,$ $32,$ $52,$ $72,$ and $92.$ This gives us five possibilities for $A$: $1,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ and $9.$\n\nOf these, all but the number $5$ are divisors of $63,$ so we have that $A$ could be $1,$ $3,$ $7,$ or $9.$ Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ values of $A$ such that $63$ is divisible by $A$ and $273{,}1A2$ is divisible by 4."
