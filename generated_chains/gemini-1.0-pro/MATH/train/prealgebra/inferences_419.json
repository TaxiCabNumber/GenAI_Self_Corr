Since $ADEB$ is a right triangle, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 = 24$ square units. Therefore, the area of pentagon $AEDCB$ is the sum of the areas of rectangle $AEDC$ and triangle $ADEB$, which is $48 + 24 = \\boxed{72}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}.$ I hope it is correct.",

The area of triangle $ADE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8=3 \\cdot 8=24$. Finally, we calculate the area of pentagon $ABCDE$ to be the difference of the two: $100-24=\\boxed{76} \\text{ sq units}$."
