At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the value of $y$ is doubled and then this increased value is divided by 5, the result is 10. What is the value of $y$?",
        "inference": "Let's think step by step.\nLet the value of $y$ be $x$.\nThen, we have:\n$$\\frac{2x}{5}=10$$\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n$$2x=50$$\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n$$x=25$$\nTherefore, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.
