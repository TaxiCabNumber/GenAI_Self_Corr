At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRound $3.45$ to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "The digit in the hundredths place is 5. The digit in the tenths place is 4. Since 5 is greater than or equal to 5, we round up the digit in the tenths place by 1.\n\nSo, $3.45$ rounded to the nearest tenth is $3.5$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$3.5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number $3.45$ is just as close to $3.4$ as it is to $3.5$, and the rules for rounding say that in this case we round up. Thus $\\boxed{3.5}$ is our answer."
