At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne US dollar is the equivalent of 7 Namibian dollars.  One US dollar is also the equivalent of 6 Chinese yuan. If a painting costs 105 Namibian dollars, how much would it cost in Chinese yuan?",
