        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe wants to find all the four-letter words that begin and end with the same letter. How many combinations of letters satisfy this property?",
        "inference": "The first and last letters can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet. The middle two letters can be any of the remaining 25 letters. Therefore, there are 26 * 25 * 25 * 26 = 437,500 combinations of letters that satisfy this property.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{437,500}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $26$ choices for the first letter, $26$ for the second, and $26$ for the third. The last letter is determined by the first letter. Thus, there are $26^3 = \\boxed{17576}$ such combinations."
