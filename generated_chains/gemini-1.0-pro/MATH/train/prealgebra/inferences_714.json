At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo promote her school's annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. For her small kite, Genevieve draws the kite on a grid with the points one inch apart, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nfor ( int x = 0; x <= 6; ++x )\n{\n\nfor ( int y = 0; y <= 7; ++y )\n\n{\n\ndot((x,y));\n\n}\n}\ndraw((0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--(3,0)--cycle);\n[/asy]\n\nFor the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.\n\nWhat is the number of square inches in the area of the small kite?",
        "inference": "* The small kite has a height of 7 inches and a width of 6 inches.\n* The area of the small kite is $7 \\times 6 = 42$ square inches.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{42}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The kite can be divided into two triangles, each with base 7 and altitude 3.  Each area is $(1/2)(7)(3) = 10.5$, so the total area is $2(10.5) = \\boxed{21}$ square inches."
