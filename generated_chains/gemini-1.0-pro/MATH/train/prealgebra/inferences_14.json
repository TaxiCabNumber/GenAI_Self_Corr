At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 56 meters. The ratio of its length to its width is 4:3. What is the length in meters of a diagonal of the rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be the length and the width of the rectangle respectively. We are given that \\(x:y=4:3\\). Let \\(x=4k\\) and \\(y=3k\\). Then the perimeter is\n$$2(x+y)=2(4k+3k)=56\\Rightarrow 14k=56\\Rightarrow k=4.$$\n\nTherefore \\(x=4k=4\\cdot 4=16\\) and \\(y=3k=3\\cdot 4=12.\\) Therefore, the diagonal is \\(d=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{16^2+12^2}=\\sqrt{400}=20.\\)\n$\\\\~\\\\$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the rectangle's length is $4l$, then it's width is $3l$.  Then its perimeter is $14l = 56$, meaning that $l = 4$.  Finally, the rectangle's diagonal is $\\sqrt{(4l)^2 + (3l)^2} = 5l = \\boxed{20}$."
