        "ground_truth": "Since $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ and $3$ is relatively prime with $8$ while $2$ divides into both $6$ and $8$, it follows that $\\text{gcd}(6,8) = 2$. The multiples of $8$ are $8, 16, 24, 32\\ldots$ and the multiples of $6$ are $6, 12, 18, 24, 30, \\ldots$, so $\\text{lcm}(6,8) = 24$.
