        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJordan wants to divide his $\\frac{48}{5}$ pounds of chocolate into $4$ piles of equal weight.  If he gives one of these piles to his friend Shaina, how many pounds of chocolate will Shaina get?",
        "inference": "1. Divide the total weight of chocolate by the number of piles to get the weight of each pile: $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4 = \\frac{48}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{12}{5}$ pounds.\n2. Since Jordan gives one pile to Shaina, she will get $\\frac{12}{5}$ pounds of chocolate.\n3. Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We need to divide the amount of chocolate Jordan has by the the number of piles, so our expression is $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$.  Recall that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  Therefore, $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$ is the same thing as $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}.$ We can rewrite $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 48 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$, or $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$. To simplify this, divide $48$ by $4$, which equals $12$. Our previous expression, $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$, then equals $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 12$, which comes to $\\frac{12}{5}$.  So Shaina will receive $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$ pounds of chocolate."
