At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old, how many years old is the oldest child?",
        "inference": "Let x be the age of the oldest child. Then the total age of the three children is 4 + 7 + x = 11 + x. Since the average age is 7 years, we have:\n$$\\frac{11 + x}{3} = 7$$\nSolving for x, we get:\n$$11 + x = 21$$\n$$x = 21 - 11$$\n$$x = 10$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the age of the oldest child be $x$. We are told that $\\frac{4 + 7 + x}{3} = 7$. Multiplying by 3, we see that $11 + x = 21$. We conclude that $x = \\boxed{10}$."
