        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe distance from Goteborg to Jonkiping on a map is 88 cm. The scale on the map is 1 cm: 15 km. How far is it between the two city centers, in kilometers?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the distance on the map to kilometers: 88 cm / 1 cm * 15 km = 1320 km.\n2. Therefore, the distance between the two city centers is: 1320 km.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1320$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If one centimeter on the map is 15 kilometers in reality, then we have the ratio $1 \\text{ cm on map} : 15 \\text{ km in reality}$. Multiplying the ratio by 88, we get $88 \\text{ cm on map} : 15 \\cdot 88 \\text{ km in reality} =88 \\text{ cm on map} : 1320 \\text{ km in reality}$. Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{1320}$ kilometers apart."
