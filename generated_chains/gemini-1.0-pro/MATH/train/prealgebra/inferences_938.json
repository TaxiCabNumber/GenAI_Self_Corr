At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many numbers are in the following list: $$-4, -1, 2, 5,\\ldots, 32$$",
        "inference": "To find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula:\n$$n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d}+1$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of terms, $a_n$ is the last term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n$$a_n = 32, a_1 = -4, d = 3$$\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$n = \\frac{32 - (-4)}{3}+1$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$n = \\frac{36}{3}+1$$\n$$n = 12+1$$\n$$n = 13$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.",
