At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a class of $40$ students, $18$ said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $12$ said they did not like either. How many students in the class liked both?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of students who liked both. Then, the number of students who only liked apple pie is $18-x$, and the number of students who only liked chocolate cake is $15-x$. Since there are $40$ students in the class, we have\n\n$$x+(18-x)+(15-x)+12=40$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get\n\n$$x+18-x+15-x+12=40$$\n\n$$45-x=40$$\n\n$$x=45-40$$\n\n$$x=\\boxed{5}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the $40$ students, $12$ did not like either dessert. Therefore, $40-12=28$ students liked at least one of the desserts. But $18$ students said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $18+15=33,$ so $33-28=\\boxed{5}$ students must have liked both of the desserts."
