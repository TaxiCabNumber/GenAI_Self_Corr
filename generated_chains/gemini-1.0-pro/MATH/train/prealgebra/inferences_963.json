        "ground_truth": "Since the angle measures are in the ratio $5:6:7$, the measures are $5x$, $6x$, and $7x$ for some value of $x$.  Since these are the angles of a triangle, we have $5x+6x+7x = 180^\\circ$, so $18x = 180^\\circ$ and $x = 10^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle is $7x = \\boxed{70^\\circ}$."
