At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle and a square have the same perimeter of 12 inches. What is the ratio of the side length of the triangle to the side length of the square? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Then, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= y\\\\\n3x &= 4y\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving for y in the first equation, we get\n\n$$y = x$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get\n\n$$3x = 4x\\\\\nx = 0$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution to this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**: No solution",
        "ground_truth": "They have the same perimeter, but that is divided among 4 sides for a square, and 3 sides for an equilateral triangle, and thus, the triangle's side length is $\\frac{4}{3}$ times as long as that of the square.\n\nTo be more precise, you can call $t$ the side length of the equilateral triangle, and $s$ the side length of the square, and set up the equations: $3t = 12$, and $4s = 12$, which yields $t = 4$, and $s = 3$, from which it is clear that the ratio of the side length of the triangle to that of the square is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$."
