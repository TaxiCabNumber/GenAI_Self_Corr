At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls.  A ball is drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that the ball is white?",
        "inference": "The probability of drawing a white ball from a box containing 5 white balls and 6 black balls is the ratio of the number of white balls to the total number of balls:\n\n```\nProbability = Number of white balls / Total number of balls\n```\n\nIn this case, the probability is:\n\n```\nProbability = 5 / (5 + 6)\n```\n\n```\nProbability = 5 / 11\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{11}$}. I hope it is correct.",
