At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square inches, of a right triangle with a 24-inch leg and a 25-inch hypotenuse?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} * base * height$$\n \nIn this case, the base is 24 inches and the height is the length of the other leg, which we don't know. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find it:\n$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n \nwhere a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we have:\n$$24^2 + b^2 = 25^2$$\n \nSolving for b, we get:\n$$b^2 = 25^2 - 24^2 = 49$$\n \n$$b = \\sqrt{49} = 7$$\n \nSo, the height of the triangle is 7 inches. Now we can plug this into the formula for the area:\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} * 24 * 7 = 84$$\n \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The other leg is $\\sqrt{25^2-24^2}=\\sqrt{625-576}=\\sqrt{49}=7$. The area is $\\frac12\\cdot24\\cdot7=12\\cdot7=\\boxed{84}$ square inches."
