At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven identical bowling balls weigh the same as three identical canoes. If one of the canoes weighs a total of 28 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
        "inference": "Let x be the weight of one bowling ball. Then the weight of three canoes is 3x. Since one canoe weighs 28 pounds, we have:\n3x = 3 * 28 = 84\nTherefore, the weight of one bowling ball is x = 84 / 3 = 28 pounds.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{28}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If one canoe weighs 28 pounds, then three canoes weigh $3\\times 28$ pounds, and thus seven bowling balls weigh $3\\times 28$ pounds, and thus one bowling ball weighs $\\dfrac{3\\times 28}{7} = 3\\times 4 = \\boxed{12}$ pounds."
