        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy three friends and I have dinner together every weekend. Each weekend, two of us cook and the other two clean up afterwards. How many different ways are there for us to choose who cooks and who cleans?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** We have 4 people to choose from.\n\n**Step 2:** We need to choose 2 people to cook. We can do this in 4 choose 2 ways.\n\n**Step 3:** The remaining 2 people must clean up.\n\n**Step 4:** So, the total number of ways to choose who cooks and who cleans is:\n\n4 choose 2 = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are four ways to choose the first cook and three ways to choose the second cook, but this counts every pair of cooks twice since order doesn't matter. Once the cooks are chosen, the two people left over are the cleaners. So, there are $(4\\cdot 3)/2=\\boxed{6}$ ways for us to choose who cooks and who cleans."
