At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 4 representatives from each of 4 companies at a convention. At the start of the convention, every person shakes hands once with every person except the other representatives from their company. How many handshakes are there?",

In multiplying $16 \\times 12$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\\dfrac{16 \\times 12}{2} = \\boxed{96}$ handshakes."
