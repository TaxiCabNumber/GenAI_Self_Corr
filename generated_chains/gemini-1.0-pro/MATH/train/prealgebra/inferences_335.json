        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAllen and Ben are painting a fence. The ratio of the amount of work Allen does to the amount of work Ben does is $3:5$. If the fence requires a total of $240$ square feet to be painted, how many square feet does Ben paint?",
        "inference": "**Let's think step by step.**\nIf the ratio of Allen's work to Ben's work is 3:5, let's assume that Allen paints $3x$ square feet and Ben paints $5x$ square feet.  \nSince the total fence to be painted is $240$ square feet, we have: \n$$3x+5x=240$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:  \n$$8x=240$$\n\nDividing both sides by $8$, we get:  \n$$x=30$$\n\nTherefore, Ben paints $5x=5(30)=\\boxed{150}$ square feet.\n\n**Final Answer: $150$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Between them, Allen and Ben are dividing the work into $8$ equal parts, $3$ of which Allen does and $5$ of which Ben does. Each part of the work requires $\\frac{240}{8} = 30$ square feet to be painted. Since Ben does $5$ parts of the work, he will paint $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ square feet of the fence."
