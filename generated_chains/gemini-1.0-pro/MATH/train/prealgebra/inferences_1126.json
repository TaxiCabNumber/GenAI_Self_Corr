At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has side lengths of 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle:\nSemi-perimeter = (8 + 15 + 17) / 2 = 20\n**Step 2:** Apply Heron's formula to find the area:\nArea = sqrt(20*(20-8)*(20-15)*(20-17))\n**Step 3:** Simplify the expression:\nArea = sqrt(20*12*5*3)\n**Step 4:** Perform the multiplication within the square root:\nArea = sqrt(3600)\n**Step 5:** Take the square root:\nArea = 60\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$60$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $8^2+15^2=64+225=289=17^2$.  So the triangle is a right triangle with legs $8$ and $15$, and thus its area is\n\n$$\\frac{8(15)}{2}=\\boxed{60}$$"
