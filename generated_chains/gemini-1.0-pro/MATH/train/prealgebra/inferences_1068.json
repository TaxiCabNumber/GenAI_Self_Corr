At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of a game, each of the five members of a basketball team shake hands with each of the five members of the other team, and all of the players shake hands with the two referees. How many handshakes occur?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Each of the five players on the first basketball team shakes hands with each of the five players on the second team. \n**Solution**: Therefore, the number of handshakes is $5 \\times 5 = 25$ handshakes. \n\n\n**Step 2**: Each of the 10 players shakes hands with the two referees.\n**Solution**: Therefore, the number of handshakes made with the referees is $10 \\times 2 = 20$ handshakes. \n\n\n**Step 3**: Add the number of handshakes between the two teams and the handshakes with the referees.\n**Solution**: The total number of handshakes is $25 + 20 = 45$ handshakes. \n\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider the five members of one team shaking hands with each of the five members of the other team, we can simply count the number of hands the members of one team shake, since this will necessarily count all of the handshakes of the other team. Thus, as each of the five people shakes five hands, this gives $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ handshakes. There are ten basketball players total, and if each shakes hands with two referees, this gives $10 \\cdot 2 = 20$ more handshakes. Thus, a total of $25 + 20 = \\boxed{45}$ handshakes occur."
