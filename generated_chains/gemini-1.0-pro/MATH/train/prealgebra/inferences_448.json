There are 24 students taking algebra. There are 11 students who are taking drafting only. How many students are taking algebra or drafting but not both?",

Let the number of students who only take drafting be y.\n\nWe can draw a Venn diagram to represent the situation:\n\n[Image of a Venn diagram with three circles: Algebra, Drafting, and Both. The number of students in the Algebra circle is 24. The number of students in the Drafting circle is 11. The number of students in the Both circle is 10.]\n\nWe know that the number of students who are taking algebra or drafting but not both is the sum of the number of students who are only taking algebra and the number of students who are only taking drafting:\n\n$$x + y = 24 - 10 + 11 = 25$$\n\nSo the number of students who are taking algebra or drafting but not both is $\\boxed{25}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}.$ I hope it is correct.",
