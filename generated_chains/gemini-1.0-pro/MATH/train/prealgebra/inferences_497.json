        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common factor of the numbers 2835 and 8960?",
        "inference": "The prime factors of 2835 are: 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11\n\nThe prime factors of 8960 are: 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 11 * 13\n\nThe common prime factors are 3, 5, and 11.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common factor of 2835 and 8960 is 3 * 5 * 11 = 165.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{165}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We notice immediately that both terms are divisible by $5$: $2835 = 5 \\cdot 567$ and $8960 = 5 \\cdot 1792$. Repeatedly dividing 1792 by 2,  we find that $1792/2^8 = 7$, so $8960 = 2^8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. At this point, we are almost done: we know that $2$ does not divide into $2835$, so the only other factor we need to check is $7$. Since $2835 = 28 \\cdot 100 + 35$ is clearly divisible by $7$, then the greatest common factor is $5 \\times 7 = \\boxed{35}$."
