At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDave's sister baked $3$ dozen pies of which half contained chocolate, two thirds contained marshmallows, three-fourths contained cayenne, and one-sixths contained salted soy nuts.  What is the largest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of pies that had none of these ingredients. Then, the number of pies that contained chocolate is $36/2 = 18$, the number of pies that contained marshmallows is $36 * 2/3 = 24$, the number of pies that contained cayenne is $36 * 3/4 = 27$, and the number of pies that contained salted soy nuts is $36/6 = 6$. Since each pie can only contain one ingredient, the largest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients is $36 - (18 + 24 + 27 + 6) = -9$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "She baked 36 pies.  Of these\n\n1. $\\frac12\\cdot36=18$ contained chocolate\n\n2. $\\frac23\\cdot36=24$ contained marshmallows\n\n3. $\\frac34\\cdot36=27$ contained cayenne\n\n4. $\\frac16\\cdot36=6$  contained salted soy nuts.\n\n\n\nAt most 9 pies do not contain cayenne.  It is possible, however that all of the chocolate, marshmallow, and salted soy nut pies are among the other 27 pies, so there could be at most $\\boxed{9}$ pies without any of these ingredients."
