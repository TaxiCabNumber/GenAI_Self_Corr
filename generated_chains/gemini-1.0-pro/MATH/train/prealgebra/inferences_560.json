At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf an integer is divisible by $4$ and the sum of its last two digits is $13$, then what is the product of its last two digits?",
        "inference": "Let the integer be $100x+10y+z$.\n\nSince the integer is divisible by $4$, $z$ must be $0$, $4$, or $8$.\n\nSince the sum of the last two digits is $13$, $y+z=13$.\n\nThe product of the last two digits is $yz$.\n\nIf $z=0$, then $y=13$, and $yz=0$.\n\nIf $z=4$, then $y=9$, and $yz=36$.\n\nIf $z=8$, then $y=5$, and $yz=40$.\n\nTherefore, the product of the last two digits is $0$, $36$, or $40$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0,36,40}$.

        "ground_truth": "If $A$ is the tens digit and $B$ the units digit, then the two-digit number $AB$ (having $A$ in the tens place and $B$ in the units place) must be one of the following: $49$, $58$, $67$, $76$, $85$, $94$.  Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$.  So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\\cdot B = 7\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{42}$."
