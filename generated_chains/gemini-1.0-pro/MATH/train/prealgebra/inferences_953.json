At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diagonals of a rhombus are $10$ inches and $24$ inches. What is the perimeter of the rhombus, in inches?",
        "inference": "The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles and divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. \n\nLet's call the length of each side of the rhombus $s$. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the value of $s$:\n\n$$s^2 + s^2 = 10^2$$\n\n$$2s^2 = 100$$\n\n$$s^2 = 50$$\n\n$$s = 5\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nThe perimeter of the rhombus is $4s$, so the perimeter is \n\n$$4(5\\sqrt{2}) = 20\\sqrt{2} \\approx 28.28$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$28.28$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, so therefore the side length of the rhombus can be calculated as $\\sqrt{5^2+12^2} = 13$. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4 \\times 13 = \\boxed{52}$ inches."
