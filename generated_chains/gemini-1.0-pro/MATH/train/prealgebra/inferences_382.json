        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty gremlins and fifteen imps are at the Annual Mischief Convention. The imps have had a lot of in-fighting lately and refuse to shake hands with each other, but they readily shake hands with all of the gremlins. Meanwhile, all the gremlins are quite friendly and shake hands with all of the other gremlins as well as imps. Each pair of creatures shakes hands at most once. How many handshakes were at the convention?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: The imps only shake hands with the gremlins. Each of the 15 imps shakes hands with 20 gremlins, so the imps shake hands a total of \\(15 \\times 20 = 300\\) times.\n\n**Step 2**: The gremlins shake hands with each other and with the imps. There are 20 gremlins, and each gremlin shakes hands with the other 19 gremlins. This means that each gremlin participates in \\(19\\) handshakes. Therefore, all of the gremlins together participate in \\(20 \\times 19 = 380\\) handshakes.\n\n**Step 3**: We have counted the handshake between each pair of creatures twice (once when we counted the handshakes involving the first creature, and once when we counted the handshakes involving the second creature). So, to get the total number of handshakes, we divide the sum of the number of handshakes involving the imps and the number of handshakes involving the gremlins by 2.\n$$\\frac{300 + 380}{2}=340$$\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{340}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us first count the handshakes between two gremlins. There are $20$ gremlins, so there must be $\\dfrac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} = 190$ handshakes between two gremlins, making sure to divide by two to avoid over-counting.\n\nMeanwhile, there are $15$ imps that shake hands with each of the $20$ gremlins, which makes $15 \\cdot 20 = 300$ handshakes between imps and gremlins.\n\nAdding them up, we have $300 + 190 = \\boxed{490}$ total handshakes."
