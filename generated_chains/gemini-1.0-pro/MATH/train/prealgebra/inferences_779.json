At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMalcolm can run a race at a speed of 6 minutes per mile, while Joshua runs at 8 minutes per mile. In a 10-mile race, how many minutes after Malcolm crosses the finish line will Joshua cross the finish line if they start the race together?",
        "inference": "**Malcolm's time to finish the race:** \n10 miles * 6 minutes/mile = 60 minutes\n\n**Joshua's time to finish the race:** \n10 miles * 8 minutes/mile = 80 minutes\n\n**The difference in their finishing times:** \n80 minutes - 60 minutes = 20 minutes\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$20$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Malcolm will take $6 \\cdot 10 = 60$ minutes to finish the race, and Joshua will take $8 \\cdot 10 = 80$ minutes to finish the race. Thus, Joshua will cross the finish line $80 - 60 = \\boxed{20}$ minutes after Malcolm."
