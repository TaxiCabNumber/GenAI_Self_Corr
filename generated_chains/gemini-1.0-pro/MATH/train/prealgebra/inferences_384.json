        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a spelling bee $50\\%$ of the students were eliminated after the first round. Only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining students were still in the contest after the second round. If 24 students were still in the contest after the second round, how many students began the contest?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of students who began the contest.\n\nAfter the first round, 50% of the students were eliminated, so there were \\(0.5x\\) students remaining.\n\nAfter the second round, only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining students were still in the contest, so there were \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.5x = 0.1667x\\) students remaining.\n\nWe know that 24 students were still in the contest after the second round, so we can set up the equation \\(0.1667x = 24\\) and solve for \\(x\\).\n\n$$0.1667x = 24$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{24}{0.1667}$$\n\n$$x = 144$$\n\nTherefore, there were $\\boxed{144}$ students who began the contest.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{144}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first round reduced the number of students by $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the second round reduced the number of students by $\\frac{1}{3}$.  After both reductions, $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the students who began the contest remain.  Therefore, $24\\cdot6=\\boxed{144}$ students began the contest."
