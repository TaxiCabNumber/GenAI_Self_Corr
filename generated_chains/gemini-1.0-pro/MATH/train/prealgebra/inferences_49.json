        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of butter:flour:sugar in a recipe is 1:6:4. When using 8 cups of sugar in this recipe, how many total cups of these three ingredients will be used?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the ratio of butter to sugar.\n>1:4\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the ratio of flour to sugar.\n>6:4\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the amount of sugar by the ratio of butter to sugar to get the amount of butter.\n>8 cups of sugar * 1/4 = 2 cups of butter\n\n**Step 4:** Multiply the amount of sugar by the ratio of flour to sugar to get the amount of flour.\n>8 cups of sugar * 6/4 = 12 cups of flour\n\n**Step 5:** Add the amounts of butter, flour, and sugar to get the total amount of ingredients.\n>2 cups of butter + 12 cups of flour + 8 cups of sugar = 22 cups of ingredients\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{22}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have that in every recipe, there is 1 part butter to 6 parts flour to 4 parts sugar. That is identical to saying that there are $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ parts butter to $2 \\cdot 6 = 12$ parts flour to $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ parts sugar. If each part is a cup, then there must be 12 cups flour and 2 cups butter used. In total, there are $12+2+8=\\boxed{22}$ total cups of ingredients used."
