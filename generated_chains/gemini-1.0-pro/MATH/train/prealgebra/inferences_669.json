        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty switches in an office computer network are to be connected so that each switch has a direct connection to exactly three other switches. How many connections will be necessary?",
        "inference": "The problem states that each switch must be connected to exactly 3 other switches. Since each connection involves 2 switches, each switch accounts for 3/2 connections. Therefore, the total number of connections needed is:\n\nNumber of switches * Connections per switch\n\n= 20 * 3/2\n\n= 10 * 3\n\n= 30\n**Final Answer: 30**. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each switch has three connections. So, with twenty switches, there would seem to be $20 \\cdot 3 = 60$ connections. However, each connection corresponds to two switches. Thus, there are $\\frac{20\\cdot 3}{2} = \\boxed{30}$ connections."
