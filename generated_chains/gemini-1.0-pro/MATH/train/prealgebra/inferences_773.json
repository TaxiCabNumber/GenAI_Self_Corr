At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many four-character license plates consist of a consonant, followed by a vowel, followed by a consonant, and then a digit? (For this problem, consider Y a vowel.)",
        "inference": "There are 21 consonants and 5 vowels.\n\nThe first character can be chosen in 21 ways.\nThe second character can be chosen in 5 ways.\nThe third character can be chosen in 21 ways.\nThe fourth character can be chosen in 10 ways (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\nTherefore, the total number of four-character license plates that consist of a consonant, followed by a vowel, followed by a consonant, and then a digit is 21 x 5 x 21 x 10 = 22050.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{22050}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four total characters on the license plate. Each character has no relation to another, therefore, each character is considered an independent event. To count the total number of possibilities of a problem with independent events, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each event.\n\nThere are a total of 26 letters in the alphabet.  Of these, 6 (A, E, I, O, U, and Y) are vowels and the other 20 are consonants. There are a total of 10 digits, 0 through 9.\n\nThe number of plates then is:  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{\\# of consonants} &\\times \\text{\\# of vowels} \\times \\text{\\# of consonants} \\times \\text{\\# of digits} \\\\\n&=20 \\times 6 \\times 20 \\times 10\\\\\n& = \\boxed{24{,}000}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThere are a total of 24,000 different license plate combinations."
