At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo complementary angles are in a ratio of $3:2$. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smaller angle?",
        "inference": "Let the smaller angle be $3x$. Then the larger angle is $2x$. Since the angles are complementary, we have:\n$$3x + 2x = 90^\\circ$$\n$$5x = 90^\\circ$$\n$$x = 18^\\circ$$\nTherefore, the smaller angle is $3x = \\boxed{54^\\circ}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of the larger angle be $3x$.  Then the measure of the smaller angle is $2x$, and because the angles are complementary we have $3x+2x=90^\\circ$.  It follows that $x=90^\\circ/5=18^\\circ$, so the measure of the smaller angle is $2x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
