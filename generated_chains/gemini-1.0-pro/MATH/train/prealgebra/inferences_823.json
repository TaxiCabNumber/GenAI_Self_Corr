At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many interior diagonals does an icosahedron have?  (An $\\emph{icosahedron}$ is a 3-dimensional figure with 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices, with 5 faces meeting at each vertex.  An $\\emph{interior}$ diagonal is a segment connecting two vertices which do not lie on a common face.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nAn interior diagonal is a segment connecting vertices which do not lie on a common face.  Since each vertex is on exactly 5 faces, any diagonal has exactly 2 vertices that are not on a common face.  Thus, the number of interior diagonals is equal to the number of ways to choose 2 of the 12 vertices.  This can be computed using combinations: $$\\binom{12}{2} = \\frac{12!}{2!10!} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2} = \\boxed{66}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 vertices in the icosahedron, so from each vertex there are potentially 11 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 5 of these 11 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $12 \\times 6 = 72$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\\dfrac{12 \\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{36}$ diagonals."
