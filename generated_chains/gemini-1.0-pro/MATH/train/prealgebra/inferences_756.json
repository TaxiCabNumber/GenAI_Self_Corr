At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fair 6-sided die is rolled.  What is the probability that the number rolled is a divisor of 6?",
        "inference": "1. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n2. The number of outcomes in the sample space is 6 since a fair 6-sided die is rolled.\n3. The number of outcomes that are divisors of 6 is 3 since 1, 2, and 3 are the divisors of 6.\n4. Therefore the probability that the number rolled is a divisor of 6 is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{2}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 divisors of 6, namely $1,2,3,6$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac46=\\boxed{\\dfrac23}$."
