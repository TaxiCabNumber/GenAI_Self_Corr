At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo make pizza dough, Luca mixes 50 mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour. How many mL of milk does he mix with 750 mL of flour?",
        "inference": "- Luca mixes 50 mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour.\n- Therefore, he uses \\(\\frac{50}{250}=\\frac{1}{5}\\) mL of milk for every mL of flour.\n- To find the amount of milk needed for 750 mL of flour, we multiply 750 mL by the ratio \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\n$$750\\text{ mL}\\times\\frac{1}{5}\\text{ mL of milk per mL of flour}=150\\text{ mL of milk}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$150$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We divide the 750 mL of flour into portions of 250 mL.  We do this by calculating $750 \\div 250 = 3$. Therefore, 750 mL is three portions of 250 mL.\n\nSince 50 mL of milk is required for each 250 mL of flour, then $3\\times 50 = \\boxed{150}$ mL of milk is required in total."
