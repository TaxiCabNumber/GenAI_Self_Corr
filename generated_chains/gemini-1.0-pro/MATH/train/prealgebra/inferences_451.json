        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves 30 degrees per hour and 0.5 degrees per minute.\n\nAt 2:30 p.m., the hour hand has moved 2 hours and 30 minutes, so it has moved 2 * 30 + 0.5 * 30 = 90 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute.\n\nAt 2:30 p.m., the minute hand has moved 30 minutes, so it has moved 6 * 30 = 180 degrees.\n\nThe smaller angle between the two hands is the difference between their angles: 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{90}.

At 2:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 2 and the 3.
