At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe vertical drop of a roller coaster is the largest difference in height between any high point and the next low point. The vertical drops of five roller coasters at Mandelbrot Amusement Park are shown in the table. \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \\hline\nThe Parabola & 165 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe G Force & 119 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Mean Streak & 138 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Tower of Power & 300 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Maximum Ride & 198 feet \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular} What is the positive difference between the mean and the median of these values?",
        "inference": "1. **Mean** is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in a dataset. In this case, the mean can be calculated as\n(165 + 119 + 138 + 300 + 198) / 5 = 920 / 5 = 184.\n2. **Median** is the middle value of a dataset when assorted in the order from smallest to largest. In this case, the values can be assorted as\n{119, 138, 165, 198, 300}. The middle value is 165, which is the median.\n3. Now, we can find the **the positive difference between the mean and the median** as\n|mean - median| = |184 - 165| = 19.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$19$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we must find the mean and median of the values. In order to find the mean, we sum all the values and divide the result by the number of values: \\begin{align*} \\frac{165+119+138+300+198}{5} &= 184. \\end{align*} in order to find the median, we must first list the values in order from least to greatest: \\[ 119, 138, 165, 198, 300. \\] There are $5$ values, so the median is the middle value, which here is $165.$\n\nSo, the positive difference between the mean and the median is $184-165=\\boxed{19}.$"
