        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn 8.5-meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall. How many meters is its base from the wall if the ladder reaches 7.5 meters up the wall?",
        "inference": "We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the ladder is the hypotenuse, and the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall is one of the other sides. The other side is the height of the ladder that reaches up the wall. So, we can write:\n\n```\n8.5^2 = x^2 + 7.5^2\n```\n\nwhere x is the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall. Solving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx^2 = 8.5^2 - 7.5^2\nx^2 = 72.25 - 56.25\nx^2 = 16\nx = \u221a16\nx = 4\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have a right triangle where the ratio of one leg to the hypotenuse is $15:17$. Since 8, 15, 17 is a Pythagorean triple, the ratio of the other leg to the hypotenuse must be $8:17$. If the length of this leg is $x$, this means that $x/8.5 = 8/17$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{4}$ meters."
