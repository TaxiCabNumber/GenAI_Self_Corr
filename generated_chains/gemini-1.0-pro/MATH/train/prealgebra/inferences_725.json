At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn order for Mateen to walk a kilometer(1000m) in his rectangular backyard, he must walk the length 25 times or walk its perimeter 10 times. What is the area of Mateen's backyard in square meters?",
        "inference": "Let x and y be the length and the width of the backyard, respectively.\n\nThen,\n\n25x = 1000 m\n=> x = 1000/25 = 40 m\nand\n2(x + y) = 10(1000/10) = 1000 m\n=> x + y = 1000/2 = 500 m\n\nTherefore, the area of the backyard is \nA = xy = 40 * (500 - 40) = 40 * 460 = $18400 m^{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18400$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter is $1000\\div 10=100$, and this is two lengths and two widths. The length of the backyard is $1000\\div 25=40$. Since two lengths total 80, the two widths total 20, and the width is 10. The area is $10\\times 40=\\boxed{400}$."
