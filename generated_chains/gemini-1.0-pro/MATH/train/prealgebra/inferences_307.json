What percent increase in area results if Chantel's pizza increases from a 10-inch pizza to a 12-inch pizza?",
        "inference": "**Step 1; Find the area of the 10-inch pizza.**  The area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2.  For the 10-inch pizza, r = 5 inches.  So,  A = \u03c0(5)\u00b2 = 25\u03c0 square inches.\n**Step 2; Find the area of the 12-inch pizza.**   For the 12-inch pizza, r = 6 inches.  So,   A = \u03c0(6)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0 square inches.\n**Step 3; Find the percent increase in area.**  The percent increase is given by the formula:  Percent increase = (New area - Old area) / Old area \u00d7 100%  Substituting the values we found in steps 1 and 2, we get:  Percent increase = (36\u03c0 - 25\u03c0) / 25\u03c0 \u00d7 100%  Simplifying, we get:  Percent increase = 11\u03c0/25\u03c0 \u00d7 100%  = 0.44 \u00d7 100%  **= 44%**\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{44%}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the 10-inch pizza is $5^2\\pi = 25\\pi$ square inches, while the area of the 12-inch pizza is $6^2\\pi = 36\\pi$ square inches.  The increase is $36\\pi-25\\pi=11\\pi$. As a factor, this is an increase of $\\frac{11\\pi}{25\\pi} = \\frac{44}{100} = \\boxed{44\\%}$."
