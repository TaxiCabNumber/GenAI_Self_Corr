At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrea notices that the 40-foot tree next to her is casting a 10-foot shadow. How tall, in inches, is Andrea if she is casting a 15-inch shadow at the same time?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the ratio of the tree's height to the length of its shadow.\n- 40 feet / 10 feet = 4:1\n\n**Step 2**: Apply the same ratio to Andrea's height and shadow length.\n- Height : Shadow = 4 : 1\n- Andrea's height = 15 inches * 4 = 60 inches\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$60$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\\text{ feet})/(10\\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\\times 15\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{60}$ inches tall."
