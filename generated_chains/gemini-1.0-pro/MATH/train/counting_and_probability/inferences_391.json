At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cards are dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card dealt is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card dealt is a $\\spadesuit$?",
        "inference": "**The probability of drawing a diamond on the first draw is $\\frac{13}{52}$.**\n\n**The probability of drawing a spade on the second draw is $\\frac{13}{51}$.**\n\n**Therefore, the probability of drawing a diamond and then a spade is $\\frac{13}{52} \\cdot \\frac{13}{51} = \\frac{1}{162}$.**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{162}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Once a $\\diamondsuit$ is dealt, there are only 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of the second card being a $\\spadesuit$ is $\\frac{13}{51}$, not $\\frac14.$ Therefore, the probability of both cards being the required suits is $\\frac14 \\times \\frac{13}{51} =\\boxed{ \\frac{13}{204}}.$"
