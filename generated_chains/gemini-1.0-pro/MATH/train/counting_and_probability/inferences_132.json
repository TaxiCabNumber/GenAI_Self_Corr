        "inference": "**Step 1:** The probability of an event happening is given by the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n**Step 2:** Let's assume that the total number of possible outcomes is 7 (since the probability of Kim having a math test is 4/7).\n**Step 3:** The number of favourable outcomes for Kim not having a math test is 7 - 4 = 3.\n**Step 4:** Therefore, the probability of Kim not having a math test is 3/7.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}.

        "ground_truth": "The probability that Kim does not have a math test is equal to one minus the probability she does have a math test. So, the probability of not having a math test is $1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{7}}$."
