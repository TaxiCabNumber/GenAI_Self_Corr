At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree fair, standard six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is 18? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 = 216$ possible outcomes for the three dice.\nThe sum of the numbers on the top faces is 18 in the following cases:\n(6, 6, 6)\n(5, 6, 7)\n(6, 5, 7)\n(6, 7, 5)\n(7, 5, 6)\n(7, 6, 5)\nSo there are 6 such outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum of 18 is\n$$\\frac{6}{216} = \\frac{1}{36}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We quickly note that the only way for three dice to sum to 18 is for the face of each to be a 6. So, if each die is a 6, then the probability of this occurring is $\\frac{1}{6^3} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{216}}$."
