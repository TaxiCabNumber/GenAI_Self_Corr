At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ice cream shop offers 6 kinds of ice cream. What is the greatest number of two scoop sundaes that can be made such that each sundae contains two types of ice cream and no two sundaes are the same combination?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the number of possible combinations of two scoops from 6 types.**\nWe can use the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)\nwhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.\nIn this case, n = 6 and r = 2:\nC(6, 2) = 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!) = 6! / (2! * 4!) = 6 * 5 / 2 = 15\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of sundaes that can be made.**\nSince two sundaes are the same combination, we have:\nNumber of sundaes = Number of combinations / 2\nNumber of sundaes = 15 / 2 = 7.5\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.**",
