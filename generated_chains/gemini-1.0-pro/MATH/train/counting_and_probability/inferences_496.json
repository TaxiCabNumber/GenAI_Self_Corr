At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn integer greater than 9 and less than 100 is randomly chosen. What is the probability that its digits are different?",
        "inference": "Since the integer is greater than 9 and less than 100, it must be a two-digit number.\n\nThe first digit can be any number from 1 to 9, except 0.\nThe second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, except the first digit.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the first digit is 9.\nThe number of ways to choose the second digit is 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible two-digit numbers is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of two-digit numbers with different digits.\n\nThe first digit can be any number from 1 to 9, except 0.\nThe second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, except the first digit.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the first digit is 9.\nThe number of ways to choose the second digit is 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of two-digit numbers with different digits is 9 * 8 = 72.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen two-digit number has different digits is 72 / 81 = 8/9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8/9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We calculate the probability that the digits are the same, and subtract from 1. From the 90 integers to be chosen from, only 9 have the same digits: 11, 22, 33, ..., 99. Therefore, the probability that the digits are the same is $\\frac{9}{90} = \\frac{1}{10}$, so the probability that the digits are different is $1-\\frac{1}{10}= \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$."
