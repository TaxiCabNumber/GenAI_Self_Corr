        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe science club has 25 members: 10 boys and 15 girls.  A 5-person committee is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl?",
        "inference": "The probability of selecting a committee with at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl is the complement of the probability of selecting a committee with no boys and no girls.\nThe probability of selecting a committee with no boys and no girls is \n$$\\frac{\\binom{15}{5}}{\\binom{25}{5}}=\\frac{15\\times14\\times13\\times12\\times11}{25\\times24\\times23\\times22\\times21}=\\frac{3,603,600}{3,583,180}=\\frac{20}{19}$$\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a committee with at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl is \n$$1-\\frac{20}{19}=\\frac{19}{19}-\\frac{20}{19}=\\frac{19-20}{19}=\\frac{-1}{19}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{-1}{19}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can use the idea of complementary probability to solve this problem without too much nasty casework. The probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and 1 girl is equal to 1 minus the probability that the committee is either all boys or all girls. The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys is $\\binom{10}{5}=252$, the number of ways to choose a committee of all girls is $\\binom{15}{5}=3,\\!003$, and the total number of committees is $\\binom{25}{5}=53,\\!130$, so the probability of selecting a committee of all boys or all girls is $\\dfrac{252+3003}{53,\\!130}=\\dfrac{31}{506}$. Thus the probability that the committee contains at least one boy and one girl is $1-\\dfrac{31}{506} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{475}{506}}$."
