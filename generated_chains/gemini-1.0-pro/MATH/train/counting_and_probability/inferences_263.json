At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits?",
        "inference": "The number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is equal to the number of three-digit whole numbers minus the number of three-digit whole numbers with neither 7 nor 9 as digits.\n\nThe number of three-digit whole numbers with neither 7 nor 9 as digits is equal to the number of three-digit whole numbers with digits chosen from the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8} which is 8^3.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits is 10^3 - 8^3 = 1000 - 512 = 488.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{488}.

        "ground_truth": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$."
