At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cubes with the faces numbered 1 through 6 are tossed and the numbers shown on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": " **Solution:**\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes for each cube, so there are 36 possible outcomes in total.\n\nThe sum of the numbers on the top faces is even if both numbers are even or if both numbers are odd.\n\nThere are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5), so there are 9 ways to get an even sum.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting an even sum is \\frac{9}{36} = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "After the first cube has been rolled, the other cube has six possible results. Three are one parity, and three are the other parity, so no matter what the first cube shows, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac12}$ chance that the sum is either parity. Note that this is true no matter how many such cubes are rolled."
