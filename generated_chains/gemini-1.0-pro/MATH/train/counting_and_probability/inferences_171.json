I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that both cards are numbers (2 through 10) totaling to 12?",
        "inference": "The first card can be any one of the 36 number cards (2 through 10) in the deck.  Once the first card is chosen, there are 35 number cards remaining in the deck.  To total 12, the second card must be one of the 4 cards that, when added to the first card, total 12.  For example, if the first card is a 4, then the second card must be an 8.  There are 4 such possibilities: (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 6), and (7, 5).
