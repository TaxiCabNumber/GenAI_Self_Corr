At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree friends have a total of 6 identical pencils, and each one has at least one pencil. In how many ways can this happen?",
        "inference": "The three friends have 6 identical pencils to distribute among themselves. Let's represent this using stars and bars notation:\n\n```\n*** | *** | ***\n```\n\nThis shows that the first friend can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 pencils. Similarly, the second friend can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 pencils. And the third friend can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 pencils.\n\nSince the pencils are identical, we can group together all the distributions that are equivalent up to permutation. For example, the distributions (1, 2, 3) and (3, 2, 1) are equivalent up to permutation.\n\nTo count the number of ways this can happen, we can use the stars and bars formula:\n\n```\n(n + r - 1)! / (n - 1)! / r!\n```\n\nwhere n is the number of objects (pencils) and r is the number of groups (friends).\n\nPlugging in n = 6 and r = 3, we get:\n\n```\n(6 + 3 - 1)! / (6 - 1)! / 3! = 28\n```\n\nSo there are 28 ways for the three friends to have a total of 6 identical pencils, each one having at least one pencil.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$28$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest number of pencils that any friend can have is four. There are 3 ways that this can happen: $(4,1,1)$, $(1,4,1)$ and $(1,1,4)$. There are 6 ways one person can have 3 pencils: $(3,2,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(1,2,3)$ and $(1,3,2)$. There is only one way all three can have two pencils each: $(2,2,2)$. The total number of possibilities is $3+6+1=\\boxed{10}$."
