At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA deck of forty cards consists of four $1$'s, four $2$'s,..., and four $10$'s. A matching pair (two cards with the same number) is removed from the deck. Given that these cards are not returned to the deck, let $m/n$ be the probability that two randomly selected cards also form a pair, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$\n",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThere are $40 \\cdot 39$ ways to select the first and second cards from the deck.  There are $36 \\cdot 35$ to select the third and fourth cards from the remaining $38$ cards, and this third and fourth card forms a matching pair in $12$ ways.  Therefore, the probability that two randomly selected cards also form a pair is $\\frac{12}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{1}{130}$.  Thus, $m = 1$ and $n = 130$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{131}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are ${38 \\choose 2} = 703$ ways we can draw two cards from the reduced deck. The two cards will form a pair if both are one of the nine numbers that were not removed, which can happen in $9{4 \\choose 2} = 54$ ways, or if the two cards are the remaining two cards of the number that was removed, which can happen in $1$ way. Thus, the answer is $\\frac{54+1}{703} = \\frac{55}{703}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{758}$."
