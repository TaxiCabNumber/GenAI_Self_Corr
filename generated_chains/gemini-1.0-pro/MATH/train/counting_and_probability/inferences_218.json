At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and 8 are randomly arranged into a six-digit positive integer, what is the probability that the integer is divisible by 15? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The integer is divisible by 15 if and only if it is divisible by 3 and 5.\nThe integer is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\nThe sum of the digits is $1+2+3+5+5+8=24$, which is divisible by 3.\nThe integer is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 5 or 0.\nThe integer has two 5's as its last digits, so it is divisible by 5.\nTherefore, the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, and hence by 15.\nThere are $6!=720$ ways to arrange the six digits into a six-digit integer.\nOf these, there are $\\frac{6!}{2!1!}=360$ ways to arrange the two 5's as the last two digits.\nTherefore, the probability that the integer is divisible by 15 is $\\frac{360}{720}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.

        "ground_truth": "By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3. To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
