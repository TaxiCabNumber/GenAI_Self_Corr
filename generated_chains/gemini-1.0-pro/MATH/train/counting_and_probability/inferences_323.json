At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn draws a regular five pointed star in the sand, and at each of the 5 outward-pointing points and 5 inward-pointing points he places one of ten different sea shells. How many ways can he place the shells, if reflections and rotations of an arrangement are considered equivalent?",
        "inference": "First, there are 10 ways to place a shell on the first point, then 9 ways to place a shell on the second point, then 8 ways to place a shell on the third point, and so on. So, there are a total of $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 30,240$ ways to place the shells on the 5 outward-pointing points.\n\nNext, there are 10 ways to place a shell on the first inward-pointing point, then 9 ways to place a shell on the second inward-pointing point, then 8 ways to place a shell on the third inward-pointing point, and so on. So, there are a total of $10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 30,240$ ways to place the shells on the 5 inward-pointing points.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $30,240 \\times 30,240 = 912,672,000$ ways to place the shells on the star.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{912,672,000}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $10!$ ways to put the shells in the sand, not considering rotations and reflections. Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5, so they come in groups of ten equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $10!/10=\\boxed{362880}$ distinct arrangements."
