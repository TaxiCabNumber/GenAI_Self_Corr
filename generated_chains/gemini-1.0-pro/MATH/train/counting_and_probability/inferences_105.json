At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour standard, six-sided dice are to be rolled. If the product of their values turns out to be an even number, what is the probability their sum is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 6 possible outcomes for each die, so there are 6^4 = 1,296 possible outcomes for the 4 dice.\nThe product of the values of the 4 dice is even if and only if an even number of the values are even. There are 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers on a standard six-sided die, so there are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to get an even number of even values.\nThe sum of the values of the 4 dice is odd if and only if an odd number of the values are odd. There are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to get an odd number of odd values.\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the values of the 4 dice is even and the sum of their values is odd is:\n(6 choose 2) * (6 choose 3) / 6^4 = 60 / 1296 = 5 / 108\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5/108}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the product of their values is even, then at least one of the dice rolls must yield an even number. To find how many ways this is possible, we consider the complementary possibility: suppose that all of the dice rolls yield odd numbers. There are $3^4$ ways of this occurring, out of a total of $6^4$ possibilities. It follows that there are $6^4 - 3^4$ ways of obtaining at least one even value.\n\nNow, we need to count how many ways we can obtain an odd sum. There must then be an odd number of odd numbers rolled, so there must be either one or three odd numbers rolled. If one odd number is rolled, then there are $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the odd number, and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding a total of $4 \\cdot 3^4$ possibilities. If three odd numbers are rolled, then there are again $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the even number and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding $4 \\cdot 3^4$. Thus, the desired probability is given by $\\frac{4 \\cdot 3^4 + 4\\cdot 3^4}{6^4 - 3^4} = \\frac{8}{2^4 - 1} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$."
