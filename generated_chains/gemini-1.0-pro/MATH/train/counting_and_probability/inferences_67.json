This can be done in $5!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 8 people is $\\binom{8}{3}5!=\\boxed{3024}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3024}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$"
