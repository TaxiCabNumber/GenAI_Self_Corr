        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nThere are 16 possible outcomes when four coins are flipped simultaneously.  We list them in the table below along with the total value of the heads that come up.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cc} \\text{Outcome} & \\text{Total heads}\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter & 4\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Dime & 3\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Quarter & 3\\\\ Dime, Quarter & 2\\\\ Penny, Dime, Quarter & 3\\\\ Penny, Nickel & 2\\\\ Penny, Quarter & 2\\\\ Dime & 1\\\\ Penny, Nickel & 2\\\\ Penny & 1\\\\ Nickel & 1\\\\ Quarter & 1\\\\ \\text{Tails on all coins} & 0 \\end{array}$$\n\nThe outcomes in which at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads are:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{cc} \\text{Outcome} & \\text{Total heads}\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter & 4\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Dime & 3\\\\ Penny, Nickel, Quarter & 3\\\\ Dime, Quarter & 2\\\\ Penny, Dime, Quarter & 3 \\end{array}$$\n\nSo, there are 5 favorable outcomes out of 16 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads is 5/16.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{16}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). If the quarter is heads, there are 8 possibilities, since each of the other three coins may come up heads or tails.  If the quarter is tails, then the nickel and dime must be heads, so there are 2 possibilities, since the penny can be heads or tails.  So there are $8+2 = 10$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{10}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}$."
