At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",

The third ball can be placed in any of the 3 boxes, except the one that the first and second balls are in. The fourth ball can be placed in the remaining box. Therefore, the number of ways to put 4 balls in 3 boxes is:\n $$3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 6$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
