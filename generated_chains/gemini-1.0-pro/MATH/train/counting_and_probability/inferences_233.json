The number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's is 900 / 10 = 90.\n5. The number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 9's is 900 / 10 = 90.\n6. The number of three-digit whole numbers that have no 7's and no 9's is 90 * 90 = 8100.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8100}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers."
