At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
        "inference": "There are 4! = 24 ways for the students to stand in a straight line.\n\nHowever, there are 2 ways for the two students who refuse to stand next to each other to stand: next to each other or not next to each other.\n\nIf they are next to each other, there are 3! = 6 ways for the other two students to stand.\n\nIf they are not next to each other, there are 2! = 2 ways for them to stand, and 3! = 6 ways for the other two students to stand.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 - 6 - 6 = 12 ways for the four students to stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways."
