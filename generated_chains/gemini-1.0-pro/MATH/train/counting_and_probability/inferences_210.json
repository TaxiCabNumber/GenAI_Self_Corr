At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 3003. How many positive four-digit integers are palindromes?",
        "inference": "There are 9000 four-digit integers. A four-digit palindrome is determined by the first two digits and the last two digits. There are 10 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, 10 choices for the third digit, and 10 choices for the fourth digit. Hence, there are $10\\times10\\times10\\times10=1000$ four-digit palindromes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Constructing palindromes requires that we choose the thousands digit (which defines the units digit) and the hundreds digit (which defines the tens digit). Since there are 9 choices for the thousands digit, and 10 choices for the hundreds digit, creating $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ palindromes."
