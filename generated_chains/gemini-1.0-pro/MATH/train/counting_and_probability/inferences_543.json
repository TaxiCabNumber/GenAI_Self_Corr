At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Assuming all politicians are distinguishable, in how many ways can they sit around a circular table without restrictions?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "The number of ways to seat the politicians around a circular table without restrictions is the same as the number of ways to seat n objects in a circle, which is (n-1)!. In this case, n = 10, so the number of ways to seat the politicians around a circular table without restrictions is (10-1)! = 9!.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{362880}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 10 people to place, so we can place them in $10!$ ways, but this counts each valid arrangement 10 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  So the number of ways to seat them is $\\dfrac{10!}{10} = 9! = \\boxed{362,\\!880}$."
