I hope it is correct.'\nA set of $n$ people participate in an online video basketball tournament. Each person may be a member of any number of $5$-player teams, but no two teams may have exactly the same $5$ members. The site statistics show a curious fact: The average, over all subsets of size $9$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $9$ people is equal to the reciprocal of the average, over all subsets of size $8$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $8$ people. How many values $n$, $9\\leq n\\leq 2017$, can be the number of participants?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 477 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 482 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 487 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 557 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 562$\n",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of complete teams we can form from $9$ people, and $y$ be the number of complete teams we can form from $8$ people. Then we have, \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{\\binom{n}{9}}&=\\frac{1}{\\frac{y}{\\binom{n}{8}}}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x\\binom{n}{8}&=y\\binom{n}{9}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(n-8)&=y(n-9)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(n-8)&=y(n-9)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad yn-9y&=xn-8x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad yn-xn&=8x-9y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (y-x)n&=8x+9y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (y-x)n&=17(x+y)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=17\n\\end{align*}\nSo, the only possible value of $n$ is $n=\\boxed{17}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$.
