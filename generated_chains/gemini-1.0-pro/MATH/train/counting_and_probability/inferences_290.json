At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different four-letter arrangements can be formed using the six letters $A, B, C, D, E$ and $F$, if the first letter must be $C$, one of the other letters must be $B$, and no letter can be used more than once in the arrangement?",
        "inference": "Since the first letter must be $C$, there are $5$ choices for the second letter. Since one of the remaining letters must be $B$, there are $4$ choices for the third letter. Since no letter can be used more than once, there is $1$ choice for the fourth letter.\n\nSo, the number of different four-letter arrangements is $5 \\times 4 \\times 1 = \\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",

We now have 4 ways to pick the letter for the first remaining spot and 3 ways to pick the letter for the last remaining spot. This is a total of $1\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot3=\\boxed{36}$ ways to arrange the letters."
