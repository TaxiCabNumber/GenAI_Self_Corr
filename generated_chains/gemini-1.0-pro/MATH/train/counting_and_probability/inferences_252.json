At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can we put 3 math books and 5 English books on a shelf if all the math books must stay together and all the English books must also stay together?  (The math books are all different and so are the English books.)",

The two groups of books can be arranged in \\(2!=2\\) ways, since only two positions on the shelf matter. Thus, there are \\(6\\times120\\times2=\\boxed{1440}\\) ways to arrange the books.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1440$}. I hope it is correct.",
