At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n2 diagonals of a regular heptagon (a 7-sided polygon) are chosen.  What is the probability that they intersect inside the heptagon?",
        "inference": "A heptagon has 7 sides.  So, it has $\\frac{7\\times 6}{2}=21$ diagonals.  If two diagonals are chosen, there are $21\\times 20=420$ ways to do so.\n\nSince there are 7 sides, there are 7 vertices.  A diagonal can only intersect another diagonal if both endpoints of the diagonal are both inside the heptagon or both outside the heptagon.\n\nIf both endpoints of the diagonal are both inside the heptagon, then the diagonal will intersect 6 other diagonals.  If both endpoints of the diagonal are both outside the heptagon, then the diagonal will intersect 4 other diagonals.\n\nSo, there are $7\\times 6=42$ ways to choose two diagonals that intersect inside the heptagon and $7\\times 4=28$ ways to choose two diagonals that intersect outside the heptagon.\n\nTherefore, the probability that two diagonals intersect inside the heptagon is $\\frac{42}{420}=\\frac{1}{10}$.\\\\\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of points in the heptagon, and all but 7 (the sides of the heptagon) are diagonals, which means there are 14 diagonals.  So there are $\\binom{14}{2} = 91$ pairs of diagonals.  Any four points on the heptagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals. (If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\\binom{7}{4} = 35$.  So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\\dfrac{35}{91} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}$."
