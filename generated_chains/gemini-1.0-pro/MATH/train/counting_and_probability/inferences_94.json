At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three digit numbers are there?",
        "inference": "Here is a breakdown of the steps on how to find the number of three digit numbers:\n\n1. The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9. So, there are 9 possibilities for the first digit.\n\n2. The second digit can be any number from 0 to 9. So, there are 10 possibilities for the second digit.\n\n3. The third digit can be any number from 0 to 9. So, there are 10 possibilities for the third digit.\n\n4. To find the total number of three digit numbers, we need to multiply the number of possibilities for each digit. So, the total number of three digit numbers is 9 x 10 x 10 = 900.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{900}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The three-digit numbers start with $100$ and end with $999$. There are $999-100+1=\\boxed{900}$ three-digit numbers."
