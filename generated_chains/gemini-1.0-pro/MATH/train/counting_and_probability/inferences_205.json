At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAllen and Bethany each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.  Each stays for 15 minutes, then leaves.  What is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** From the moment Allen arrives to the moment he leaves, there are 90 minutes.\n\n**Step 2:** The probability that Bethany arrives during Allen's first minute is $\\frac{1}{90}$.\n\n**Step 3:** If Bethany arrives during Allen's first minute, they overlap for 15 minutes. The probability that she stays for at least 15 minutes is $\\frac{15}{90}=\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n**Step 4:** Therefore, the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other is: $$\\frac{1}{90}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{540}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{540}}$.

For example, if Allen arrived at 1:30, Bethany could arrive at any time between 1:15 and 1:45 and see Allen at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This will be equal to $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{9}{16}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\\frac{9}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}$.  Since the area of the square is 1, this is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party."
