        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA collection of 8 cubes consists of one cube with edge-length $k$ for each integer $k, 1 \\le k \\le 8.$ A tower is to be built using all 8 cubes according to the rules:\nAny cube may be the bottom cube in the tower.\nThe cube immediately on top of a cube with edge-length $k$ must have edge-length at most $k+2.$\nLet $T$ be the number of different towers than can be constructed. What is the remainder when $T$ is divided by 1000?\n",
        "inference": "For the bottom cube of the tower, there are 8 choices.\nOnce the bottom cube is chosen, there are 5 choices for the second cube, 3 choices for the third cube, and 1 choice for the fourth cube.\nThus, there are $8 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 120$ possibilities for the bottom four cubes of the tower.\nFor the last four cubes, there are 4 choices for the fifth cube, 2 choices for the sixth cube, and 1 choice for the last two cubes.\nThus, there are $4 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 8$ possibilities for the last four cubes of the tower.\nTherefore, there are $120 \\times 8 = 960$ possibilities for the tower.\nThe remainder when 960 is divided by 1000 is 960.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{960}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We proceed recursively. Suppose we can build $T_m$ towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m$. How many towers can we build using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m, m + 1$? If we remove the block of size $m + 1$ from such a tower (keeping all other blocks in order), we get a valid tower using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, m$. Given a tower using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, m$ (with $m \\geq 2$), we can insert the block of size $m + 1$ in exactly 3 places: at the beginning, immediately following the block of size $m - 1$ or immediately following the block of size $m$. Thus, there are 3 times as many towers using blocks of size $1, 2, \\ldots, m, m + 1$ as there are towers using only $1, 2, \\ldots, m$. There are 2 towers which use blocks $1, 2$, so there are $2\\cdot 3^6 = 1458$ towers using blocks $1, 2, \\ldots, 8$, so the answer is $\\boxed{458}$."
