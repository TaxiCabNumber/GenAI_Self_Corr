At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 5 people be seated around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "The number of ways to seat 5 people around a round table is 4!.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe can first choose any person to sit at a particular seat. This can be done in 5 ways. Once we have chosen one person, we can then choose the next person to sit next to them in 4 ways. The next person can be seated in 3 ways, and so on. So, the total number of ways to seat 5 people around a round table is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 4!.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4!}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 5 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$."
