At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
        "inference": "First, count the number of triangles that can be constructed using only the vertices on one face. There are 4 vertices on each face, and we can choose 3 vertices out of 4 in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. Since there are 6 faces, the total number of triangles that can be constructed using only the vertices on one face is $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\nNext, count the number of triangles that can be constructed using vertices on adjacent faces. There are 4 pairs of adjacent faces, and for each pair, we can choose 3 vertices (one from each face) in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. Thus, the total number of triangles that can be constructed using vertices on adjacent faces is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\nFinally, count the number of triangles that can be constructed using vertices on opposite faces. There are 3 pairs of opposite faces, and for each pair, we can choose 3 vertices (one from each face) in $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. Thus, the total number of triangles that can be constructed using vertices on opposite faces is $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct triangles that can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube is $24 + 16 + 12 = \\boxed{52}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.**",
