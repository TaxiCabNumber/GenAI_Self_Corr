        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo fair 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability at least one of the dice shows a 1?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's denote the event that at least one of the dice shows a 1 as $A$. The probability of this event is the complement of the probability that neither of the dice shows a 1.\n\nThe probability that the first die shows a number other than 1 is $\\frac{5}{6}$. The probability that the second die shows a number other than 1 is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nThe probability that neither of the dice shows a 1 is therefore $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$.\n\nThe probability of at least one of the dice showing a 1 is therefore $1 - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{11}{36}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 ways in which the first roll is not 1, and 5 ways in which the second roll is not 1, so there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ ways in which neither die shows 1.  Therefore there are $36-25=11$ ways in which one or both dice show 1.  So the probability of this is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{36}}$."
