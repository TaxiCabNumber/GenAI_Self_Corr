At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a press conference before the All-Star Game, eight All-Stars will be taking questions. Three are Cubs, three are Red Sox, and two are Yankees. If teammates insist on sitting together, how many ways can the eight All-Stars be seated in a row?",
