At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
        "inference": "The probability that the top card is red is $\\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe probability that the second card is black is $\\frac{26}{51}$, since there are now 26 black cards and 51 cards left in the deck.\n\nThe probability that both events occur is the product of the individual probabilities:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{26}{51} = \\frac{13}{51} = 0.2549$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.2549$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$."
