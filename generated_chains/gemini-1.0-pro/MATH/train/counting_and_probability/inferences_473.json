At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many subsets of the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ contain the number 5?",
        "inference": "The number of subsets of a set with $n$ elements is $2^n$. The set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ has $5$ elements, so the number of subsets of this set is $2^5 = 32$.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the subsets that contain the number $5$. There are $2^4 = 16$ subsets of the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ that do not contain the number $5$. Therefore, the number of subsets of the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ that contain the number $5$ is $32 - 16 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Solution 1: For each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can either choose to include the number in the set, or choose to exclude it.  We therefore have 2 choices for each of these 4 numbers, which gives us a total of $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ different subsets we can form.\n\nSolution 2: We can have either 5 by itself, 5 with one other number from the four, 5 with two other numbers, 5 with three other numbers, or 5 with all four other numbers. The number of ways to form a subset with 5 by itself is $\\binom{4}{0}$. The number of ways to form a subset with 5 and one other number is $\\binom{4}{1}$. Similarly, the number of ways to form a subset with 5 and two other numbers is $\\binom{4}{2}$, with three other numbers is $\\binom{4}{3}$, and with all four other numbers is $\\binom{4}{4}$. Thus, our answer is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{16}$."
