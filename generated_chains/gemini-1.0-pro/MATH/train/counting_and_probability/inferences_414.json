At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, and let $N$ be the number of functions $f$ from set $A$ to set $A$ such that $f(f(x))$ is a constant function. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
        "inference": "Since $f(f(x))$ is a constant function, $f(f(x)) = f(f(y))$ for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$. Therefore, $f(f(x)) = f(f(1))$ for all $x$ in $A$. Thus, there are $7$ choices for $f(f(1))$. For each choice of $f(f(1))$, there are $7$ choices for $f(1)$. For each choice of $f(1)$, there are $7$ choices for $f(2)$. For each choice of $f(2)$, there are $7$ choices for $f(3)$. For each choice of $f(3)$, there are $7$ choices for $f(4)$. For each choice of $f(4)$, there are $7$ choices for $f(5)$. For each choice of $f(5)$, there are $7$ choices for $f(6)$. Therefore, $N = 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7 = 7^7$. Thus, the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$ is $7^7 \\equiv 823 \\pmod{1000}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{823}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Any such function can be constructed by distributing the elements of $A$ on three tiers.\nThe bottom tier contains the constant value, $c=f(f(x))$ for any $x$.

Then for a given $k$, there are $\\tbinom6k$ ways to choose the elements on the middle tier, and then $k^{6-k}$ ways to draw arrows down from elements on the top tier to elements on the middle tier.\nThus $N=7\\cdot\\sum_{k=1}^6\\tbinom6k\\cdot k^{6-k}=7399$, giving the answer $\\boxed{399}$."
