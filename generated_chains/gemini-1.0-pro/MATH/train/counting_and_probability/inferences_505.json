I hope it is correct.'\nA club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThere are $3$ choices for the school that hosts the meeting.  Once this choice is made, there are $5$ choices for the first representative from the host school and $4$ choices for the second representative.  There are also $5$ choices for the representative from each of the other two schools.  By the multiplication principle, the total number of possible arrangements is\n$$3\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot5=3000$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3000}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways."
