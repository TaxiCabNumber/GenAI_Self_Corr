At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
        "inference": "Total number of balls in the box = 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nNumber of ways in which 2 white balls can be drawn out of 5 white balls = 5C2 = 10.\n\nNumber of ways in which 2 balls can be drawn out of 11 balls = 11C2 = 55.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both the balls drawn are white = (Number of ways in which 2 white balls can be drawn out of 5 white balls) / (Number of ways in which 2 balls can be drawn out of 11 balls)\n= 10/55\n= 2/11\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{11}}$. I hope it is correct.",
