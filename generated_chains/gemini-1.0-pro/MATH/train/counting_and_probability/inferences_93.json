At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf I roll a fair, regular six-sided die four times, what is the probability that I will roll the number $1$ exactly three times?",
        "inference": "The probability of rolling a $1$ on a single roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe probability of rolling a $1$ three times in a row is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{216}$.\n\nThe probability of rolling a number other than $1$ on the fourth roll is $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a $1$ exactly three times in four rolls is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{216} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{5}{1296}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{1296}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each roll is independent of every other roll, so the probability of getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of not getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\\frac{5}{6}$. Since we are looking for a $1$ rolled three times and a number not $1$ rolled once, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$. Now, we have to consider the order of the rolls. The number that is not a $1$ could be rolled on the first, second, third, or fourth roll, so we multiply by four. Hence, the probability of rolling $1$ exactly three times is $4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$."
