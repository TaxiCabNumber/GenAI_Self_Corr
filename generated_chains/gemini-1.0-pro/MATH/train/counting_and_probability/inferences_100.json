At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different natural numbers are selected from the set $\\ \\allowbreak \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 6\\}$. What is the probability that the greatest common factor of these two numbers is one? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

These are:\n\n(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),\n(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6),\n(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),\n(4, 5), (4, 6),\n(5, 6).\n\nNext, we can determine which of these pairs have a greatest common factor of 1. These are:\n\n(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),\n(2, 3),\n(3, 5),\n(4, 5).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the greatest common factor of the two selected numbers is one is:\n\n$$\\frac{8}{15}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$.

And of these, only the subsets $\\{ 2, 4 \\}, \\{2, 6 \\}, \\{3, 6 \\}, \\{ 4, 6 \\}$ are not relatively prime. So the probability of the two-element subset's elements having greatest common factor one is $1 - \\frac{4}{15} =\\boxed{ \\frac{11}{15}}$."
