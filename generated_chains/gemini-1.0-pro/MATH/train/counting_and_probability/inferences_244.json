        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe call a number a mountain number if its middle digit is larger than any other digit.  For example, 284 is a mountain number.  How many 3-digit mountain numbers are there?",
        "inference": "1. There are ten 3-digit numbers: 100, 101, 102, ..., 109.  \n2. None of these are mountain numbers, as the middle digit is 0.  \n3. The next ten 3-digit numbers are 110, 111, 112, ..., 119.  \n4. Only 111 is a mountain number, as the middle digit 1 is larger than the other digits.  \n5. Repeating this process with the next ten 3-digit numbers, 120, 121, 122, ..., 129, we find that only 121 is a mountain number.  \n6. Continuing, we find that only 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, and 191 are mountain numbers.  \n7. In general, the only 3-digit mountain number with a first digit of d is d1d (i.e., d with a 1 in the middle).  \n8. Since there are nine possible first digits (1, 2, 3, ..., 9), there are nine 3-digit mountain numbers.  \n**Final Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We will break this into three cases.\n\nCase 1: numbers of the form $xyx$ ($x \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding palindrome ($xyx$) mountain number, so the number of these is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$.\n\nCase 2: numbers of the form $xyz$ ($z \\ne 0, x \\ne z$).\n\nAny group of three nonzero digits ($y > x > z > 0$) has two corresponding mountain numbers ($xyz$ and $zyx$), so the number of these is $2 \\times \\binom{9}{3} = 168$.\n\nCase 3: numbers of the form $xy0$ ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$, so there are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ of these.\n\nSo the total number of mountain numbers is $36 + 168 + 36 = \\boxed{240}$."
