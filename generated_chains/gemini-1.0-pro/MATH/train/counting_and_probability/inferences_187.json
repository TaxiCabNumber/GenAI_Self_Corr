At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 consonants (B, D).  The number of ways to choose 4 letters from 5 letters is $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$.  The number of ways to choose 0 vowels from 3 vowels is $\\binom{3}{0} = 1$.  The number of ways to choose 4 consonants from 2 consonants is $\\binom{2}{4} = 0$.  The number of ways to choose 1 vowel from 3 vowels is $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$.  The number of ways to choose 3 consonants from 2 consonants is $\\binom{2}{3} = 0$.  The number of ways to choose 2 vowels from 3 vowels is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.  The number of ways to choose 2 consonants from 2 consonants is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$.  The number of ways to choose 3 vowels from 3 vowels is $\\binom{3}{3} = 1$.  The number of ways to choose 1 consonant from 2 consonants is $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$.  The number of ways to choose 4 letters with at least one vowel is $5\\cdot1\\cdot0 + 5\\cdot3\\cdot0 + 5\\cdot3\\cdot1 + 5\\cdot1\\cdot2 + 5\\cdot1\\cdot1 = 40$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$."
