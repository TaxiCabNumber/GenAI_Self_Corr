There are 4! ways to divide the cousins into four groups.\n4. Each group can be assigned to a room in any order.\n5.

There are $3$ ways to choose which of the other cousins will also stay in that room, and then the other two are automatically in the other room.\n\n(2,1,1,0): There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which cousins stay the same room.\n\n(1,1,1,1): There is one way for all the cousins to each stay in a different room.\n\nThe total number of possible arrangements is $1+4+3+6+1=\\boxed{15}$."
