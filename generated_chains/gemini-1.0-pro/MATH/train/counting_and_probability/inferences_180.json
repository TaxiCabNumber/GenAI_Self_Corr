        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAfter a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let x be the number of gymnasts on each team.\n\n**Step 2:** The number of handshakes among the gymnasts on each team is x * (x - 1) / 2.\n\n**Step 3:** The number of handshakes between the gymnasts and the coach is x.\n\n**Step 4:** The total number of handshakes is thus x * (x - 1) / 2 + x.\n\n**Step 5:** Since there were 281 handshakes in total, we have the equation:\nx * (x - 1) / 2 + x = 281\n\n**Step 6:** Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\nx * (x - 1) + 2x = 562\n\n**Step 7:** Expanding and simplifying, we get:\nx^2 + x - 562 = 0\n\n**Step 8:** Factoring, we get:\n(x + 23)(x - 24) = 0\n\n**Step 9:** Therefore, the possible values of x are -23 and 24. Since the number of gymnasts cannot be negative, we have x = 24.\n\n**Step 10:** The fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is x, which is 24.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$."
