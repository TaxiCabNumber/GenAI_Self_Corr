All numbers between $4095$ and $4995$ are possible values of S, so the number of possible values of S is $4995-4095+1=901$.\nAlternatively, for ease of calculation, let set $\\mathcal{B}$ be a 10-element subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$, and let $T$ be the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{B}$.

The smallest possible $T$ is $1+2+ \\ldots +10 = 55$ and the largest is $91+92+ \\ldots + 100 = 955$, so the number of possible values of T, and therefore S, is $955-55+1=\\boxed{901}$."
