At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI want to choose a license plate which is 3 characters long, where the first character is a letter, the last character is a digit, and the middle is either a letter or a digit. I also want there to be two characters on my license plate which are the same. How many ways are there for me to choose a license plate with these restrictions?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** There are 26 letters that can be chosen for the first character.\n\n**Step 2:** There are 10 digits that can be chosen for the last character.\n\n**Step 3:** There are 36 possibilities for the middle character (26 letters and 10 digits).\n\n**Step 4:** Since two characters must be the same, there are 3 possibilities for which two characters are the same (first and middle, first and last, or middle and last).\n\n**Step 5:** Multiply the possibilities from steps 1-4 to get the total number of ways to choose a license plate: $26 \\times 10 \\times 36 \\times 3 = 27,360$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{27,360}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 26 ways to choose the first letter and 10 ways to choose the last digit. Then, since the middle digit must be the same as either the first letter or the last digit, there are 2 ways to choose the middle digit. Therefore, there are a total of $26\\cdot10\\cdot2=\\boxed{520}$ possible license plates I can choose."
