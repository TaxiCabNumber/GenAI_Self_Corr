At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe chart below gives the air distance in miles between selected world cities. If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles?
