        "inference": "**Step 1:** Any polynomial of degree at most $3$ can be written as $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3$, where $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are real numbers (in this case, they are elements of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$).\n\n**Step 2:** We are given that $P(-1) = -9$. Substituting $x = -1$ into the equation for $P(x)$, we get $P(-1) = a_0 + (-a_1) + a_2 + (-a_3) = -9$.\n\n**Step 3:** This tells us that $a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 = -9$.\n\n**Step 4:** We are given that the coefficients of $P(x)$ are elements of $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.\n\n**Step 5:** There are $10$ choices for $a_0$, $10$ choices for $a_1$, $10$ choices for $a_2$, and $10$ choices for $a_3$.\n\n**Step 6:** However, we have the restriction that $a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 = -9$.\n\n**Step 7:** This means that the choices for $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ are not independent.\n\n**Step 8:** Let's fix $a_0$ and $a_1$. Then the only choice for $a_2$ is $a_2 = a_0 - a_1 + 9$.\n\n**Step 9:** Since there are $10$ choices for $a_0$ and $10$ choices for $a_1$, there are $10^2 = 100$ possible pairs of $(a_0, a_1)$.\n\n**Step 10:** For each pair of $(a_0, a_1)$, there is a unique choice for $a_2$.\n\n**Step 11:** Once $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$ are determined, there is only one possible choice for $a_3$, namely $a_3 = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - 9$.\n\n**Step 12:** Therefore, there are $100$ choices for the coefficients of $P(x)$ such that $P(-1) = -9$.\n**Final Answer: $100$.
