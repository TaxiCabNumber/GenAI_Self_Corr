At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA jar contains two red marbles, three green marbles, ten white marbles and no other marbles. Two marbles are randomly drawn from this jar without replacement. What is the probability that these two marbles drawn will both be red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let's think step by step.\nThe probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw is $\\frac{2}{15}$.\nAfter the first draw, there will be 14 marbles left in the jar, of which 1 will be red.\nThe probability of drawing a red marble on the second draw is $\\frac{1}{14}$.\nTherefore, the probability of drawing two red marbles is $\\frac{2}{15} \\times \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{1}{105}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{105}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The total number of marbles is $2+3+10=15$.  The probability that the first marble drawn will be red is $2/15$.  Then, there will be one red left, out of 14.  Therefore, the probability of drawing out two red marbles will be: $$\\frac{2}{15}\\cdot\\frac{1}{14}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{105}}$$"
