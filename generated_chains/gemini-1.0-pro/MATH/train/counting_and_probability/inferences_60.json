At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Express your answer as a common fraction.",

For each black card, there is a $\\dfrac{25}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is also black, giving 1 pair, and a $\\dfrac{26}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is red, giving 0 pairs. There are 26 black cards, so the expected value of the number of pairs of adjacent black cards is $$26\\left(\\frac{25}{51}(1)+\\frac{26}{51}(0)\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{650}{51}}$$"
