        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the minimum number of times you must throw three fair six-sided dice to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice?",
        "inference": "Since the smallest possible sum of a three dice roll is 3 and the largest is 18, there are 16 possible outcomes.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, if we roll the dice at least 17 times, then at least one number will appear twice.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In the worst-case scenario, every possible sum is rolled before the same sum is rolled again. The minimum possible sum rolled is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, and the maximum is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$. Every sum in between those two extremes can be created, since the sums are created through adding three of the digits between one and six. Thus, there are $18 - 2 = 16$ possible sums, so the dice must be rolled $\\boxed{17}$ times to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice."
