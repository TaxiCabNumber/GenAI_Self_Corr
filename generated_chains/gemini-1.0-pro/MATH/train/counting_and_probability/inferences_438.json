        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA child has a set of 96 distinct blocks. Each block is one of 2 materials (plastic, wood), 3 sizes (small, medium, large), 4 colors (blue, green, red, yellow), and 4 shapes (circle, hexagon, square, triangle). How many blocks in the set differ from the 'plastic medium red circle' in exactly 2 ways? (The 'wood medium red square' is such a block)\n(A) 29 (B) 39 (C) 48 (D) 56 (E) 62\n",
        "inference": "There are 96 blocks in total. One block is the 'plastic medium red circle'. There are 2 * 3 * 4 * 4 = 96 ways to choose the material, size, color and shape of a block. So there are 96 - 1 = 95 blocks that differ from the 'plastic medium red circle' in at least one way.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of blocks that differ from the 'plastic medium red circle' in exactly 2 ways. To do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 out of 4 = 4C2 = 6\n\nNumber of ways to choose 1 out of 4 = 4C1 = 4\n\nNumber of blocks that differ from the 'plastic medium red circle' in exactly 2 ways = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nTherefore, the answer is 95 - 24 = \\boxed{71}.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{71}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The process of choosing a block can be represented by a generating function. Each choice we make can match the 'plastic medium red circle' in one of its qualities $(1)$ or differ from it in $k$ different ways $(kx)$. Choosing the material is represented by the factor $(1+1x)$, choosing the size by the factor $(1+2x)$, etc:\\[(1+x)(1+2x)(1+3x)^2\\]Expanding out the first two factors and the square:\\[(1+3x+2x^2)(1+6x+9x^2)\\]By expanding further we can find the coefficient of $x^2$, which represents the number of blocks differing from the original block in exactly two ways. We don't have to expand it completely, but choose the terms which will be multiplied together to result in a constant multiple of $x^2$:\\[1\\cdot9+3\\cdot6+2\\cdot1=\\boxed{29}\\]"
