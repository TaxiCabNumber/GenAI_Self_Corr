        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMelinda has three empty boxes and $12$ textbooks, three of which are mathematics textbooks. One box will hold any three of her textbooks, one will hold any four of her textbooks, and one will hold any five of her textbooks. If Melinda packs her textbooks into these boxes in random order, the probability that all three mathematics textbooks end up in the same box can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
        "inference": "We have $3$ boxes, one to hold $3$ books, one to hold $4$ books, and one to hold $5$ books, and we have $12$ books of which $3$ are math books.\n\nThere are $\\binom{12}{3}$ ways to choose $3$ books to be math books. Then, there are $3!$ ways to order these $3$ books. So, there are $\\binom{12}{3}3!=220$ ways to choose and order the $3$ math books.\n\nNow, we need to count the number of ways to put the $12$ books into the $3$ boxes. There are $3^{12}$ ways to do this.\n\nSo, the probability that all three mathematics textbooks end up in the same box is $\\frac{220}{3^{12}}=\\frac{55}{2187}$.\n\nTherefore, $m+n=55+2187=\\boxed{2242}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2242}.$ I hope it is correct.",

If all of the math textbooks are put into the box that can hold $3$ textbooks, there are $9!/(4!\\cdot 5!)=9\\textbf{C}4$ ways for the other textbooks to be arranged.

If all of the math textbooks are put into the box with the capability of holding $5$ textbooks, there are $9\\textbf{C}2$ ways to choose the other 2 textbooks in that box, times $7\\textbf{C}3$ ways to arrange the other 7 textbooks. $9\\textbf{C}4=9\\cdot7\\cdot2=126$, $9\\cdot 8\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot8\\cdot7=504$, and $9\\textbf{C}2\\cdot 7\\textbf{C}3=9\\cdot7\\cdot5\\cdot4=1260$, so the total number of ways the math textbooks can all be placed into the same box is $126+504+1260=1890$. So, the probability of this occurring is $\\frac{(9\\cdot7)(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot7\\cdot3}=\\frac{1890}{27720}$. If the numerator and denominator are both divided by $9\\cdot7$, we have $\\frac{(2+8+(4\\cdot5))}{4\\cdot11\\cdot10}=\\frac{30}{440}$. Simplifying the numerator yields $\\frac{30}{10\\cdot4\\cdot11}$, and dividing both numerator and denominator by $10$ results in $\\frac{3}{44}$. This fraction cannot be simplified any further, so $m=3$ and $n=44$. Therefore, $m+n=3+44=\\boxed{47}$."
