        "inference": "To find the value of the $40^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number, we need to determine the pattern and equation of the arrangement.\n\nLooking at the arrangement, we can observe that each row has an equal number of terms, and the number of terms increases by $2$ in each subsequent row. That is, Row 1 has $2$ terms, Row 2 has $4$ terms, Row 3 has $6$ terms, and Row 4 has $8$ terms.\n\nFurthermore, the value of each term in a row is the same. For example, in Row 1, both terms are $2$, in Row 2, all four terms are $4$, and so on.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can deduce that the general equation for the $n^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number in the arrangement is:\n\n$n^{th} \\text{ number} = n \\times 2$\n\nwhere $n$ is the row number, which starts from $1$.\n\nFor example, to find the $5^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number, we would substitute $n = 5$ into the equation:\n\n$5^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ number} = 5 \\times 2 = 10$\n\nSimilarly, to find the $40^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number, we substitute $n = 40$ into the equation:\n\n$40^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ number} = 40 \\times 2 = \\boxed{80}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$.
