At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain cross country meet between 2 teams of 5 runners each, a runner who finishes in the $n$th position contributes $n$ to his teams score. The team with the lower score wins. If there are no ties among the runners, how many different winning scores are possible?\n(A) 10 (B) 13 (C) 27 (D) 120 (E) 126\n",
        "inference": "The winning score can be any total from 6 to 25, with the exception of 16. This gives us 20 possible winning scores.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$20$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The scores of all ten runners must sum to $55$. So a winning score is anything between $1+2+3+4+5=15$ and $\\lfloor\\tfrac{55}{2}\\rfloor=27$ inclusive. It is easy to check that this range is covered by considering $1+2+3+4+x$, $1+2+3+x+10$ and $1+2+x+9+10$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
