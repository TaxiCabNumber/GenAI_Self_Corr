At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different $4\\times 4$ arrays whose entries are all 1's and -1's have the property that the sum of the entries in each row is 0 and the sum of the entries in each column is 0?\n",
        "inference": "The sum of the entries in each row and column is 0, so the sum of all the entries in the array is 0. This means there must be an even number of -1's in the array. Since there are 16 entries in the array, there must be 8 1's and 8 -1's. There are $\\binom{16}{8} = 12870$ ways to choose which entries are 1's and which are -1's. However, we must divide by 2 because the array is symmetric about the diagonal, so each array is counted twice. Thus, there are $\\frac{12870}{2} = \\boxed{6435}$ different $4\\times 4$ arrays whose entries are all 1's and -1's with the desired property.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6435}$. I hope it is correct.",

We do casework upon the first two columns:\nThe first two columns share no two numbers in the same row. There are ${4\\choose2} = 6$ ways to pick two 1's in the first column, and the second column is determined. For the third and fourth columns, no two numbers can be in the same row (to make the sum of each row 0), so again there are ${4\\choose 2}$ ways. This gives $6^2 = 36$.\nThe first two columns share one number in the same row. There are ${4\\choose 1} = 4$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1, then ${3\\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the locations for the next two 1s, and then $2$ ways to orient the 1s. For the third and fourth columns, the two rows with shared 1s or -1s are fixed, so the only things that can be changed is the orientation of the mixed rows, in $2$ ways. This gives $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 48$.\nThe first two columns share two numbers in the same row. There are ${4\\choose 2} = 6$ ways to pick the position of the shared 1s.
