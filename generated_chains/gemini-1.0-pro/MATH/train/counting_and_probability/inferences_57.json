At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDiane has one 1-cent stamp, two identical 2-cent stamps, and so on, up to nine identical 9-cent stamps. In how many different arrangements can Diane paste exactly 10 cents worth of postage in a row across the top of an envelope? (Note, however, that simply rotating or inverting a stamp, or exchanging the positions of two stamps with the same denomination should be considered the same arrangement.)",
        "inference": "To begin with, Diane must select one of her ten stamps to be the first one in the row. There is only one way to do this.\n\nOnce the first stamp is in place, Diane must determine how many cents she must obtain from the remaining stamps. This value can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n\nTo get 9 cents: Diane has only one choice: a single 9-cent stamp. (9)\n\nTo get 8 cents: Diane has two choices: (i) Two 4-cent stamps or (ii) a single 8-cent stamp. (18)\n\nTo get 7 cents: Diane has three choices: (i) Three 2-cent stamps and one 1-cent stamp; (ii) one 7-cent stamp; or (iii) one 9-cent stamp and one 2-cent stamp. (27)\n\nTo get 6 cents: Diane has four choices: (i) Six 1-cent stamps, (ii) three 2-cent stamps, (iii) two 3-cent stamps, or (iv) one 6-cent stamp. (36)\n\nTo get 5 cents: Diane has five choices: (i) Five 1-cent stamps, (ii) two 2-cent stamps and one 1-cent stamp, (iii) one 3-cent stamp and two 1-cent stamps, (iv) one 4-cent stamp and one 1-cent stamp, or (v) one 5-cent stamp. (45)\n\nTo get 4 cents: Diane has six choices: (i) Four 1-cent stamps, (ii) two 2-cent stamps, (iii) one 3-cent stamp and one 1-cent stamp, (iv) one 4-cent stamp, (v) one 8-cent stamp and one 4-cent stamp, or (vi) one 9-cent stamp and one 5-cent stamp. (54)\n\nTo get 3 cents: Diane has seven choices: (i) Three 1-cent stamps, (ii) one 2-cent stamp and one 1-cent stamp, (iii) one 3-cent stamp, (iv) one 6-cent stamp and one 3-cent stamp, (v) one 7-cent stamp and one 4-cent stamp, (vi) one 8-cent stamp and one 5-cent stamp, or (vii) one 9-cent stamp and one 6-cent stamp. (63)\n\nTo get 2 cents: Diane has eight choices: (i) Two 1-cent stamps, (ii) one 2-cent stamp, (iii) one 4-cent stamp and two 1-cent stamps, (iv) one 5-cent stamp and one 3-cent stamp, (v) one 6-cent stamp and one 4-cent stamp, (vi) one 7-cent stamp and one 5-cent stamp, (vii) one 8-cent stamp and one 6-cent stamp, or (viii) one 9-cent stamp and one 7-cent stamp. (72)\n\nTo get 1 cent: Diane has nine choices: (i) One 1-cent stamp, (ii) one 2-cent stamp and one 1-cent stamp, (iii) one 3-cent stamp and two 1-cent stamps, (iv) one 4-cent stamp and three 1-cent stamps, (v) one 5-cent stamp and four 1-cent stamps, (vi) one 6-cent stamp and five 1-cent stamps, (vii) one 7-cent stamp and six 1-cent stamps, (viii) one 8-cent stamp and seven 1-cent stamps, or (ix) one 9-cent stamp and eight 1-cent stamps. (81)\n\nHence the number of arrangements to paste exactly 10 cents worth of postage in a row across the top of an envelope is 9 + 18 + 27 + 36 + 45 + 54 + 63 + 72 + 81=405.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{405}.
