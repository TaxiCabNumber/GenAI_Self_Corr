At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRyan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, and then randomly turns 3 of them on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are $6!$ ways to arrange the lamps, and $3!$ ways to choose and turn on the 3 lamps.  Therefore, there are $6! \\cdot 3! = 4320$ possible arrangements of the lamps.\n\nThere are 3 blue lamps, and 3 ways to choose the leftmost lamp.  For each of these 3 ways, we have 3 ways to choose the rightmost lamp.  For each of these 9 ways, there are $3!$ ways to choose and turn on the remaining 3 lamps.  Therefore, there are $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3! = 54$ arrangements of the lamps that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThe probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on is $\\frac{54}{4320} = \\frac{3}{240} = \\frac{1}{80}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{80}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose where the red lamps go, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which lamps are on. If the left lamp is blue and off, and the right lamp is red and on, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are red, and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are on. Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{6\\cdot6}{20\\cdot20}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}$."
