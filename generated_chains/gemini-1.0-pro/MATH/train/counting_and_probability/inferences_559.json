At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour prime numbers are randomly selected without replacement from the first ten prime numbers. What is the probability that the sum of the four selected numbers is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $10$ prime numbers in the first ten natural numbers: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29$. There are $2^4 = 16$ possible combinations of four of these numbers. The sum of four numbers is odd if and only if at least one of the numbers is odd. There are $5$ odd prime numbers in the first ten natural numbers: $3, 5, 7, 11, 13$. So there are $5^4 = 625$ combinations of four numbers that include at least one odd number. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the four selected numbers is odd is $$ \\frac{625}{16} = \\boxed{\\frac{625}{16}}. $$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{625}{16}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first 10 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.  The sum of four of these numbers is only odd if 2, the only even number on the list, is among them because the sum of four odd numbers is even. Once 2 is picked, there are $\\binom{9}{3}=\\frac{9!}{3!6!}=84$ ways to pick three numbers from the remaining nine. The total number of ways to select four prime numbers from the ten is $\\binom{10}{4}=\\frac{10!}{4!6!}=210$. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the four selected numbers is odd is $\\frac{84}{210}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
