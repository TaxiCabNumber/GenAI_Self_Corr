At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn has 6 green marbles and 4 purple marbles. He chooses a marble at random, writes down its color, and then puts the marble back.  He performs this process 5 times. What is the probability that he chooses exactly two green marbles?",
        "inference": "The probability of choosing a green marble is 6/10 = 3/5. \nThe probability of choosing a purple marble is 4/10 = 2/5. \nThe probability of choosing exactly two green marbles is:\n(3/5) * (3/5) * (2/5) * (2/5) * (2/5) = 216/3125\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{216/3125}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which two of the five marbles John chose were green. For any of those 10 choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{6}{10} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{4}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{72}{3125}$ chance for that choice to happen. The total probability is then $10 \\cdot \\frac{72}{3125}= \\boxed{\\frac{144}{625}}$."
