At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach face of a cube is painted either  red or blue, each with probability 1/2. The color of each face is determined independently.  What is the probability that the painted cube can be placed on a horizontal surface so that the four vertical faces are all the same color?",
        "inference": "The four vertical faces of a cube are all the same color if and only if the top and bottom faces are the same color, or if the top face is one color and the bottom face is the other.\n\n**Case 1: Top and bottom faces same color.** \n\nThere are two possibilities: both red, or both blue. The probability of each of these possibilities is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n**Case 2: Top face one color and bottom face other color.** \n\nThere are two possibilities: top red and bottom blue, or top blue and bottom red. The probability of each of these possibilities is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\n**Total probability:**\n\nThe probability of either case occurring is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1/2$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the orientation of the cube is fixed, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible arrangements of colors on the faces. There are \\[\n2\\binom{6}{6}=2\n\\]arrangements in which all six faces are the same color and \\[\n2\\binom{6}{5}=12\n\\]arrangements in which exactly five faces have the same color. In each of these cases the cube can be placed so that the four vertical faces have the same color. The only other suitable arrangements have four faces of one color, with the other color on a pair of opposing faces. Since there are three pairs of opposing faces, there are $2(3)=6$ such arrangements. The total number of suitable arrangements is therefore $2+12+6=20$, and the probability is $20/64= \\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$."
