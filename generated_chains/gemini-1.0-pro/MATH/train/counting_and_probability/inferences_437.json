        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive people are sitting at a round table. Let $f\\geq 0$ be the number of people sitting next to at least 1 female and $m\\geq0$ be the number of people sitting next to at least one male. The number of possible ordered pairs $(f,m)$ is\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ 7 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ 8 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ 9 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ 10 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ 11 }$\n",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nSince the table is round, each person has two neighbors.  The five people can be divided into two groups:  those sitting next to at least one female and those sitting next to at least one male.  There are $f$ people in the first group and $m$ people in the second group.  Since the table is round, each person has two neighbors, so the total number of neighbors is $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$.  Thus,\n\n$$f+m=10.$$\n\nAlso, each person is counted in either $f$ or $m$ but not both, so the total number of people is $f+m = 5$.  Thus,\n\n$$f+m=5.$$\n\nSolving the system of equations $f+m=10$ and $f+m=5$, we get $f=5$ and $m=5$, so the number of possible ordered pairs $(f,m)$ is $\\boxed{1}$, or\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",

If there is one woman, the pair is $(2,5)$.\nIf there are two women, there are two arrangements: one in which they are together, and one in which they are apart, giving the pairs $(4,5)$ and $(3,5)$.\nAll four pairs are asymmetrical; therefore by symmetry there are $\\boxed{8}$ pairs altogether."
