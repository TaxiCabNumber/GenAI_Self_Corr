If a point is selected at random on $\\overline{AB}$, what is the probability that it is between $C$ and $D$?

        "inference": "Since $AB = 3AD$, $D$ divides $\\overline{AB}$ in the ratio 1:3. Since $AB = 6BC$, $C$ divides $\\overline{AB}$ in the ratio 1:6. So $\\overline{AB}$ is divided into 10 equal parts, and $CD$ is 4 of those parts. Thus, the probability that a point selected at random on $\\overline{AB}$ is between $C$ and $D$ is $\\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.",

Similarly, since $AB=6BC$, $\\overline{BC}$ must take up $1/6$ of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Then, $\\overline{CD}$ is the remaining segment of $\\overline{AB}$ and takes up $1-1/3 - 1/6 = 1/2$ of the total length of $\\overline{AB}$. Thus, if we were to choose a random point on segment $\\overline{AB}$, there would be a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that it is between points $C$ and $D$."
