At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarius is entering a wildlife photo contest, and wishes to arrange his seven snow leopards of different heights in a row. If the shortest two leopards have inferiority complexes and demand to be placed at the ends of the row, how many ways can he line up the leopards?",
        "inference": "Marius has seven leopards to arrange in a row, but the shortest two must be placed at the ends. This means that Marius has five leopards to arrange in the middle. There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange these five leopards. However, since the two shortest leopards are identical, the number of arrangements is actually 120 / 2 = 60. Therefore, the total number of ways that Marius can line up the leopards is 60.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are two ways to arrange the shortest two leopards. For the five remaining leopards, there are $5!$ ways to arrange them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $2\\times5!=\\boxed{240\\text{ ways.}}$"
