At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fair coin is flipped $7$ times. What is the probability that at least $5$ consecutive flips come up heads?",
        "inference": "The probability of getting heads on a single flip is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of getting tails on a single flip is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe probability of getting at least $5$ consecutive heads is equal to the probability of getting $5$ consecutive heads plus the probability of getting $6$ consecutive heads plus the probability of getting $7$ consecutive heads.\n\nThe probability of getting $5$ consecutive heads is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}$.\nThe probability of getting $6$ consecutive heads is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{64}$.\nThe probability of getting $7$ consecutive heads is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{1}{128}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least $5$ consecutive heads is $\\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} = \\frac{7}{128}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{128}}$.

There are three positions for a string of $5$ heads in a row, so there are $3$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: Exactly $6$ heads in a row. There are two positions for a string of $6$ heads in a row, so there are $2$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: Exactly $6$ heads, but not six in a row. There are two possibilities: either the first five coins and the last coin are heads, or the last five coins and the first coin are heads.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: $7$ heads.
