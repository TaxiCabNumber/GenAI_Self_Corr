At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEighty percent of adults drink coffee and seventy percent drink tea. What is the smallest possible percent of adults who drink both coffee and tea?",

Of the 20% who do not drink coffee, \\(x\\) percent also drink tea.  Of the 30% who do not drink tea, \\(x\\) percent also drink coffee.  Thus \\(x\\) is the minimum of 20% 20% and 30% 30%.  The smallest possible percent of adults who drink both coffee and tea is 20%.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Adding together the percent of people who drink coffee with those who drink tea, we obtain a total of $150\\%$.  Thus, we double-counted at least $50\\%$, meaning that at least $\\boxed{50\\%}$ of adults drink both.  (The percentage who drink both ${\\it can}$ be exactly ${50\\%}$ if everybody drinks either coffee or tea; otherwise, the overlap is more than ${50\\%}$, but the problem asked for the smallest possible overlap.)"
