        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit numbers are composed of three distinct digits such that one digit is the average of the other two?",
        "inference": "Let the three digits be $a$, $b$ and $c$ where $a<b<c$.\nTherefore, $b = \\frac{a+c}{2}$\nNow, $a, b$ and $c$ can take values from 1 to 9. So, there are 9 choices for $a$, 8 choices for $b$ and 7 choices for $c$.\nBut $a$ and $c$ are not fixed for a particular choice of $b$.\nSo, number of ways of selecting $a$ and $c$ for a particular choice of $b = 7 \\times 7 = 49$\nTherefore, total number of three-digit numbers = $ 9 \\times 8 \\times 49 = 3528$\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{3528}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The set of the three digits of such a number can be arranged to form an increasing arithmetic sequence.  There are 8 possible sequences with a common difference of 1, since the first term can be any of the digits 0 through 7.  There are 6 possible sequences with a common difference of 2, 4 with a common difference of 3, and 2 with a common difference of 4. Hence there are 20 possible arithmetic sequences. Each of the 4 sets that contain 0 can be arranged to form $2\\cdot2!=4$ different numbers, and the 16 sets that do not contain 0 can be arranged to form $3!=6$ different numbers.  Thus there are a total of $4\\cdot4+16\\cdot6=\\boxed{112}$ numbers with the required properties."
