At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA mail carrier delivers mail to the nineteen houses on the east side of Elm Street. The carrier notices that no two adjacent houses ever get mail on the same day, but that there are never more than two houses in a row that get no mail on the same day. How many different patterns of mail delivery are possible?\n",
        "inference": "Let us assume that each house is assigned a number from 1 to 19. We can represent a pattern of mail delivery as a string of 0's and 1's, where a 0 indicates that the house does not receive mail on a given day, and a 1 indicates that the house does receive mail on that day.\n\nFor example, the pattern 01010101010101010101 represents a pattern where every other house receives mail on the same day.\n\nWe can see that any pattern of mail delivery must satisfy the following two conditions:\n1. No two adjacent houses can receive mail on the same day. (This means that there can be no two consecutive 1's in the string.)\n2. There can never be more than two houses in a row that do not receive mail on the same day. (This means that there can be no three consecutive 0's in the string.)\n\nLet us count the number of patterns that satisfy these conditions.\n\nWe can start by placing a 1 in the first position of the string. This represents the first house receiving mail on the first day.\n\nWe can then place a 0 in the second position of the string. This represents the second house not receiving mail on the first day.\n\nWe can then place a 1 in the third position of the string. This represents the third house receiving mail on the first day.\n\nWe can continue in this way, alternating between placing 1's and 0's in the string.\n\nWe will stop when we reach the end of the string.\n\nWe will have placed a total of 19 1's and 18 0's in the string.\n\nThe number of different patterns that we can create is equal to the number of ways that we can arrange these 19 1's and 18 0's in the string.\n\nThis is equal to $\\binom{19+18}{19} = \\binom{37}{19} = 12,597,400$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12,597,400$}. I hope it is correct.",
