At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSheila has been invited to a picnic tomorrow.  The picnic will occur, rain or shine.  If it rains, there is a $20\\%$ probability that Sheila will decide to go, but if it is sunny, there is an $80\\%$ probability that Sheila will decide to go.  The forecast for tomorrow states that there is a $40\\%$ chance of rain.  What is the probability that Sheila will attend the picnic? Express your answer as a percent.",
        "inference": "The probability that Sheila will go to the picnic if it rains is $0.20$.  The probability that it will rain is $0.40$.  So the probability that Sheila will go to the picnic if it rains is $0.20 \\times 0.40 = 0.08$.  The probability that Sheila will go to the picnic if it is sunny is $0.80$.  The probability that it will be sunny is $0.60$.  So the probability that Sheila will go to the picnic if it is sunny is $0.80 \\times 0.60 = 0.48$.  The probability that Sheila will go to the picnic is the sum of these two probabilities, or $0.08 + 0.48 = 0.56$.  This is equivalent to $56\\%$.\\\\\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that it rains and Sheila attends is $(0.4)(0.2) = 0.08$.  The probability that it doesn't rain and Sheila attends is $(0.6)(0.8) = 0.48$.  So the overall probability that Sheila attends is $0.08 + 0.48 = \\boxed{0.56 = 56\\%}$."
