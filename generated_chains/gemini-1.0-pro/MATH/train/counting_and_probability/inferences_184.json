There are 9 choices for the third digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8).\n4. There are 9 choices for the fourth digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8).\n\nHowever, we must subtract the number of four-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 2999.\n\n1.

So, only consider pairs of middle digits formed from choosing two numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive. There are $9 \\cdot 9$ such pairs possible. The only pairs whose product will not exceed 5 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 31, 41, and 51.
