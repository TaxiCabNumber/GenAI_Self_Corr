At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy grandpa has 10 pieces of art, including 3 prints by Escher. If he hangs the pieces of art in a row in a random order, what is the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively?",
        "inference": "There are 10! ways to arrange 10 pieces of art in a row.\n\nIf the three Escher prints are placed consecutively, there are 3! ways to arrange them.\n\nThe remaining seven pieces of art can be arranged in 7! ways.\n\nSo, there are 3! * 7! ways to arrange the pieces of art with the three Escher prints placed consecutively.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this happening is:\n\n$$P = \\frac{3! * 7!}{10!} = \\frac{3}{10} * \\frac{7}{9} * \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{21}{120} = \\frac{7}{40}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{7}{40}$} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item. It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways. There are also a total of $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions. Thus the probability that we want is $\\dfrac{8}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}}$."
