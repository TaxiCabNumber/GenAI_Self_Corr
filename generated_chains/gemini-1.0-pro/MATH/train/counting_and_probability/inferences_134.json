At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. and Mrs. Lopez have two children.  When they get into their family car, two people sit in the front, and the other two sit in the back.  Either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must sit in the driver's seat.  How many seating arrangements are possible?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**. The Lopez couple must sit in the front or back.  There are 2 possibilities.\n**Step 2**. If the Lopez couple sits in the front, then the children can be seated in the back in 2! = 2 ways.\n**Step 3**. If the Lopez couple sits in the back,  then the children can be seated in the front in 2! = 2 ways.\n**Step 4**. So, the total number of seating arrangements is 2 possibilities for the Lopez couple, multiplied by 2 possibilities for the children in each case, which equals 2 possibilities for the Lopez couple, multiplied by 2 possibilities for the children in each case, which equals 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 possible arrangements.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat. After the driver is chosen, any of the remaining three people can sit in the front, and there are two arrangements for the other two people  in the back.  Thus, there are $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 =\n\\boxed{12}$ possible seating arrangements."
