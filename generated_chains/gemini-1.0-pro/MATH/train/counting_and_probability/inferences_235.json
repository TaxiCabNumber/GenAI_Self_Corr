At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50\\}$ contains the first $50$ positive integers.  After the multiples of 2 and the multiples of 3 are removed, how many integers remain in the set $S$?",
        "inference": "1. First find the number of multiples of 2 in the set $S$. The multiples of 2 are the even numbers $2, 4, 6, \\ldots, 50$. There are $25$ even numbers in the set $S$, so $25$ of them are multiples of 2.\n\n\n2. Next, find the number of multiples of 3 in the set $S$. The multiples of 3 are $3, 6, \\ldots, 51$ because 51 is the smallest positive integer greater than 50 that is a multiple of 3. There are $17$ multiples of 3 in the set $S$.\n\n\n3. There is one number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3: $6$. So the total number of multiples of 2 or 3 in the set $S$ is $25 + 17 - 1 = 41$.\n\n\n4. The number of integers remaining in the set $S$ is $50 - 41 = 9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The set $S$ contains $25$ multiples of 2 (that is, even numbers).  When these are removed, the set $S$ is left with only the odd integers from 1 to 49. At this point, there are $50-25=25$ integers in $S$. We still need to remove the multiples of 3 from $S$.\n\nSince $S$ only contains odd integers after the multiples of 2 are removed,  we must remove the odd multiples of 3 between 1 and 49.  These are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, of which there are 8.  Therefore, the number of integers remaining in the set $S$ is $25 - 8 = \\boxed{17}$."
