        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of a professional bowling tournament, the top 5 bowlers have a playoff. First #5 bowls #4. The loser receives $5$th prize and the winner bowls #3 in another game. The loser of this game receives $4$th prize and the winner bowls #2. The loser of this game receives $3$rd prize and the winner bowls #1. The winner of this game gets 1st prize and the loser gets 2nd prize. In how many orders can bowlers #1 through #5 receive the prizes?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 24\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 120\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$\n",
        "inference": "First, there are 2 choices for who wins between #4 and #5, then 2 for who wins between #3 and the winner of the first game, then 2 for who wins between #2 and the winner of the second game, and finally 2 for who wins between #1 and the winner of the third game.  So the total number of orderings is:\n$$2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=16$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have $2$ choices for who wins the first game, and that uniquely determines $5^{\\text{th}}$ place. Then there are $2$ choices for a next game and that uniquely determines $4^{\\text{th}}$ place, followed by $2$ choices for the next game that uniquely determines $3^{\\text{rd}}$ place. Finally, there are $2$ choices for the last game, which uniquely determines both $1^{\\text{st}}$ and $2^{\\text{nd}}$ places, since the winner is $1^{\\text{st}}$ and the loser is $2^{\\text{nd}}$. Thus the number of possible orders is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{16}$."
