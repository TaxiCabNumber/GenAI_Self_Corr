At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards (13 hearts, 13 clubs, 13 spades, and 13 diamonds).  What is the probability that the first card is a 6 and the second card is a Queen?",
        "inference": "- The probability of drawing a 6 from a standard deck of 52 cards is 4 / 52 = 1 / 13.\n- After drawing a 6, there are 51 cards left in the deck, and 4 of them are Queens.\n- The probability of drawing a Queen from the remaining 51 cards is 4 / 51.\n- The probability of drawing a 6 and then a Queen is (1 / 13) * (4 / 51) = 4 / 663.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4 / 663}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the first card is a 6 is $\\dfrac{1}{13}$.  There are then 51 cards remaining, so the probability the second card is a Queen is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  The answer is then $\\dfrac{1}{13} \\times \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{663}}$."
