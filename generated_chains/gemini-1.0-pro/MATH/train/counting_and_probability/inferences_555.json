At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nContainer I holds 8 red balls and 4 green balls; containers II and III each hold 2 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. There are three containers, so the probability of selecting a container is 1/3.\n\n2. Each container has 6 balls, of which 4 are green. So the probability of selecting a green ball from a container is 4/6 = 2/3.\n\n3. The probability of selecting a green ball is the sum of the probabilities of selecting a container and then selecting a green ball from that container. Therefore, the probability of selecting a green ball is 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{2}{9}$}**.",
        "ground_truth": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container I, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$ probability for a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{9}$ probability of getting green from Container I. Similarly for container II the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{9}$, and the same for container III. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
