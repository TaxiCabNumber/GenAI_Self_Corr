At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, if all three cards must be of different suits?  (Assume that the order of the cards does not matter.)",

Finally, we can choose the suit of the third card in 2 ways (since it must be different from the first and second cards). Thus, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, if all three cards must be of different suits. \n$\\\\~\\\\$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}.$ I hope it is correct.",

The total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits is therefore $4\\cdot 2197=\\boxed{8788}$."
