At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly two of the triplets are in the starting lineup?",

        "ground_truth": "If exactly two of the triplets are in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplets to put in the starting lineup (we can see this by noting that we have 3 choices for which triplet to leave out), and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 4 spots.
