At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many license plates consist of 2 letters followed by 2 digits, if one of the digits must be odd and the other must be even?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Count the number of ways to choose the first letter. There are 26 possible letters, so there are 26 choices for the first letter.\n\n**Step 2:** Count the number of ways to choose the second letter. There are 25 remaining letters, so there are 25 choices for the second letter.\n\n**Step 3:** Count the number of ways to choose the first digit. There are 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), so there are 5 choices for the first digit.\n\n**Step 4:** Count the number of ways to choose the second digit. Since the first digit must be odd, the second digit must be even. There are 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8), so there are 5 choices for the second digit.\n\n**Step 5:** Multiply the number of choices for each step to get the total number of license plates.\n\nTotal number of license plates = 26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 16,250\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$16,250$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 26 choices of letters for each of the first two spots and 10 choices of digits for the next spot. Once the first digit has been chosen, we know whether the second digit must be even or odd. Either way, there are 5 choices for the second digit. There are a total of $26^2 \\times 10 \\times 5 = \\boxed{33,\\!800}$ different plates."
