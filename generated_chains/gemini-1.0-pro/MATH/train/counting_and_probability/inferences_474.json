        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA penny, nickel, dime, and quarter are simultaneously flipped.  What is the expected value of the amount of the coins which come up heads?  Express your answer in cents, rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* The probability of a penny landing on heads is 1/2, and the value of a penny is 1 cent. So the expected value of the penny is (1/2) * 1 = 1/2 cent.\n* The probability of a nickel landing on heads is 1/2, and the value of a nickel is 5 cents. So the expected value of the nickel is (1/2) * 5 = 2.5 cents.\n* The probability of a dime landing on heads is 1/2, and the value of a dime is 10 cents. So the expected value of the dime is (1/2) * 10 = 5 cents.\n* The probability of a quarter landing on heads is 1/2, and the value of a quarter is 25 cents. So the expected value of the quarter is (1/2) * 25 = 12.5 cents.\n\nThe expected value of the total amount of money that will land on heads is the sum of the expected values of each coin:\n\nExpected value = (1/2) + (2.5) + (5) + (12.5) = 21 cents\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$21}$ cents. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ probability that each coin comes up heads, so the expected value of the coins, in cents, that come up heads is $\\dfrac{1}{2}(1 + 5+ 10 + 25) = \\boxed{20.5}$."
