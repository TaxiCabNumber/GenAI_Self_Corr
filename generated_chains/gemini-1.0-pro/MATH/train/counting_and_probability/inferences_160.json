At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pizza parlor offers six toppings. What is the greatest number of four-topping pizzas that can be made such that no two pizzas have the same topping combination?",
        "inference": "There are 6 choices for the first topping, 5 choices for the second, 4 choices for the third, and 3 choices for the fourth. So, the total number of possible combinations is $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 360$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{360}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 6 choices of toppings, and each pizza must have 4 of them, there are ${6 \\choose 4} = \\boxed{15}$ four-topping pizzas."
