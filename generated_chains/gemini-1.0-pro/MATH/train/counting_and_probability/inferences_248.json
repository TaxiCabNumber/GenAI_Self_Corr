        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe planning committee at school has 10 members. Exactly four of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
        "inference": "There are 10C4 = 210 ways to choose a four-person subcommittee from the 10 members of the planning committee.\n\nThere are 4C1 * 6C3 = 120 ways to choose a subcommittee with exactly one teacher.\n\nThere are 4C2 * 6C2 = 90 ways to choose a subcommittee with exactly two teachers.\n\nThere are 4C3 * 6C1 = 40 ways to choose a subcommittee with exactly three teachers.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct subcommittees with at least one member who is a teacher is 210 - 120 + 90 - 40 = 140.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{140}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 4 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${10 \\choose 4} = 210$ subcomittees. The number of subcomittees with 0 teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 6 nonteachers, totaling ${6 \\choose 4} = 15$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least 1 teacher is $210 - 15 = \\boxed{195}$."
