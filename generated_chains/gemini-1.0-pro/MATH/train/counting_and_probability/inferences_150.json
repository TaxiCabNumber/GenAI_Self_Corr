At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA yogurt shop sells four flavors of yogurt and has six different toppings. How many combinations of one flavor and two different toppings are available?",
        "inference": "There are four flavors of yogurt to choose from and six different toppings. To choose one flavor, there are 4 ways. To choose two different toppings, there are 6 choose 2 ways, which is 6 * 5 / 2 = 15 ways. Therefore, the total number of combinations is 4 * 15 = 60.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 choices of flavor, and $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose two of the six toppings. The total number of combinations is $4\\cdot 15=\\boxed{60}$."
