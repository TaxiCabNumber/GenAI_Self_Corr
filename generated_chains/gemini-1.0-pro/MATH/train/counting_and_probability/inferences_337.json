At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a sequence of coin tosses, one can keep a record of instances in which a tail is immediately followed by a head, a head is immediately followed by a head, and etc. We denote these by TH, HH, and etc. For example, in the sequence TTTHHTHTTTHHTTH of 15 coin tosses we observe that there are two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences. How many different sequences of 15 coin tosses will contain exactly two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences?\n",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nLet $a$ be the number of H's and $b$ be the number of T's. Then $a+b=15$.  The number of HH's is $\\binom{a}{2}$, the number of HT's is $a\\binom{b}{1}$, the number of TH's is $b\\binom{a}{1}$, and the number of TT's is $\\binom{b}{2}$.  Therefore, the number of different sequences of 15 coin tosses with exactly two HH's, three HT's, four TH's, and five TT's is\n\n$$\\binom{a}{2}\\binom{b}{1}^3\\binom{a}{1}^4\\binom{b}{2}^5$$\n\nand this is maximized when\n\n$$\\frac{\\binom{a}{2}\\binom{b}{1}^3\\binom{a}{1}^4\\binom{b}{2}^5}{\\binom{15}{2}\\binom{15}{1}^3\\binom{15}{1}^4\\binom{15}{2}^5}=1$$\n\nwhich occurs when $a=5$ and $b=10$.  Therefore, the number of different sequences of 15 coin tosses with exactly two HH's, three HT's, four TH's, and five TT's is\n\n$$\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{10}{1}^3\\binom{5}{1}^4\\binom{10}{2}^5=\\boxed{462}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{462}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let's consider each of the sequences of two coin tosses as an operation instead; this operation takes a string and adds the next coin toss on (eg, THHTH + HT = THHTHT). We examine what happens to the last coin toss. Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now. However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin. H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.\nNow we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in. There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts. There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument. We want to add 5 balls into 4 urns, which is the same as 3 dividers; hence this gives ${{5+3}\\choose3} = 56$ combinations. We do the same with 2 Hs to get ${{2+3}\\choose3} = 10$ combinations; thus there are $56 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{560}$ possible sequences."
