What number should we remove if we wish to maximize the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is 10?",

There are $$\\binom{11}{2} = 55$$ ways to choose two distinct integers from this list, and the sum of these two integers is $10$ in $6$ ways: $$(1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5), (11, -1)$$.  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is $10$ is $$\\frac{6}{55} = \\frac{6}{55}$$.\n\nIf we remove any other integer from the list, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is $10$ will be less than $\\frac{6}{55}$.  For example, if we remove the integer $1$, then the remaining list is $$-1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$$.  There are $$\\binom{11}{2} = 55$$ ways to choose two distinct integers from this list, and the sum of these two integers is $10$ in $5$ ways: $$(0, 10), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 5)$$.  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is $10$ is $$\\frac{5}{55} = \\frac{5}{55}$$.\n\nTherefore, the integer that we should remove is $0$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{6}{55}} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For each integer $x$ in the list besides 5, the integer $10-x$ is also in the list.  So, for each of these integers, removing $x$ reduces the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10.  However, there is no other integer in list that can be added to 5 to give 10, so removing 5 from the list will not reduce the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 10.\n\nSince removing any integer besides 5 will reduce the number of pairs that add to 10, while removing 5 will leave the number of pairs that add to 10 unchanged, we have the highest probability of having a sum of 10 when we remove $\\boxed{5}$."
