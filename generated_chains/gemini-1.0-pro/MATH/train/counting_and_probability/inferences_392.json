At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ such that $a+b=1000$ and neither $a$ nor $b$ has a zero digit.\n",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: For $a$ not to have a zero digit, each of its digits must be at least 1. Since $a+b=1000$, we know $a$ is at most 999.\n\n**Step 2**: Now, let's consider the possible values of $b$. For $b$ not to have a zero digit, each of its digits must be at least 1. Since $1+1=2$, $b$ is at least 2. Since $a+b=1000$, we know $b$ is at most 998.\n\n**Step 3**: There are 9 choices for the first digit of $a$, since it must be at least 1. For each choice of the first digit, there are 9 choices for the second digit, since it cannot be 0 or the same as the first digit. For each choice of the first two digits, there are 8 choices for the third digit, since it cannot be 0 or the same as the first two digits. Therefore, there are $9\\cdot9\\cdot8=\\boxed{648}$ possible values of $a$.\n\n**Step 4**: For each value of $a$, there is exactly one corresponding value of $b$ such that $a+b=1000$. Therefore, there are $648$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a+b=1000$ and neither $a$ nor $b$ has a zero digit.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{648}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{999}{10}\\right\\rfloor = 99$ numbers up to 1000 that have 0 as their units digit. All of the other excluded possibilities are when $a$ or $b$ have a 0 in the tens digit, and since the equation is symmetric, we will just count when $a$ has a 0 in the tens digit and multiply by 2 (notice that the only time both $a$ and $b$ can have a 0 in the tens digit is when they are divisible by 100, which falls into the above category, so we do not have to worry about overcounting).\nExcluding the numbers divisible by 100, which were counted already, there are $9$ numbers in every hundred numbers that have a tens digit of 0 (this is true from 100 to 900), totaling $9 \\cdot 9 = 81$ such numbers; considering $b$ also and we have $81 \\cdot 2 = 162$. Therefore, there are $999 - (99 + 162) = \\boxed{738}$ such ordered pairs."
