At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "1. First, calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four six-sided dice. There are six possible outcomes for each die, so the total number of outcomes is 6^4 = 1296.\n\n2. Next, calculate the number of outcomes in which Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are two possible ways to do this:\n   - Roll exactly one 1 and three other numbers. There are 5 choices for the other three numbers, and 6 choices for the die that rolls a 1. So there are 5 * 6 = 30 outcomes of this type.\n   - Roll exactly two 1's and two other numbers. There are 5 choices for the other two numbers, and 6 choices for each die that rolls a 1. So there are 5 * 6 * 6 = 180 outcomes of this type.\n\n3. So, the total number of outcomes in which Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is 30 + 180 = 210.\n\n4. Finally, calculate the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n```\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 210 / 1296\nProbability = 0.162\n```\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.162$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$."
