At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",

There are 10!/4! ways to arrange the four vertices in a cyclic order. However, half of these arrangements will result in a concave quadrilateral, so there are 10!/4!/2 ways to arrange the vertices in a convex quadrilateral.\n- Combining these results, we find that there are 10C4 * 10!/4!/2 = 3150 different convex quadrilaterals.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3150}.
