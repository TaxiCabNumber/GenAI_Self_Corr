        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cube 4 units on each side is composed of 64 unit cubes. Two faces of the larger cube that share an edge are painted blue, and the cube is disassembled into 64 unit cubes. Two of the unit cubes are selected uniformly at random. What is the probability that one of two selected unit cubes will have exactly two painted faces while the other unit cube has no painted faces?",
        "inference": "There are 24 unit cubes with two painted faces and 40 unit cubes with no painted faces.  Since the cubes are chosen uniformly at random, there are 24/64 * 40/63 = 10/21 possibilities of choosing one cube with two painted faces and one cube with no painted faces.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{10}{21}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 cubes with 2 painted faces, 24 with 1, and 36 with none. There are $\\binom{64}{2} = \\frac{64\\cdot 63}{2 \\cdot 1} = 2016$ ways to choose two cubes.  There are 4 ways to choose a cube painted on exactly two sides, and 36 ways to choose one that is not painted at all, for a total of $4\\cdot 36=144$ successful outcomes. Therefore, the desired probability is $\\frac{144}{2016} = \\frac{36}{504} = \\frac{9}{126} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}$."
