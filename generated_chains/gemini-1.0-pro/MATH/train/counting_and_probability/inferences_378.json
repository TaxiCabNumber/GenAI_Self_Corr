        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn integer between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive, is called balanced if the sum of its two leftmost digits equals the sum of its two rightmost digits. How many balanced integers are there?\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:** There are $9\\times9=81$ possible pairs of leftmost digits, and for each such pair there are $9\\times9=81$ possible pairs of rightmost digits.  However, we have counted each pair of digits twice, so the number of balanced integers is $\\frac{81\\times81}{2}=3321$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3321}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the common sum of the first two and last two digits is $n$, such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 9$, there are $n$ choices for the first two digits and $n + 1$ choices for the second two digits (since zero may not be the first digit). This gives $\\sum_{n = 1}^9 n(n + 1) = 330$ balanced numbers. If the common sum of the first two and last two digits is $n$, such that $10 \\leq n \\leq 18$, there are $19 - n$ choices for both pairs. This gives $\\sum_{n = 10}^{18} (19 - n)^2 = \\sum_{n = 1}^9 n^2 = 285$ balanced numbers. Thus, there are in total $330 + 285 = \\boxed{615}$ balanced numbers.\nBoth summations may be calculated using the formula for the sum of consecutive squares, namely $\\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$."
