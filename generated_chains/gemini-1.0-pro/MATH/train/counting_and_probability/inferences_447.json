        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA paperboy delivers newspapers to 10 houses along Main Street. Wishing to save effort, he doesn't always deliver to every house, but to avoid being fired he never misses three consecutive houses. Compute the number of ways the paperboy could deliver papers in this manner.\n",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe paperboy can deliver papers in this manner if he skips 1, 2, or 3 houses. If he skips 1 house, he can do it in 10 ways. If he skips 2 houses, he can do it in 9 ways. If he skips 3 houses, he can do it in 8 ways. Therefore, the total number of ways he can deliver papers is $10+9+8=\\boxed{27}$.\nFinal Answer: $27$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can find a recursion. Let $D_n$ be the number of legal delivery sequences for $n$ houses. If a sequence ends with a delivery, we simply append one to $D_{n - 1}$. If it ends in $1$ nondelivery, we append a nondelivery and a delivery to $D_{n - 2}$. If it ends in $2$ nondeliveries, we append them and a delivery to $D_{n - 3}$. So\n$D_n = D_{n - 1} + D_{n - 2} + D_{n - 3}$.\nThus, since clearly $D_1 = 2$, $D_2 = 4$, $D_3 = 7$, we have $D_4 = 13$, $D_5 = 24$, $D_6 = 44$, $D_7 = 81$, $D_8 = 149$, $D_9 = 274$, $D_{10} = \\boxed{504}$."
