At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Grammar club has 20 members: 10 boys and 10 girls.  A 4-person committee is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl?",
