At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of the year, the Math Club decided to hold an election for which 5 equal officer positions were available. However, 16 candidates were nominated, of whom 7 were past officers. Of all possible elections of the officers, how many will have at least 1 of the past officers?",

Of these, the number of ways to choose the officers without ANY of the past officers is $\\binom{9}{5} = 126$. Thus, the number of ways to choose the 5 officers with at least 1 past officer is $4368 - 126 = \\boxed{4242}.$"
