At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nContainer A holds 4 red balls and 6 green balls; containers B and C each hold 6 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 3 containers.\nEach container has 10 balls.\nThere are 4 green balls in container A, 4 in B, and 4 in C for a total of 12 green balls.\nThe probability of selecting a green ball is 12/30 = 2/5.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{2/5}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container A, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$ probability of drawing green, which means we have  a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ of picking Container A and then picking a green ball. Similarly for container B the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{15}$, and the same for container C. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} =\\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}$."
