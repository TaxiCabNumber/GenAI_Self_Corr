How many distinct convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all) of the ten points as vertices?\n",
        "inference": "There are 10 points on a circle. For each point, there are 9 possible edges to other points. Therefore, there are 10 * 9 = 90 possible edges.\nFor each edge, there are 2 possible orientations. Therefore, there are 90 * 2 = 180 possible directed edges.\nA convex polygon of n sides has n directed edges. Therefore, there are 180 possible directed edges for convex polygons of 3 or more sides.\nTo count the number of distinct convex polygons, we need to divide by the number of orientations of each polygon.\nA polygon of n sides has n orientations. Therefore, we divide by 3 for triangles, 4 for quadrilaterals, 5 for pentagons, and so on.\nThe number of distinct convex polygons of 3 or more sides is:\n180 / 3 + 180 / 4 + 180 / 5 + ... + 180 / 10\n= 60 + 45 + 36 + 30 + 24 + 20 + 18 + 16 + 15 + 14\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$278$}.

        "ground_truth": "Any subset of the ten points with three or more members can be made into exactly one such polygon. Thus, we need to count the number of such subsets. There are $2^{10} = 1024$ total subsets of a ten-member set, but of these ${10 \\choose 0} = 1$ have 0 members, ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$ have 1 member and ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ have 2 members. Thus the answer is $1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = \\boxed{968}$."
