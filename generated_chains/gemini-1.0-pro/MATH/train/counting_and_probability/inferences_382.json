At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 10,000 have at most two different digits?\n",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** There are 10 digits to choose from (0 to 9). \n**Step 2:** If the number has only one different digit, it can be any of the 10 digits. So, there are 10 such numbers.\n**Step 3:** If the number has two different digits, the first digit can be any of the 10 digits, and the second digit can be any of the remaining 9 digits. So, there are 10 x 9 = 90 such numbers.\n**Step 4:** The total number of positive integers less than 10,000 with at most two different digits is 10 + 90 = 100.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, let's count numbers with only a single digit. We have nine of these for each length, and four lengths, so 36 total numbers.\nNow, let's count those with two distinct digits. We handle the cases \"0 included\" and \"0 not included\" separately.\nThere are ${9 \\choose 2}$ ways to choose two digits, $A$ and $B$. Given two digits, there are $2^n - 2$ ways to arrange them in an $n$-digit number, for a total of $(2^1 - 2) + (2^2 - 2) + (2^3 -2) + (2^4 - 2) = 22$ such numbers (or we can list them: $AB, BA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB, BBA, AAAB, AABA, ABAA,$ $BAAA, AABB, ABAB, BAAB, ABBA, BABA, BBAA, ABBB, BABB, BBAB, BBBA$). Thus, we have ${9 \\choose 2} \\cdot 22 = 36\\cdot22 = 792$ numbers of this form.\nNow, suppose 0 is one of our digits. We have nine choices for the other digit. For each choice, we have $2^{n - 1} - 1$ $n$-digit numbers we can form, for a total of $(2^0 - 1) + (2^1 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^3 - 1) = 11$ such numbers (or we can list them: $A0, A00, A0A, AA0, A000, AA00, A0A0, A00A, AAA0, AA0A, A0AA$). This gives us $9\\cdot 11 = 99$ numbers of this form.\nThus, in total, we have $36 + 792 + 99 = \\boxed{927}$ such numbers."
