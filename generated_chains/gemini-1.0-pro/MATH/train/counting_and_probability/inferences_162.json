At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have 3 boys and 3 girls?",

The number of ways to do this is C(6, 3) = 20.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 girls.**\n\nThere are 8 girls, so we need to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to do this is C(8, 3) = 56.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose 3 boys by the number of ways to choose 3 girls.**\n\nThe number of ways to select a team to have 3 boys and 3 girls is 20 * 56 = 1120.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1120}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We are picking 3 boys out of 6, so there are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ options for the boys on the team.  We are picking 3 girls out of 8, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ options for the girls on the team.  This gives a total of $20 \\times 56 = \\boxed{1120}$ choices."
