I hope it is correct.'\nJohn has 12 marbles of different colors, including one red, one green, and one blue marble. In how many ways can he choose 4 marbles, if exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nTotal number of marbles = 12\nNumber of ways to choose 4 marbles = $^{12}C_4$\n\nNow, we know that exactly one of the chosen marbles must be red, green, or blue. So, there are 3 ways to choose this marble, and the remaining 3 marbles can be chosen in $^{9}C_3$ ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with exactly one of them being red, green, or blue is:\n\n$$^{3}C_1 \\cdot ^{9}C_3$$\n\n$$= 3 \\cdot \\frac{9!}{3!6!}$$\n\n$$= 3 \\cdot \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}$$\n\n$$= 3 \\cdot 84$$\n\n**Final Answer: $252$.
