Three other numbers, $b_1\\,$, $b_2\\,$, $b_3\\,$, are then drawn randomly and without replacement from the remaining set of 997 numbers. Let $p\\,$ be the probability that, after a suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions $a_1 \\times a_2 \\times a_3\\,$ can be enclosed in a box of dimensions $b_1 \\times b_2 \\times b_3\\,$, with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box.
