The third person can be chosen in 7 ways.\n**Step 5:** Once the third person is chosen, there are 6 people left to choose from. The fourth person can be chosen in 6 ways.\n**Step 6:** Multiply the number of ways to choose each person to get the total number of ways to choose a 4-person committee.\n9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 3024.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3024$}.
