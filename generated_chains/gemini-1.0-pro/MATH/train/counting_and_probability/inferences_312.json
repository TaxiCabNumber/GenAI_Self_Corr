At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMax picks two different cards without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the cards are of different suits?",
        "inference": "There are 52 different cards in a standard deck. There are 4 different suits in a deck (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 2 cards from 52 cards.**\nTotal number of ways = 52C2 = 1326\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 cards of the same suit from 52 cards.**\nThere are 4 different suits, and for each suit, there are 13 different cards. So, the number of ways to choose 2 cards of the same suit is:\nNumber of ways = 4 * 13C2 = 221\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose 2 cards of different suits from 52 cards.**\nThe number of ways to choose 2 cards of different suits is the total number of ways to choose 2 cards minus the number of ways to choose 2 cards of the same suit:\nNumber of ways = 1326 - 221 = 1105\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the probability of choosing 2 cards of different suits.**\nProbability = Number of ways to choose 2 cards of different suits / Total number of ways to choose 2 cards\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1105/1326}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Once Max has chosen the first card, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 39 do not have the same suit as the first chosen card.  Therefore, the probability that the two cards have different suits is $\\dfrac{39}{51} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}$."
