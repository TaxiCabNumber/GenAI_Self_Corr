        "inference": "First, find the number of ways to draw 3 balls from a bin with 15 balls:\n$C(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} = \\frac{15!}{3!12!} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 455$\n\nNext, find the number of ways to draw 2 black balls and 1 white ball:\n$C(8, 2) \\cdot C(7, 1) = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} \\cdot \\frac{7!}{1!(7-1)!} = \\frac{8!}{2!6!} \\cdot \\frac{7!}{1!6!} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2 \\cdot 1} \\cdot \\frac{7}{1} = 196$\n\nFinally, find the probability of drawing 2 of one color and 1 of the other color:\n$P = \\frac{196}{455} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 49}{9 \\cdot 49} = \\frac{4}{9}$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$**.

        "ground_truth": "The number of ways to draw out 3 balls from 15 is $\\binom{15}{3}=455$.  We can choose 2 black balls and 1 white ball in $\\binom{8}{2}\\binom{7}{1}=196$ ways.  We can pick 1 black ball and 2 white balls in $\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{7}{2}=168$ ways.  Therefore we have $196+168=364$ ways to satisfy the condition, so the answer is $\\dfrac{364}{455}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
