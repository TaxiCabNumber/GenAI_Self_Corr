I hope it is correct.'\nEach block on the grid shown in the Figure is 1 unit by 1 unit.

How many different paths can we take?[asy]size(3cm,3cm);int w=5;int h=4;int i;for (i=0; i<h; ++i){draw((0,i) -- (w-1,i));}for (i=0; i<w; ++i){draw((i, 0)--(i,h-1));}label(\"B\", (w-1,h-1), NE);label(\"A\", (0,0), SW);[/asy]",
        "inference": "There are 6 vertical steps and 1 horizontal step in the 7-unit path.  In choosing the vertical steps, we have 6 positions from which to choose and select the 1, so we have $C(6, 1)$ choices.  Similarly, in choosing the horizontal step, we have $C(1, 1)$ choices.  Therefore, the number of different paths is: $$C(6, 1) \\cdot C(1, 1) = \\boxed{6}.$$ \n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that we must take a 7 unit path.  If we look at the grid a little more carefully, we can see that our path must consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and we can take those steps in any order.  So in order to specify a path, we must choose 3 of our 7 steps to be `up' (and the other 4 steps will thus be `right').  Hence the number of paths is $$ \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{35}. $$"
