        "inference": "The multiples of $7$ less than $1000$ are: $7, 14, 21, 28, \\cdots, 994$. To determine how many of these multiples end with the digit $3$, we need to count the number of multiples of $7$ that are in the form $7k + 3$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nWe can start by finding the smallest multiple of $7$ that ends with the digit $3$. This is $3$. We can then find the largest multiple of $7$ that ends with the digit $3$ and is less than $1000$. This is $993$.\n\nNow, we can count the number of multiples of $7$ between $3$ and $993$ that end with the digit $3$. This is simply the number of multiples of $7$ in the interval $[3, 993]$.\n\nWe can use the formula for the number of multiples of $n$ in the interval $[a, b]$:\n\n$$N = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{b}{n} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a-1}{n} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of multiples of $n$ in the interval, $a$ is the lower bound of the interval, $b$ is the upper bound of the interval, and $n$ is the number we are finding multiples of.\n\nIn this case, $n = 7$, $a = 3$, and $b = 993$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$N = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{993}{7} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 141 - 0 = 141$$\n\nTherefore, there are $141$ positive multiples of $7$ that are less than $1000$ and end with the digit $3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{141}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Listing the first 10 multiples of 7, which are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, we see that the only positive multiples of 7 that end in 3 are those that are the product of 7 and a number that ends in 9.  Therefore, the positive multiples of 7 that are less than 1000 and end with the digit 3 are $7\\cdot 9 = 63$, $7\\cdot 19= 133$, $7\\cdot 29 = 203$, . . .  Notice that we can get from each to the next by adding $7\\cdot 10 = 70$, so our multiples of 7 less than 1000 that end with the digit 3 are 63, 133, 203, . . ., 903, 973.  The last one is 910 more than the first. Since $910/70=13$, we see that we have taken 13 steps of 70 to get from the first number in the list to the last. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{14}$ numbers in the list."
