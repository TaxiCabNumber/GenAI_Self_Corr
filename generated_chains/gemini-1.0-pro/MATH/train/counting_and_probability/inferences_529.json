        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAllison, Brian and Noah each have a 6-sided cube. All of the faces on Allison's cube have a 5. The faces on Brian's cube are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Three of the faces on Noah's cube have a 2 and three of the faces have a 6. All three cubes are rolled. What is the probability that Allison's roll is greater than each of Brian's and Noah's? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability that Allison's roll is greater than Brian's.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes for each die. For Allison to roll greater than Brian, she would need to roll a 5 or a 6. There are 2 out of 6 outcomes (5 or 6) that are greater than Brian's roll. So the probability that Allison's roll is greater than Brian's is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability that Allison's roll is greater than Noah's.\n\nThere are 6 possible outcomes for each die. For Allison to roll greater than Noah, she would need to roll a 5 or a 6. There are 2 out of 6 outcomes (5 or 6) that are greater than Noah's roll. So the probability that Allison's roll is greater than Noah's is 2/6 = 1/3.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the probability that Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's.\n\nThe probability that Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's is the probability that she rolls greater than Brian's multiplied by the probability that she rolls greater than Noah's. So the probability that Allison's roll is greater than both Brian's and Noah's is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{9}$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since Allison will always roll a 5, we must calculate the probability that both Brian and Noah roll a 4 or lower. The probability of Brian rolling a 4 or lower is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$ since Brian has a standard die. Noah, however, has a $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$ probability of rolling a 4 or lower, since the only way he can do so is by rolling one of his 3 sides that have a 2. So, the probability of both of these independent events occurring is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
