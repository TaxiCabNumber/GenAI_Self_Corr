At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle?",
        "inference": "The smallest four-digit number is 1000, which is 3rd row, 4th number.\nThe next bigger four-digit number is 1001, which is 4th row, 5th number.\nSo the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle is $\\boxed{1001}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1001}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$."
