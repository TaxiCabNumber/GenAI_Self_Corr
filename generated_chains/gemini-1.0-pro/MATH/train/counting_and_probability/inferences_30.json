At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal?",
        "inference": "Each die can show an even number (2, 4, or 6) or an odd number (1, 3, or 5) with equal probability. \n\nThere are 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers on a die. \n\nSo, the probability of getting an even number on a single die is 3/6 = 1/2. \n\nSimilarly, the probability of getting an odd number on a single die is also 1/2.\n\nWe roll 6 dice. Let X be the number of dice showing even numbers and Y be the number of dice showing odd numbers.\n\nWe want to find the probability that X = Y.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the probability that X + Y = 6.\n\nX + Y can take on the values 0, 2, 4, or 6.\n\nThe probability that X + Y = 0 is (1/2)^6, since all 6 dice must show odd numbers.\n\nThe probability that X + Y = 2 is 6 * (1/2)^6, since there are 6 ways to get 2 even numbers and 4 odd numbers.\n\nThe probability that X + Y = 4 is 15 * (1/2)^6, since there are 15 ways to get 4 even numbers and 2 odd numbers.\n\nThe probability that X + Y = 6 is 20 * (1/2)^6, since there are 20 ways to get 6 even numbers and 0 odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal is 15 * (1/2)^6 + 20 * (1/2)^6 = 35/64.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{35/64}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}$ ways for 3 of the dice to show even numbers and 3 of them to show odd numbers.  Each roll is even with probability $\\frac12$ and odd with probability $\\frac12$, so each arrangement of 3 odd numbers and 3 even number occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!6}$.  Thus, the probability that 3 dice out of 6 show even numbers is \\[\\binom{6}{3}\\frac{1}{2^6}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}.\\]"
