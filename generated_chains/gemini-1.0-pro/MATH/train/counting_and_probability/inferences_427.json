At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA scanning code consists of a $7 \\times 7$ grid of squares, with some of its squares colored black and the rest colored white. There must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares. A scanning code is called $\\textit{symmetric}$ if its look does not change when the entire square is rotated by a multiple of $90 ^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around its center, nor when it is reflected across a line joining opposite corners or a line joining midpoints of opposite sides. What is the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 510} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 1022} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 8190} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 8192} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 65,534}$\n",
        "inference": "Solution:\nFor a symmetric scanning code, the pattern of black and white squares must be symmetric about both diagonals, both axes, and both midlines. There are two possibilities for the center square: it can be black or white. For the four corner squares, there are two possibilities for the color of any one corner: it can be black or white. The remaining $49-5=44$ squares can be colored in any way, with $22$ black squares and $22$ white squares. Therefore, the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes is $2 \\cdot 2^4 \\cdot 2^{44} = 2^{50} = \\boxed{1024}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1024}$. I hope it is correct.",

(Note that \"I\" is left out of this labelling, so there are only 10 labels, not 11, as ending in K would suggest!)\nMore specifically, since there are $4$ given lines of symmetry ($2$ diagonals, $1$ vertical, $1$ horizontal) and they split the plot into $8$ equivalent sections, we can take just one-eighth and study it in particular. Each of these sections has $10$ distinct sub-squares, whether partially or in full. So since each can be colored either white or black, we choose $2^{10}=1024$ but then subtract the $2$ cases where all are white or all are black. That leaves us with $\\boxed{1022}$."
