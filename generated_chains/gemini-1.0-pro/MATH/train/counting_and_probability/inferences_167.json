At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of different gender?",

There are also 10 ways to choose a girl president and 10 ways to choose a boy vice-president.  So, there are a total of \\(10 \\times 10 + 10 \\times 10 = 200\\) ways to choose a president and vice-president of different genders.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{200}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 10 members of the opposite sex. The answer is $20\\times 10=\\boxed{200}$."
