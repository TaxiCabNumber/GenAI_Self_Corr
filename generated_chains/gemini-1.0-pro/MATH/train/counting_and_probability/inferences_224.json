At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can I choose 3 captains from a team of 11 people?",
        "inference": "To choose 3 captains from a team of 11 people, we can use the combination formula:\n\n```\nC(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)\n```\n\nWhere n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 11 and r = 3, so we have:\n\n```\nC(11, 3) = 11! / (3! * (11-3)!)\n= 11! / (3! * 8!)\n= 11 * 10 * 9 / 6\n= 165\n```\n\nTherefore, there are 165 ways to choose 3 captains from a team of 11 people.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{165}. I hope it is correct.",
