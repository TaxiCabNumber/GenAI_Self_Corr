At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe have a standard deck of 52 cards, with 4 cards in each of 13 ranks.  We call a 5-card poker hand a full house if the hand has 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (such as 33355 or AAAKK).  What is the probability that five cards chosen at random form a full house?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are $\\binom{13}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the three cards and $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose which three of them will be held.  There are then $\\binom{12}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the remaining two cards and $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose which two of them will be held.  So, there are \\begin{align*}\n\\binom{13}{1} \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{12}{1} \\binom{4}{2}&= \\frac{13!}{1! \\cdot 12!} \\cdot \\frac{4!}{3! \\cdot 1!} \\cdot \\frac{12!}{1! \\cdot 11!} \\cdot \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!}\\\\\n&=13\\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 12\\cdot \\frac{4}{2}\\\\\n&=13\\cdot 4\\cdot 12\\cdot 2\\\\\n&=1248.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince there are $\\binom{52}{5} = \\frac{52!}{5! \\cdot 47!} = 2,598,960$ possible five-card poker hands, the probability of getting a full house is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1248}{2,598,960}&= \\frac{3}{6495}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{6495}}$.
