        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?",
        "inference": "There are 3 choices for the first word, 2 choices for the second word, and 3 choices for the third word.  However, we need to subtract the number of sentences that have \"splargh\" followed by \"glumph,\" which is 3 * 1 * 3 = 9 sentences.  So, the final number of valid 3-word sentences is 3 * 2 * 3 - 9 = 9 - 9 = 0.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We proceed by counting the complement, or the number of invalid 3-word sentences.  A sentence is invalid precisely when it is of the form ``(word) splargh glumph'' or ``splargh glumph (word).''  There are 3 choices for the missing word in each sentence, and since each case is exclusive, we have a total of 6 invalid sentences.  Since there are $3\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = 27$ possible 3-word sentences with no restrictions, there are $27-6 = \\boxed{21}$ that satisfy the restrictions of the problem."
