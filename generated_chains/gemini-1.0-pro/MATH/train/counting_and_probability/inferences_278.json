At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same.**\n\nThere are 10 digits (0-9) to choose from. For the first digit, we can choose any of the 10 digits. For the second digit, we have 9 choices (excluding the first digit). The third digit must be the same as the first or second digit, so we have 2 choices. Thus, the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same is:\n\n10 x 9 x 2 = 180\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of three-digit numbers with adjacent digits the same.**\n\nThere are 10 digits to choose from for the first digit. For the second digit, we must choose the same digit as the first digit. For the third digit, we have 9 choices (excluding the first and second digits). Thus, the number of three-digit numbers with adjacent digits the same is:\n\n10 x 1 x 9 = 90\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of three-digit numbers with adjacent digits the same from the number of three-digit numbers with exactly two digits the same.**\n\n180 - 90 = 90\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$90$}.

        "ground_truth": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers."
