        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour packages are delivered to four houses, one to each house. If these packages are randomly delivered, what is the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 24 possible ways to deliver the packages, and in 12 of these ways, exactly two of the packages are delivered to the correct addresses. So, the probability is 12/24 = 1/2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{2}$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are 4 houses and 4 packages, we can choose ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of houses to be the pair that will receive the correct package. In that case, the other two houses must have one another's package. The probability of this occuring for any arrangement is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$, as the first fraction represents the probability of a given house getting the correct package, and the second fraction the subsequent probability that the other given house gets the correct package, and the final fraction the probability that the last two houses have each other's packages. So, the probability is $6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
