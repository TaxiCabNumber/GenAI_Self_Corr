At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of drawing a blue chip on the first draw is $\\frac{5}{8}$. The probability of drawing a yellow chip on the second draw is $\\frac{3}{8}$. The probability of drawing a blue chip on the first draw and a yellow chip on the second draw is $\\frac{5}{8} \\times \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{15}{64}$. The probability of drawing a yellow chip on the first draw and a blue chip on the second draw is $\\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{15}{64}$. The probability of drawing two chips of different colors is $\\frac{15}{64} + \\frac{15}{64} = \\frac{30}{64} = \\frac{15}{32}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$."
