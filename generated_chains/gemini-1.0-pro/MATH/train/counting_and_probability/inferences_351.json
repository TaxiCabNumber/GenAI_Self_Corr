        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStarting at $(0,0),$ an object moves in the coordinate plane via a sequence of steps, each of length one. Each step is left, right, up, or down, all four equally likely. Let $p$ be the probability that the object reaches $(2,2)$ in six or fewer steps. Given that $p$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\n",
        "inference": "Considering all paths from $(0,0)$ to $(2,2)$ in six or fewer steps, we see that such a path consists of three steps to the right and three steps up, in some order. There are $6\\choose3=20$ ways to choose which three of the six steps are to the right. So, $$p=\\frac{20}{4^6}=\\frac{5}{2^{12}}.$$ Hence, $$m+n=5+12=\\boxed{17}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "It takes an even number of steps for the object to reach $(2,2)$, so the number of steps the object may have taken is either $4$ or $6$.\nIf the object took $4$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, in some permutation. There are $\\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$ ways for these four steps of occuring, and the probability is $\\frac{6}{4^{4}}$.\nIf the object took $6$ steps, then it must have gone two steps N and two steps E, and an additional pair of moves that would cancel out, either N/S or W/E. The sequences N,N,N,E,E,S can be permuted in $\\frac{6!}{3!2!1!} = 60$ ways. However, if the first four steps of the sequence are N,N,E,E in some permutation, it would have already reached the point $(2,2)$ in four moves. There are $\\frac{4!}{2!2!}$ ways to order those four steps and $2!$ ways to determine the order of the remaining two steps, for a total of $12$ sequences that we have to exclude. This gives $60-12=48$ sequences of steps. There are the same number of sequences for the steps N,N,E,E,E,W, so the probability here is $\\frac{2 \\times 48}{4^6}$.\nThe total probability is $\\frac{6}{4^4} + \\frac{96}{4^6} = \\frac{3}{64}$, and $m+n= \\boxed{67}$."
