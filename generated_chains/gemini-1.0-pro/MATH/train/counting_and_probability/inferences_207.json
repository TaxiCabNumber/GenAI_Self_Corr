At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TOOT.",

So the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TOOT is:\n$$\\frac{4!}{2!}=\\frac{4\\times3\\times2\\times1}{2\\times1}=4\\times3=\\boxed{12}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$.

        "ground_truth": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $4!$. Then since the T's and the O's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of T's and the arrangement of O's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{6}$."
