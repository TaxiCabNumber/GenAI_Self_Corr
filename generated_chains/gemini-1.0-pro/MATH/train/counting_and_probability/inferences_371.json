At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach unit square of a 3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For each square, either color is equally likely to be used. The probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red square is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
        "inference": "If the grid does not contain a 2 x 2 square, then the grid must be colored as shown below:\n\nR R B\nR R B\nB B B\n\nThere are 9 squares in the grid, and 6 of them are red. So the probability of obtaining such a grid is $\\frac {6}{9}=\\frac {2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2 x 2 red square is $1 - \\frac {2}{3} = \\frac {1}{3} = \\frac {m}{n}$.\n\nSince m and n are relatively prime, we have $m = 1$ and $n = 3$.\n\nTherefore, $m + n = 1 + 3 = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$.
