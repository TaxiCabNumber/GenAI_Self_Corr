At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDefine an ordered triple $(A, B, C)$ of sets to be minimally intersecting if $|A \\cap B| = |B \\cap C| = |C \\cap A| = 1$ and $A \\cap B \\cap C = \\emptyset$. For example, $(\\{1,2\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{1,3,4\\})$ is a minimally intersecting triple. Let $N$ be the number of minimally intersecting ordered triples of sets for which each set is a subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
        "inference": "We can use the following strategy to count the number of minimally intersecting triples:\n\n- For each element $x \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, we can choose to include it in set $A$, set $B$, or set $C$. This gives us $3^7$ choices.\n\n\n- However, we need to exclude the cases where $A \\cap B \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset$. There are $7$ elements in the intersection of sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, so there are $\\binom{7}{1} = 7$ ways to choose one element to be in the intersection.\n\n\n- We also need to exclude the cases where $|A \\cap B| \\neq 1$. There are $6$ elements in the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, so there are $\\binom{6}{1} = 6$ ways to choose one element to be in the intersection.\n\n\n- Similarly, there are $\\binom{6}{1}$ ways to choose one element to be in the intersection of sets $B$ and $C$, and $\\binom{6}{1}$ ways to choose one element to be in the intersection of sets $C$ and $A$.\n\n\n- Therefore, the total number of minimally intersecting triples is $3^7 - 7\\binom{7}{1} - 4\\binom{6}{1} = 2187 - 7(7) - 4(6) = 1968$.\n\n\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{68}.

There are $4$ unpicked numbers, and each number can either go in the first set, second set, third set, or none of them. Since we have $4$ choices for each of $4$ numbers, that gives us $4^4 = 256$.\nFinally, $256 \\cdot 210 = 53760$, so the answer is $\\boxed{760}$."
