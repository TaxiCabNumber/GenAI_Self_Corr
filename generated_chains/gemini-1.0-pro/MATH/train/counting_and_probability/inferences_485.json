At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is an integer that reads the same forward and backward, such as 3663. What percent of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5?",
        "inference": "We will first count the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500. There are 9 choices for the first digit, and for each choice, there are 10 choices for the last digit, so there are 90 palindromes with two digits. There are 9 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, and 9 choices for the last digit, so there are 9 * 10 * 9 = 810 palindromes with three digits. There are 9 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second and third digits, and 9 choices for the last digit, so there are 9 * 10 * 10 * 9 = 7290 palindromes with four digits. So the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500 is 90 + 810 + 7290 = 8190.\n\nNow we will count the number of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5. There are 9 choices for the first digit, and for each choice, there are 10 choices for the last digit, so there are 90 palindromes with two digits that do not contain a 5. There are 9 choices for the first digit, 9 choices for the second digit, and 10 choices for the last digit, so there are 9 * 9 * 10 = 810 palindromes with three digits that do not contain a 5. There are 9 choices for the first digit, 9 choices for the second and third digits, and 10 choices for the last digit, so there are 9 * 9 * 9 * 10 = 7290 palindromes with four digits that do not contain a 5. So the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500 that do not contain a 5 is 90 + 810 + 7290 = 8190.\n\nTherefore, the number of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is 8190 - 8190 = 0. So the percent of the palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is 0/8190 * 100 = 0%.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$."
