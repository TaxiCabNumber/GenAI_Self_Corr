At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe will randomly select two letters from the word CAMP, four letters from the word HERBS, and three letters from the word GLOW.  What is the probability that he will have all of the letters from the word PROBLEM?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The word PROBLEM has 7 letters.  Since Joe is randomly selecting letters from three different words, we can use the multiplication principle to find the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n$$\\text{Total outcomes} = \\binom{4}{2}\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\\frac{5!}{4!1!}\\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 6\\cdot5\\cdot4 = 120.$$\n\nTo find the number of outcomes where Joe has all of the letters from the word PROBLEM, we need to find the number of ways he can select each letter from the correct word.  There is only one way to select each of the letters P, R, O, B, and M, since each of these letters appears only once in the three words.  There are two ways to select the letter E, since it appears twice in the three words.  Thus, the number of outcomes where Joe has all of the letters from the word PROBLEM is:\n\n$$1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot1 = 2.$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that Joe will have all of the letters from the word PROBLEM is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{120} = \\frac{1}{60}}.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{1}{60}}.

        "ground_truth": "Each letter in the word PROBLEM appears exactly once among the words CAMP, HERBS, and GLOW.  Therefore, in order to have all of the letters to spell PROBLEM, Joe must select both M and P when choosing two letters from CAMP.  The probability of this is $1/\\binom{4}{2}=1/6$.  Also, he must select the letters E, R, and B when choosing four letters from the word HERBS.  Among the $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain all of the letters E, R, and B.  Therefore, the probability that he will select E, R, and B from HERBS is 2/5.  Finally, Joe must select L and O among the 3 letters he chooses from GLOW.  Among the $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways of choosing these letters, 2 of them contain both L and O.  Therefore, the probability that he will select L and O from GLOW is $2/4=1/2$.  Altogether, the probability that he will select all the letters from the word PROBLEM is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{30}}$."
