At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 4 red marbles, 5 white marbles, and 6 blue marbles.  Three marbles are drawn from the bag (without replacement).  What is the probability that they are all the same color?",
        "inference": "The probability of drawing a red marble is 4/15, since there are 4 red marbles out of a total of 15 marbles in the bag.\n\nThe probability of drawing a second red marble is 3/14, since there are 3 red marbles left out of a total of 14 marbles in the bag after the first marble is drawn.\n\nThe probability of drawing a third red marble is 2/13, since there are 2 red marbles left out of a total of 13 marbles in the bag after the second marble is drawn.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three red marbles in a row is (4/15) * (3/14) * (2/13) = 24/2730 = 8/910.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing three white marbles in a row is (5/15) * (4/14) * (3/13) = 60/2730 = 20/910.\n\nAnd the probability of drawing three blue marbles in a row is (6/15) * (5/14) * (4/13) = 120/2730 = 40/910.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three marbles of the same color is 8/910 + 20/910 + 40/910 = 68/910 = 34/455.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{34}{455}}$ I hope it is correct.",
