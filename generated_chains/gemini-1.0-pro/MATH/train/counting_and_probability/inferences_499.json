At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour red candies and three green candies can be combined to make many different flavors. Flavors are different if the percent red is different, so 3 red / 0 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 0 green; and likewise 4 red / 2 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 1 green. If a flavor is to be made using some or all of the seven candies, how many different flavors are possible?",
        "inference": "There are 7 candies, so we can choose any subset of them. There are 2^7 = 128 subsets. However, some of these subsets are equivalent, as noted in the problem.\n\nFor example, the subset {1 red, 1 green} is equivalent to the subset {2 red}, since both have 50% red.\n\nTo count the number of distinct flavors, we need to count the number of distinct subsets up to equivalence.\n\nWe can do this by considering the number of red candies in the subset.\n\nThere are 5 choices for the number of red candies: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor each choice of the number of red candies, there is only 1 equivalent subset.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 distinct flavors.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Denote the ratio by $x:y$, where $x$ is the number of red candies and $y$ is the number of green. We can have $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ red candies and $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ green candies. Thus, there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ potential ratios. However, a $0:0$ ratio is not allowed (there would be no candy!), so we subtract one for a total of $19$ ratios possible. Now we must subtract the ratios we've over-counted. In particular, $0:1$ is the same as $0:2$ and $0:3$, and $1:0$ is the same as $2:0$, $3:0$, and $4:0$. Also, $1:1$ is the same as $2:2$ and $3:3$, and $2:1$ is the same as $4:2$. Thus, we have over-counted by $8$ ratios, so our final answer is $19 - 8 = \\boxed{11}$."
