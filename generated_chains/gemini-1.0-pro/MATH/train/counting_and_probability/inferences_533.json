At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMonica tosses a fair 6-sided die.  If the roll is a prime number, then she wins that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if she rolls 3, then she wins 3 dollars).  If the roll is composite, she wins nothing. Otherwise, she loses 3 dollars. What is the expected value of her winnings on one die toss? Express your answer as a dollar value to the nearest cent.",
