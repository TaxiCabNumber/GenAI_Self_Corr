        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKeisha's basketball team must decide on a new uniform.  The seventh-graders will pick the color of the shorts (black or gold) and the eighth-graders will pick the color of the jersey (black, white, or gold), but the two groups of players will not confer together.  If, for both garments, each possible color is equally likely to be chosen, what is the probability that the shorts will be a different color than the jersey? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $2$ choices for the shorts and $3$ choices for the jersey. If the probability of shorts of a given color is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of a given jersey color is $\\frac{1}{3}$, then the probability of the shorts and jersey being the same color is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$.\nSince the shorts and jersey will be a different color with probability $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will count the number of garment configurations in which the garments do not match color and divide by the total number of garment configurations in order to find the probability that the garments do not match. If the seventh-graders choose a black garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose such that the garments don't match: white and gold. If the seventh-graders choose a gold garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose to not match: black and white. Thus, there are $2+2=4$ garment configurations such that the garments don't match. The total number of garment configurations is $2\\cdot3=6$ (one of two shorts and one of three jerseys), so the probability that the garments don't match is $4/6=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
