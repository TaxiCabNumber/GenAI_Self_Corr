At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 10-digit positive integers have all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's?\n",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose the positions of the two consecutive 1's is 9. For each of these choices, there are 2 choices for each of the other 8 digits. So, the total number of 10-digit positive integers with all digits either 1 or 2, and have two consecutive 1's is:\n$$9\\times2^8=9\\times256=\\boxed{2304}.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2304}.

        "ground_truth": "We take as our universe the set of 10-digit integers whose digits are all either 1 or 2, of which there are $2^{10}$, and we count the complement. The complement is the set of 10-digit positive integers composed of the digits 1 and 2 with no two consecutive 1s. Counting such numbers is a popular combinatorial problem: we approach it via a recursion.\nThere are two \"good\" one-digit numbers (1 and 2) and three good two-digit numbers (12, 21 and 22). Each such $n$-digit number is formed either by gluing \"2\" on to the end of a good $(n - 1)$-digit number or by gluing \"21\" onto the end of a good $(n - 2)$-digit number. This is a bijection between the good $n$-digit numbers and the union of the good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. Thus, the number of good $n$-digit numbers is the sum of the number of good $(n-1)$- and $(n - 2)$-digit numbers. The resulting recursion is exactly that of the Fibonacci numbers with initial values $F_1 = 2$ and $F_2 = 3$.\nThus, our final answer is $2^{10} - F_{10} = 1024 - 144 = \\boxed{880}$."
