        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven the nine-sided regular polygon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6A_7A_8A_9$, how many distinct equilateral triangles in the plane of the polygon have at least two vertices in the set $\\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots A_9\\}$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThere are 9 choices for the first vertex of the triangle, 8 choices for the second vertex, and 7 choices for the third vertex. Since the triangle is equilateral, the order of the vertices does not matter. So, the number of distinct equilateral triangles is\n\n$$\\frac{9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7}{3!}=\\boxed{84}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ pairs of vertices determines two equilateral triangles, for a total of 72 triangles. However, the three triangles $A_1A_4A_7$, $A_2A_5A_8$, and $A_3A_6A_9$ are each counted 3 times, resulting in an overcount of 6. Thus, there are $\\boxed{66}$ distinct equilateral triangles."
