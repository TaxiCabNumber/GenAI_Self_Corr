At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA library has six identical copies of a certain book. At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "Since there are 6 copies of the book, there are 7 possibilities for the number of books in the library: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. For each of these possibilities, there are ${6 \\choose r}$ ways to choose which books are in the library.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the cases where at least one book is in the library and at least one book is checked out. This means that we need to exclude the case where all 6 books are in the library and the case where all 6 books are checked out.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different ways is:\n$${6 \\choose 1} + {6 \\choose 2} + {6 \\choose 3} + {6 \\choose 4} + {6 \\choose 5} -1 -1 = 31$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{31}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities."
