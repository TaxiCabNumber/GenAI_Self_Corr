At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven eight distinguishable rings, let $n$ be the number of possible five-ring arrangements on the four fingers (not the thumb) of one hand. The order of rings on each finger is significant, but it is not required that each finger have a ring. Find the leftmost three nonzero digits of $n$.\n",
        "inference": "There are $8$ rings. Each finger can have $9$ choices ($0$ rings, $1$ ring, ..., $8$ rings). So, there are $9$ ways to choose the number of rings for each finger. Thus, there are $9^4 = 6561$ choices for the number of rings on each finger. \n\nNext, we have to consider the order of the rings on each finger. On the finger with $i$ rings, there are $i!$ ways to arrange the rings. So, the total number of arrangements is $6561 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 5!$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $6561 \\cdot 120 =787,320$.\n\nThe leftmost three nonzero digits of $787,320$ are $\\boxed{787}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{787}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{8}{5}$ ways to choose the rings, and there are $5!$ distinct arrangements to order the rings [we order them so that the first ring is the bottom-most on the first finger that actually has a ring, and so forth]. The number of ways to distribute the rings among the fingers is equivalent the number of ways we can drop five balls into 4 urns, or similarly dropping five balls into four compartments split by three dividers. The number of ways to arrange those dividers and balls is just $\\binom {8}{3}$.\nMultiplying gives the answer: $\\binom{8}{5}\\binom{8}{3}5! = 376320$, and the three leftmost digits are $\\boxed{376}$."
