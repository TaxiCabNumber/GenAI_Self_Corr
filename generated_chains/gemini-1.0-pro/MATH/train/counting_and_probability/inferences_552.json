        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo tour guides are leading six tourists. The guides decide to split up. Each tourist must choose one of the guides, but with the stipulation that each guide must take at least one tourist. How many different groupings of guides and tourists are possible?",
        "inference": "Two tourists can be grouped with the first guide, and the remaining four tourists can be grouped with the second guide.\n\nOr, three tourists can be grouped with the first guide, and the remaining three tourists can be grouped with the second guide.\n\nTherefore, the number of different groupings of guides and tourists is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first guide can take any combination of tourists except all the tourists or none of the tourists. Therefore the number of possibilities is \\[\n\\binom{6}{1}+\\binom{6}{2}+\\binom{6}{3}+\\binom{6}{4}+\\binom{6}{5}=6+15+20+15+6=62.\n\\] OR\n\nIf each guide did not need to take at least one tourist, then each tourist could choose one of the two guides independently. In this case there would be $2^6=64$ possible arrangements. The two arrangements for which all tourists choose the same guide must be excluded, leaving a total of $64-2=\\boxed{62}$ possible arrangements."
