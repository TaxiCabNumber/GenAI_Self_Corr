At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION:**\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number on a single die is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling an odd number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe probability of rolling two even numbers and three odd numbers is:\n\n$$\\binom{5}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{5} = \\frac{5}{32}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{32}}\\).

        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers.
