At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected number of times Bob will roll his die?",
        "inference": "The probability of rolling a composite number is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$. The probability of rolling a prime number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of rolling a 1 is $\\frac{1}{6}$. If Bob rolls a 1, then he rolls again. So the expected number of times Bob will roll his die is,\n\n$$1\\cdot\\frac{2}{3} + 1\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} + 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{3}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{3}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the expected value of the number of times Bob rolls his die on a single day be $E$. When Bob rolls his die, there is a $\\frac{5}{6}$ chance that he will stop rolling after one roll, and a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he will have to start over. In the second case, since his first roll had no effect on the outcome, Bob will on average roll his die $E$ more times, for a total of $1+E$ times that day. Therefore, we know that $E=\\frac{5}{6}(1)+\\frac{1}{6}(1+E)$, or that $E=\\frac{6}{5}$. Over 365 days, Bob will roll his die an average of $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot365=\\boxed{438}$ times total."
