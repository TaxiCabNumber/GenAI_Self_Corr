At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fair 6-sided die is rolled.  If the roll is even, then you win that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if you roll 4, then you win $\\$4$).  If the roll is odd, you win nothing.  What is the expected value of your winnings? Express your answer as a dollar value.",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the probability of winning.**\n\nThe probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\n**Step 2: Find the expected value of the winnings.**\n\nThe expected value of the winnings is the probability of winning times the amount of the winnings. In this case, the probability of winning is 1/2 and the amount of the winnings is the number rolled, which can be 2, 4, or 6. So the expected value is:\n\n```\nEV = (1/2) * (2 + 4 + 6) = 1/2 * 12 = 6\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{6}$$. I hope it is correct.**",
