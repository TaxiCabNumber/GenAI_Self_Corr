At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJames has 7 apples. 4 of them are red, and 3 of them are green. If he chooses 2 apples at random, what is the probability that both the apples he chooses are green?",
        "inference": "To calculate the probability of choosing two green apples, we need to first determine the total number of possible combinations of choosing any two apples from the 7 apples. This can be calculated using combinations, which is given by the formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (n-r)! * r!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.\n\nIn this case, n = 7 and r = 2, so the total number of possible combinations is:\n\nC(7, 2) = 7! / (7-2)! * 2! = 21\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of combinations where both apples are green. There are 3 green apples out of the 7 apples, so the number of combinations of choosing 2 green apples is:\n\nC(3, 2) = 3! / (3-2)! * 2! = 3\n\nTherefore, the probability of choosing two green apples is:\n\nProbability = (Number of combinations with 2 green apples) / (Total number of possible combinations)\n= 3 / 21\n= 1 / 7\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1 / 7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total ways for James to choose 2 apples from 7, but only $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways for him to choose 2 green apples. So, the probability that he chooses 2 green apples is $\\frac{3}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$."
