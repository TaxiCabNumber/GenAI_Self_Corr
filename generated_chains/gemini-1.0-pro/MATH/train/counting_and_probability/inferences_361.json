        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a set of 1000 switches, each of which has four positions, called $A, B, C$, and $D$. When the position of any switch changes, it is only from $A$ to $B$, from $B$ to $C$, from $C$ to $D$, or from $D$ to $A$. Initially each switch is in position $A$. The switches are labeled with the 1000 different integers $(2^{x})(3^{y})(5^{z})$, where $x, y$, and $z$ take on the values $0, 1, \\ldots, 9$. At step i of a 1000-step process, the $i$-th switch is advanced one step, and so are all the other switches whose labels divide the label on the $i$-th switch. After step 1000 has been completed, how many switches will be in position $A$?\n",
        "inference": "At step $1$, the labels that advance are $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 30, \\ldots$. So they are all the labels divisible by $1, 2, 3$, or $5$. So at least $1000 - 252 = 748$ switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $2$, the labels that advance are divisible by $2$. So at least $252 - 126 = 126$ more switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $3$, the labels that advance are divisible by $3$. So at least $126 - 63 = 63$ more switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $4$, the labels that advance are divisible by $2^2 = 4$. So at least $42 - 21 = 21$ more switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $5$, the labels that advance are divisible by $5$. So at least $21 - 10 = 11$ more switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $6$, the labels that advance are divisible by $2 \\times 3 = 6$. So at least $11 - 6 = 5$ more switches are in position $A$.\nAt step $7$, the labels that advance are divisible by $7$. So at least $5 - 4 = 1$ more switch is in position $A$.\nSo finally, the number of switches in position $A$ is at least $748 + 126 + 63 + 21 + 11 + 5 + 1 = 975$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$975$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For each $i$th switch (designated by $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$), it advances itself only one time at the $i$th step; thereafter, only a switch with larger $x_{j},y_{j},z_{j}$ values will advance the $i$th switch by one step provided $d_{i}= 2^{x_{i}}3^{y_{i}}5^{z_{i}}$ divides $d_{j}= 2^{x_{j}}3^{y_{j}}5^{z_{j}}$. Let $N = 2^{9}3^{9}5^{9}$ be the max switch label. To find the divisor multiples in the range of $d_{i}$ to $N$, we consider the exponents of the number $\\frac{N}{d_{i}}= 2^{9-x_{i}}3^{9-y_{i}}5^{9-z_{i}}$. In general, the divisor-count of $\\frac{N}{d}$ must be a multiple of 4 to ensure that a switch is in position A:\n$4n = [(9-x)+1] [(9-y)+1] [(9-z)+1] = (10-x)(10-y)(10-z)$, where $0 \\le x,y,z \\le 9.$\nWe consider the cases where the 3 factors above do not contribute multiples of 4.\nCase of no 2's:\nThe switches must be $(\\mathrm{odd})(\\mathrm{odd})(\\mathrm{odd})$.
