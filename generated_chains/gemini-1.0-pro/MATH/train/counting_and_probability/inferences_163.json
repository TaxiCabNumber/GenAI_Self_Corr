        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lottery in our state consists of two drawings.  First, a MegaBall is picked from among 27 numbered balls.  Second, five WinnerBalls are picked from among 44 numbered balls. To win the lottery, you must pick the MegaBall number correctly and also pick the numbers on the five WinnerBalls (but you don't need to get the order right for the WinnerBalls).  What is the probability that the ticket I hold has the winning numbers?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the probability of choosing the correct MegaBall number.  There are 27 possible numbers, so the probability of choosing the correct one is 1/27.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability of choosing the correct five WinnerBall numbers.  There are 44 possible numbers, so the probability of choosing the correct one for the first WinnerBall is 1/44.  The probability of choosing the correct number for the second WinnerBall is 1/43, since there will be 43 numbers remaining in the pool of numbers once the number for the first WinnerBall has been drawn.  The probability of choosing the correct number for the third WinnerBall is 1/42, and so on.\n\nSo, the probability of choosing the correct numbers for all five WinnerBalls is:\n\n```\n(1/44) * (1/43) * (1/42) * (1/41) * (1/40) = 1/3,477,152\n```\n\nFinally, we need to find the probability of choosing the correct MegaBall number and the correct five WinnerBall numbers.  This is the probability of two independent events occurring, so we can multiply the probabilities of each event:\n\n```\n(1/27) * (1/3,477,152) = 1/94,054,872\n```\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1 / 94,054,872}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the MegaBall matches is $\\dfrac{1}{27}$ . The probability that the 5 WinnerBalls match is $\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}$. So my chances of winning are $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{27}\\right)\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}\\right) = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{29,\\!322,\\!216}}$."
