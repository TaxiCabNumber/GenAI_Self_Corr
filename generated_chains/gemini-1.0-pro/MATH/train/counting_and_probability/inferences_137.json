At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
        "inference": "There are 50 integers between 20 and 69, inclusive.  Out of those, there are 10 options for the ones digit and 5 options for the tens digit.  \nThe probability of selecting an integer with a particular ones digit is 1/10.  \nThe probability of selecting an integer with a particular tens digit after an integer with a particular ones digit has already been selected is 1/9.  \nThe probability of selecting 5 integers with different tens digits is  \n$$\\frac{1}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{30240}$$  \nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1/30240$}.

        "ground_truth": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$"
