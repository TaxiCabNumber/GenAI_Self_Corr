At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil rolls 6 fair 6-sided dice. What is the probability that at least two dice show the same number?",
        "inference": "* There are 6 possible outcomes for each die.\n* There are 6^6 = 46,656 possible outcomes for 6 dice.\n* There are 6 ways to get all 6 dice to show the same number (111111, 222222, 333333, 444444, 555555, and 666666).\n* There are 30 ways to get 5 dice to show the same number and 1 die to show a different number.\n* There are 120 ways to get 4 dice to show the same number and 2 dice to show different numbers.\n* There are 360 ways to get 3 dice to show the same number and 3 dice to show different numbers.\n* There are 720 ways to get 2 dice to show the same number and 4 dice to show different numbers.\n* So, there are 6 + 30 + 120 + 360 + 720 = 1,236 ways to get at least two dice to show the same number.\n* Therefore, the probability that at least two dice show the same number is 1,236 / 46,656 = 1/38.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/38}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$."
