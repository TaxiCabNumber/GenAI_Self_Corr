At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many triangles with positive area have all their vertices at points $(i,j)$ in the coordinate plane, where $i$ and $j$ are integers between $1$ and $5$, inclusive?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2128 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 2148 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2160 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 2200 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2300$\n",
        "inference": "We can use a combination to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, we can choose any three of the $5^2=25$ points to be the vertices of a triangle. There are ${25 \\choose 3}=2300$ ways to do this.\n\nNow, we need to consider that the triangle may not have positive area. If the points are collinear, then the triangle will have zero area. There are ${5 \\choose 2}=10$ ways to choose two points to be collinear. For each of these pairs of points, there are 3 ways to choose the third point. So, there are $10 \\times 3=30$ triangles with zero area.\n\nTherefore, the number of triangles with positive area is $2300-30=\\boxed{2270}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2270}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this by finding all the combinations, then subtracting the ones that are on the same line. There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$, so $\\dbinom{25}3$ is $\\frac{25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}$, which simplifies to $2300$. Now we count the ones that are on the same line. We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\\dbinom53$ is $10$, and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$. We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal. That is $\\dbinom43$, which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$. We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$. We can also count the ones with a slope of $\\frac12$, $2$, $-\\frac12$, or $-2$, with $3$ points in each. There are $12$ of them, so that results in $12$. Finally, we subtract all the ones in a line from $2300$, so we have $2300-120-16-4-12=\\boxed{2148}$."
