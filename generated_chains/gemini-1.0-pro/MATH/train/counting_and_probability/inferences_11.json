At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe probability of drawing a Jack on the first draw is 4/52. The probability of drawing a Queen on the second draw is 3/51. The probability of drawing a King on the third draw is 2/50.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a Jack, a Queen, and a King in that order is:\n\n(4/52) * (3/51) * (2/50) = 1/22100\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1/22100$}.
