At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nForty slips are placed into a hat, each bearing a number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, with each number entered on four slips. Four slips are drawn from the hat at random and without replacement. Let $p$ be the probability that all four slips bear the same number. Let $q$ be the probability that two of the slips bear a number $a$ and the other two bear a number $b\\ne a$. What is the value of $q/p$?",
        "inference": "When all four slips bear the same number, there are $10$ numbers that can be drawn, so there are $10$ ways to choose the number. There are $4!$ ways to order the $4$ slips, so there are $10\\cdot4!=240$ ways to draw $4$ slips with the same number.  When two of the slips bear a number $a$ and the other two bear a number $b\\ne a$, there are $\\binom{10}{1}$ ways to choose $a$ and $\\binom{9}{1}$ ways to choose $b$. There are $4!$ ways to order the $4$ slips, so there are $\\binom{10}{1}\\binom{9}{1}4!=12,960$ ways to draw $4$ slips with two of them bearing the number $a$ and the other two bearing the number $b$.  Therefore, $q/p=\\frac{12,960}{240}=\\boxed{54}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The total number of ways that the numbers can be chosen is $\n\\binom{40}{4}.\n$ Exactly 10 of these possibilities result in the four slips having the same number.\n\nNow we need to determine the number of ways that two slips can have a number $a$ and the other two slips have a number $b$, with $b\\ne a$.

For each value of $a$, there are $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose the two slips with $a$ and for  each value of $b$, there are $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose the two slips with $b$.
