At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B.$ The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nTeam $A$ will win against team $B$ in the first game, so team $A$ will have at least 1 point. Team $B$ will lose against team $A$ in the first game, so team $B$ will have at most 0 points. Therefore, team $A$ will finish with more points than team $B$ if team $A$ wins at least one more game than team $B$. There are 6 other games, so team $A$ will finish with more points than team $B$ if team $A$ wins at least 2 games.\n\nTherefore, the probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is the same as the probability that team $A$ wins at least 2 of the other 6 games. This is equal to\n\n$$1-\\binom{6}{0}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6-\\binom{6}{1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6=\\frac{63}{64}.$$\n\nTherefore, $m/n=63/64$, so $m=63$ and $n=64$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{127}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The results of the five remaining games are independent of the first game, so by symmetry, the probability that $A$ scores higher than $B$ in these five games is equal to the probability that $B$ scores higher than $A$. We let this probability be $p$; then the probability that $A$ and $B$ end with the same score in these five games is $1-2p$.\nOf these three cases ($|A| > |B|, |A| < |B|, |A|=|B|$), the last is the easiest to calculate (see solution 2 for a way to directly calculate the other cases).\nThere are ${5\\choose k}$ ways to $A$ to have $k$ victories, and ${5\\choose k}$ ways for $B$ to have $k$ victories. Summing for all values of $k$,\n$1-2p = \\frac{1}{2^{5} \\times 2^{5}}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{5} {5\\choose k}^2\\right) = \\frac{1^2+5^2+10^2+10^2+5^2+1^2}{1024} = \\frac{126}{512}.$\nThus $p = \\frac 12 \\left(1-\\frac{126}{512}\\right) = \\frac{193}{512}$. The desired probability is the sum of the cases when $|A| \\ge |B|$, so the answer is $\\frac{126}{512} + \\frac{193}{512} = \\frac{319}{512}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{831}$."
