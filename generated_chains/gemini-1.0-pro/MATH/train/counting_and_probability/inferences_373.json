In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit number and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age. Let $d$ be Dick's present age. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?\n",
        "inference": "Let's assume that Dick's current age is $d$. If $n$ is the number of years in the future when their ages both become two-digit numbers and Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age, then the system of equations we need to solve is: $$\\begin{align} d+n &= 10x+y, \\\\\\ d+n+10 &= 10y+x, \\end{align}$$where $x$ and $y$ are the digits in Jane's age, and $y$ and $x$ are the digits in Dick's age. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $$\\begin{split} d+n+10-(d+n) & = 10y+x-(10x+y), \\\\\\ 10 & = 9y-9x, \\\\\\ 10 & = 9(y-x). \\end{split}$$Since $9$ is prime, we must have $y-x=1$, or $y=x+1$. Thus, Jane's age is $10x+x+1=11x+1$. Since $11x+1$ is a two-digit number, we must have $0 \\leq 11x+1 \\leq 99$, which implies that $0 \\leq 11x \\leq 98$, and $0 \\leq x \\leq 8$. The only possible values of $x$ are $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$. \n\nFor each of these values of $x$, we can find the corresponding value of $y$ and then solve for $n$ and $d$.\n\n**Case 1**: If $x=1$, then $y=2$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=13$. Thus, $n=13-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=13-n=13-25=-12$, which is not a positive integer. Therefore, there are no ordered pairs $(d,n)$ for this case.\n\n**Case 2**: If $x=2$, then $y=3$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=23$. Thus, $n=23-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=23-n=23-25=-2$, which is not a positive integer. Therefore, there are no ordered pairs $(d,n)$ for this case.\n\n**Case 3**: If $x=3$, then $y=4$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=34$. Thus, $n=34-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=34-n=34-25=9$. Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(9,34)$.\n\n**Case 4**: If $x=4$, then $y=5$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=45$. Thus, $n=45-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=45-n=45-25=20$. Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(20,45)$.\n\n**Case 5**: If $x=5$, then $y=6$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=56$. Thus, $n=56-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=56-n=56-25=31$. Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(31,56)$.\n\n**Case 6**: If $x=6$, then $y=7$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=67$. Thus, $n=67-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=67-n=67-25=42$. Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(42,67)$.\n\n**Case 7**: If $x=7$, then $y=8$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=78$. Thus, $n=78-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=78-n=78-25=53$. Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(53,78)$.\n\n**Case 8**: If $x=8$, then $y=9$ and $Jane's$ age is $11x+1=89$. Thus, $n=89-d$. Since $Jane$ is $25$ years old, we have $d=89-n=89-25=64.$ Thus, one ordered pair $(d,n)$ is $(64,89)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.",
