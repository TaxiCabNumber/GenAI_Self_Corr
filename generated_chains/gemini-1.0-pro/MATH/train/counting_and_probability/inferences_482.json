        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBag A has 3 white marbles and 4 black marbles.  Bag B has 6 yellow marbles and 4 blue marbles.  Bag C has 2 yellow marbles and 5 blue marbles.  A marble is drawn at random from Bag A.  If it is white, a marble is drawn at random from Bag B, otherwise, if it is black, a marble is drawn at random from Bag C.  What is the probability that the second marble drawn is yellow?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nProbability of drawing a white marble from Bag A = 3/7\nProbability of drawing a black marble from Bag A = 4/7\nProbability of drawing a yellow marble from Bag B = 6/10 = 3/5\nProbability of drawing a blue marble from Bag B = 4/10 = 2/5\nProbability of drawing a yellow marble from Bag C = 2/7\nProbability of drawing a blue marble from Bag C = 5/7\nProbability of drawing a white marble from Bag A and then a yellow marble from Bag B = (3/7) * (3/5) = 9/35\nProbability of drawing a black marble from Bag A and then a yellow marble from Bag C = (4/7) * (2/7) = 8/49\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a yellow marble as the second marble = 9/35 + 8/49 = 461/735\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{461}{735}$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can get the second marble to be yellow in two ways:  either a white from A (with probability 3/7) then a yellow from B (with probability 6/10), or a black from A (with probability 4/7) then a yellow from C (with probability 2/7). Thus, the probability is \\[ \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\times\\frac{6}{10}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\times\\frac{2}{7}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{103}{245}}.\\]"
