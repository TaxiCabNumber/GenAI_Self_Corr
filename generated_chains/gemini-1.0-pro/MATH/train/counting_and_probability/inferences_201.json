At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many two-digit numbers are there in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit?",
        "inference": "These numbers will be in the range of 10 to 99 inclusive. For the tens digit, there are 9 choices (1 to 9). For each of these choices, there are 9 choices for the ones digit (0 to 8 since it must be less than the tens digit).\nSo, the total number of two-digit numbers in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit is:\n9 x 9 = 81.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{81}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In addition to two-digit numbers, consider the one-digit numbers $01$ through $09.$ Of these $99$ numbers, $9$ have repeated digits $01,$ $02,$ $03,$ $\\ldots,$ $99,$ namely: $11,$ $22,$ $33,$ $\\ldots,$ and $99.$ Of the remaining $90$ numbers, each one has a unique counterpart formed by swapping their tens and units digit. Thus among these, $45$ have a tens digit greater than the units digit. (The other $45$ have a tens digit smaller than the units digit.) The required answer is $\\boxed{45}.$"
