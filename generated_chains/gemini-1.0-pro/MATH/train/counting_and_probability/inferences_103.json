At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles.  Two marbles are drawn from the bag and not replaced.  What is the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of drawing a red marble first.\n\nThere are 3 red marbles in the bag of 8 marbles. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red marble first is 3/8.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability of drawing a white marble second, given that a red marble was drawn first.\n\nAfter drawing a red marble, there are 2 red marbles and 5 white marbles left in the bag of 7 marbles. Therefore, the probability of drawing a white marble second, given that a red marble was drawn first, is 5/7.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the probabilities from Steps 1 and 2 to find the overall probability.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red marble first and a white marble second is (3/8) * (5/7) = 15/56.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{15}{56}$} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the first is red is $\\dfrac38$.  Now with 7 remaining, the probability that the second is white is $\\dfrac57$. The answer is $\\dfrac38 \\times \\dfrac57 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{56}}$."
