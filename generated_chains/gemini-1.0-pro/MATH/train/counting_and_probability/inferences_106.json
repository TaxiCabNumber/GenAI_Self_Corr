At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle?",

The smallest three-digit number in Pascal's triangle is the first three-digit number in the triangle.\n3. The first three-digit number in the triangle is $100$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
