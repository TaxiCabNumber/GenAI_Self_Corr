In 5C5 ways.\nThen choose 6 letters from A, A, B, B, B for the last 6 positions. In 6C6 ways.\nSo we have 6C4 * 5C5 * 6C6 permutations.\nNow, 6C4 = 15, 5C5 = 1, 6C6 = 1\nSo, 15 * 1 * 1 = 15\nThus, N = 15\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}.$ I hope it is correct.",

Also, there are $5-k$ Cs amongst the middle five numbers, and so there are $6-(5-k) = k+1$ Cs amongst the first four numbers.\nThus, there are ${4 \\choose k+1}$ ways to arrange the first four numbers, ${5 \\choose k}$ ways to arrange the middle five numbers, and ${6 \\choose 4-k} = {6\\choose k+2}$ ways to arrange the last six numbers. Notice that $k=4$ leads to a contradiction, so the desired sum is\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{3} {4\\choose k+1}{5\\choose k}{6\\choose k+2} = 60 + 600 + 600 + 60 = 1320\\]And $N \\equiv \\boxed{320} \\pmod{1000}$."
