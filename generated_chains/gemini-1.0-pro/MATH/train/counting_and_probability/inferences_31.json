        "ground_truth": "There are 8 digits upon which the die can land in the first roll and 8 digits upon which the die can land in the second roll. Thus, there are $8 \\cdot 8 = 64 $ pairs of digits that can result from two rolls. Of these, only two will produce a sum of 15: 8 and 7 or 7 and 8. Thus, the probability of rolling a 15 is $\\frac{2}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$."
