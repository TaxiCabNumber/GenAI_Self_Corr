At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$?",

Therefore, there are 5 different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "It is clear that the maximal positive difference is $6 - 1 = 5$. Moreover, we can use 6 to ensure that we can get all positive integer differences up to 5: $6 - 5 = 1$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $6 - 3 = 3$, $6 - 2 = 4$, $6 - 1 = 5$. So, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible differences."
