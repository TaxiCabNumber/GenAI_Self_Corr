        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA biologist wants to calculate the number of fish in a lake. On May 1 she catches a random sample of 60 fish, tags them, and releases them. On September 1 she catches a random sample of 70 fish and finds that 3 of them are tagged. To calculate the number of fish in the lake on May 1, she assumes that 25% of these fish are no longer in the lake on September 1 (because of death and emigrations), that 40% of the fish were not in the lake May 1 (because of births and immigrations), and that the number of untagged fish and tagged fish in the September 1 sample are representative of the total population. What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?\n",
        "inference": "Since 25% of the fish tagged in May are no longer in the lake in September, out of the 60 fish tagged in May, 45 fish are still there in September.\n\nSince 40% of the fish in the lake in September were not there in May, out of the 70 fish in the September sample, 42 were not there in May.\n\nSince 3 of the 70 fish in the September sample were tagged, the total number of tagged fish in the lake in September is $$70\\cdot\\frac3{70}=3.$$\n\nThen, the number of fish in the lake in May is $$\\frac{45}{3}\\cdot(42+45)=\\boxed{1575}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1575}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the $70$ fish caught in September, $40\\%$ were not there in May, so $42$ fish were there in May. Since the percentage of tagged fish in September is proportional to the percentage of tagged fish in May, $\\frac{3}{42} = \\frac{60}{x} \\Longrightarrow \\boxed{840}$."
