There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$. Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals.

We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals."
