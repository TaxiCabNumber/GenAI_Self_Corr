At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
        "inference": "Since the balls are indistinguishable and so are the boxes, all we have to do is choose which boxes will get the balls, which is equivalent to placing 3 dividers in a row of 7, one for each box. Therefore, the number of ways to do this is:\n\n$$_{7}C_3=\\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!}=\\frac{7!}{3!4!}=\\frac{7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=35.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$35$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we only need to consider the number of the balls in boxes without considering order.  The arrangements are (4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1), for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ ways."
