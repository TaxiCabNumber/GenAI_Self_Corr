At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil has 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in a bag. He removes a marble at random, records the color, puts it back, and then repeats this process until he has withdrawn 6 marbles. What is the probability that exactly three of the marbles that he removes are green? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of possible outcomes.\nThere are 10 marbles in the bag, so there are 10 possible outcomes for each draw. Since there are 6 draws, the total number of possible outcomes is 10^6 = 1,000,000.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of ways to get exactly 3 green marbles.\nThere are 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in the bag, so there are 7 choose 3 = 35 ways to get exactly 3 green marbles.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the probability of getting exactly 3 green marbles.\nThe probability of getting exactly 3 green marbles is the number of ways to get exactly 3 green marbles divided by the total number of possible outcomes: 35 / 1,000,000 = 0.000035.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{0.000}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\left( \\frac{7}{10} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{3}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{9261}{1000000}$ probability that 3 particular marbles out of 6 will be green and the rest will be purple. There are also  $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones. Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \\cdot \\frac{9261}{1000000}\\approx \\boxed{.185}$."
