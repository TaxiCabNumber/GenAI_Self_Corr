        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of the same gender?  Assume no one can hold both offices.",
        "inference": "First, we choose a president.  There are 10 boys and 10 girls in the club, so there are 10 + 10 = 20 choices for president.  Once a president has been chosen, there are 9 boys or 9 girls left, so there are 9 choices for vice-president.  Therefore, there are 20 * 9 = 180 ways to choose a president and a vice-president of the same gender.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{180}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 9 remaining members of the same sex. The answer is $20\\times 9=\\boxed{180}$."
