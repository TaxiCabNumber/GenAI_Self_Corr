At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $\\frac47$. Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
