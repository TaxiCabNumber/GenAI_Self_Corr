        "inference": "The table is an example of Pascal's triangle. In each row, the integer in column $k$ is the sum of the integers in columns $k-1$ and $k$ in the previous row. For example, in row 3, the integer in column 4, which is 13, is the sum of the integers in columns 3 and 4 in row 2, which are 7 and 6.\n\nTo find in what column the integer 800 will be written, we need to find the row in which the integer 800 appears. We can do this by using the formula for the $(n+1)^{th}$ row of Pascal's triangle:\n\n$${n+1 \\choose k} = \\frac{(n+1)!}{k!(n+1-k)!}$$\n\nwhere ${n+1 \\choose k}$ is the integer in column $k$ of the $(n+1)^{th}$ row of the triangle.\n\nWe want to find the value of $n$ for which ${n+1 \\choose k} = 800$. We can solve this equation for $n$ by using the following steps:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}{n+1 \\choose k} &= 800\\\\ \\frac{(n+1)!}{k!(n+1-k)!} &= 800\\\\ (n+1)(n) &= 800\\cdot k(n+1-k)\\\\ n^2+n &= 800k(n+1-k)\\\\ n^2+n &= 800k(n-k)\\\\ n^2+n-800kn &= 0\\\\ n^2-160kn+160n &= 0\\\\ (n-160)(n-10) &= 0\\\\ n &= 160, 10\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer greater than 1, the only possible value of $n$ is $n = 10$. This means that the integer 800 will be written in the $11^{th}$ row of Pascal's triangle, in the $5^{th}$ column if we continue the pattern. Therefore, the integer 800 will be written in column $E$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{E}.$ I hope it is correct.",
