        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlbert starts to make a list, in increasing order, of the positive integers that have a first digit of 1. He writes $1, 10, 11, 12, \\ldots$ but by the 1,000th digit he (finally) realizes that the list would contain an infinite number of elements. Find the three-digit number formed by the last three digits he wrote (the 998th, 999th, and 1000th digits, in that order).\n",
        "inference": "He wrote $1, 10, 11, 12, \\ldots$. The first digit is 1 and the other two digits are increasing. So, the $998$th digit is $198$, the $999$th is $199$, and the $1000$th is $200$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{198199200}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "It is clear that his list begins with 1 one-digit integer, 10 two-digits integers, and 100 three-digit integers, making a total of $321$ digits.\nSo he needs another $1000-321=679$ digits before he stops. He can accomplish this by writing 169 four-digit numbers for a total of $321+4(169)=997$ digits. The last of these 169 four-digit numbers is 1168, so the next three digits will be $\\boxed{116}$."
