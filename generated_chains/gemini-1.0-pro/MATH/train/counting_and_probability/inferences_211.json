At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, what is the fourth number?",
        "inference": "The fourth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12 is 44.\n\n1. The first number in the row is always 1.\n\n2. The second number in the row is always the same as the first number.\n\n3. The third number in the row is always the sum of the first two numbers.\n\n4. The fourth number in the row is always the sum of the second and third numbers.\n\n5. The fifth number in the row is always the sum of the third and fourth numbers.\n\n6. And so on.\n\nSo, the fourth number in the row that starts with 1 and then 12 is the sum of the second and third numbers, which are 12 and 66, respectively. Therefore, the fourth number is 12 + 66 = 78.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$. I hope it is correct.",
