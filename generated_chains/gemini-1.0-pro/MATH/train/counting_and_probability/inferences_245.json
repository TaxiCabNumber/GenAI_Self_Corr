At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?",
        "inference": "Let \\( p \\), \\( n \\), and \\(d \\) be the number of pennies, nickels and dimes, respectively. Then we have the equations:\n\n$$p + 5n + 10d = 25$$ \n\n$$p, n, d \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$$\n\nWe can rewrite the first equation as:\n\n$$p = 25 - 5n - 10d$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$25 - 5n - 10d + 5n + 10d \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$$\n\n$$25 \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$$\n\nTherefore, the number of combinations is infinite.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\infty}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations."
