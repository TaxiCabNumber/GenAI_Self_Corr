At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The number of multiples of 3 between 1000 and 9999 is (9999 - 1002) / 3 + 1 = 3000.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3000}$. I hope it is correct.",

From 334 to 3333, inclusive, there are $3333-334+1 = 3000$ positive integers.  So, there are $\\boxed{3000}$ positive integers that are multiples of 3.  Notice that this happens to equal $9000/3$.  Is this a coincidence?  (Beware of always using this reasoning!  What if we asked for the number of multiples of 7?)"
