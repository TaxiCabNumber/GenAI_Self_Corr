At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box contains 4 white balls and 4 black balls.  I draw them out of the box, one at a time.  What is the probability that all of my draws alternate colors?",
        "inference": "After the first draw, there are 7 balls left in the box.  If the first ball is white, there are 3 white balls and 4 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a black ball is 4/7.  If the first ball is black, there are 4 white balls and 3 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a white ball is 4/7.\n\nAfter the second draw, there are 6 balls left in the box.  If the first two balls are white and black, there are 3 white balls and 3 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a white ball is 3/6 = 1/2.  If the first two balls are black and white, there are 3 white balls and 3 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a black ball is 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nAfter the third draw, there are 5 balls left in the box.  If the first three balls are white, black, and white, there are 2 white balls and 3 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a black ball is 3/5.  If the first three balls are black, white, and black, there are 3 white balls and 2 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a white ball is 3/5.\n\nAfter the fourth draw, there are 4 balls left in the box.  If the first four balls are white, black, white, and black, there are 2 white balls and 2 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a white ball is 2/4 = 1/2.  If the first four balls are black, white, black, and white, there are 2 white balls and 2 black balls left, so the probability of drawing a black ball is 2/4 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of drawing all four balls in alternating colors is 4/7 * 4/7 * 3/6 * 3/5 * 2/4 = 96/1197 = 0.0802.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.0802}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $B$ denote drawing a black ball and $W$ denote drawing a white ball.\n\nThere are two possible successful orders: $BWBWBWBW$ or $WBWBWBWB.$\n\nThere are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to arrange four $B$'s and four $W$'s, so the probability that a random arrangement is successful is $\\dfrac{2}{70} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{35}}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe could also compute this based on the probabilities at each step that we draw a ball of the opposite color.
