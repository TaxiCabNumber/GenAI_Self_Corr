At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and on region $B$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$.  What is the probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Since the three regions are the only regions on the spinner, the sum of the probabilities of the arrow stopping on each region must be $1$.  Therefore,\n\n$$P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1$$\n\nSubstituting the given values,\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5} + P(C) = 1$$\n\nSolving for $P(C)$,\n\n$$P(C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{5}$$\n\n$$P(C) = 1 - \\frac{5}{10} - \\frac{2}{10}$$\n\n$$P(C) = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{7}{10}$$\n\n$$P(C) = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.
