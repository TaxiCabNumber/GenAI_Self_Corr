At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nErika, who is 14 years old, flips a fair coin whose sides are labeled 10 and 20, and then she adds the number on the top of the flipped coin to the number she rolls on a standard die. What is the probability that the sum equals her age in years? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only way for the sum to be a 14 is for her coin flip to be a 10 and for her roll to be a 4. This can only occur in $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
