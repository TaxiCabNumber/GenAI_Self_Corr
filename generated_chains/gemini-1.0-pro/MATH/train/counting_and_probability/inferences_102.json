At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

So, there are $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$ possible outcomes in total.\n\nThere are $6$ possible outcomes for each die, so there are $6^6 = 46656$ possible outcomes where all six dice show different numbers.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling six standard, six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers is $\\frac{46656}{720} = \\frac{66}{10} = \\frac{33}{5}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{33}{5}}.$ I hope it is correct.",

If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$."
