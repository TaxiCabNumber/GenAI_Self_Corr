At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag contains 10 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. Three marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and two are blue? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is $\\frac{10}{16}$. After one red marble is selected, there are 9 red marbles and 6 blue marbles left, so the probability of selecting two blue marbles on the second and third draws is $\\frac{6}{15} \\cdot \\frac{5}{14} = \\frac{1}{7}$. Therefore, the probability of selecting one red marble and two blue marbles is $\\frac{10}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{5}{112}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{112}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are three ways to draw two blue marbles and a red one: RBB, BRB, and  BBR. Since there are no overlapping outcomes, these are distinct cases and their sum is the total probability that two of the three drawn will be blue.  The desired probability therefore is  \\[\\frac{10}{16}\\cdot\\frac{6}{15}\\cdot\\frac{5}{14} + \\frac{6}{16}\\cdot\\frac{10}{15}\\cdot\\frac{5}{14} + \\frac{6}{16}\\cdot\\frac{5}{15}\\cdot\\frac{10}{14} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{56}}.\\]"
