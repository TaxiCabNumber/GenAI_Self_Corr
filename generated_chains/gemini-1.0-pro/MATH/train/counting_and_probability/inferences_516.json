At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNine people sit down at random seats around a round table. Four of them are math majors, three others are physics majors, and the two remaining people are biology majors. What is the probability that all four math majors sit in consecutive seats?",

There are 6! ways to arrange the remaining 5 people around the table. Once they are arranged, there are 4! ways to arrange the math majors within their group.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the probability.\n\nThe probability of all four math majors sitting in consecutive seats is the number of ways they can do so divided by the total number of ways the people can be seated.\n\n$$P = \\frac{6!\\cdot4!}{9!} = \\frac{1}{9\\cdot8} = \\frac{1}{72}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1/72$}.

        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{4}=126$ ways to choose the seats for the four math majors. Of these ways, there are only 9 where the four math majors sit in consecutive seats. Therefore, the probability that the math majors sit in consecutive seats is $\\frac{9}{126}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}$."
