At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pet store has 15 puppies, 6 kittens, and 8 hamsters. Alice, Bob, and Charlie each want to buy a pet. For variety, they each want a different kind of pet. How many ways can Alice, Bob, and Charlie buy pets and leave the store satisfied?",
        "inference": "There are 15 choices for Alice, 6 choices for Bob, and 8 choices for Charlie.\n\nSo, the number of ways they can buy pets is = $15 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 720$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$720$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Ignoring who gets which pet for now, we can see that there are $15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8$ ways to choose one puppy, one kitten, and one hamster. Now, Alice has three choices for which type of pet she wants, Bob has two, and Charlie has one, due to the constraint that they must each have a different type of pet. Thus, there are $15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{4320}$ such ways."
