        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Reader has six different Spiderman comic books, five different Archie comic books and four different Garfield comic books. When stacked, all of the Spiderman comic books are grouped together, all of the Archie comic books are grouped together and all of the Garfield comic books are grouped together. In how many different orders can these 15 comic books be stacked in a pile with the covers facing up and all of them facing the same direction? Express your answer as a whole number.",
        "inference": "There are 3 groups of comic books, each with a different number of books. The number of ways to order the 3 groups is 3!. The number of ways to order the 6 Spiderman books is 6!. The number of ways to order the 5 Archie books is 5!. The number of ways to order the 4 Garfield books is 4!. So, the number of different orders is 3! * 6! * 5! * 4!.\n\n$$=3 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 24= 6,451,200$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6,451,200$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $6!=720$ ways to order the Spiderman comics, $5!=120$ ways to order the Archie ones, and $4!=24$ ways to order the Garfield books. This means that there are $720\\cdot120\\cdot24$ ways to order the books within their groups. Once we have done that, we need to place the 3 groups of comics in a stack. There are 3 options for which type of comics goes on the bottom, 2 options for which type goes in the middle, and 1 type of comic left which we put on top. This means that our final answer is $720\\cdot120\\cdot24\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1=\\boxed{12,\\!441,\\!600}$ ways in which to order all the comics."
