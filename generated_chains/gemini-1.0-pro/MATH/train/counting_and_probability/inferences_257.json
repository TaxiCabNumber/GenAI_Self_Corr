At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bowl contains 10 jellybeans (four red, one blue and five white). If you pick three jellybeans from the bowl at random and without replacement, what is the probability that exactly two will be red? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of ways to select three jellybeans from 10 jellybeans without replacement. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, C(n, r) = n! / (n - r)! / r! where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 10 and r = 3, so the total number of ways to select three jellybeans from 10 jellybeans without replacement is C(10, 3) = 10! / (10 - 3)! / 3! = 120.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of ways to select exactly two red jellybeans from the four red jellybeans. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, C(n, r) = n! / (n - r)! / r! where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 4 and r = 2, so the number of ways to select exactly two red jellybeans from the four red jellybeans is C(4, 2) = 4! / (4 - 2)! / 2! = 6.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the number of ways to select one non-red jellybean from the six non-red jellybeans. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations, C(n, r) = n! / (n - r)! / r! where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and r = 1, so the number of ways to select one non-red jellybean from the six non-red jellybeans is C(6, 1) = 6! / (6 - 1)! / 1! = 6.\n\n**Step 4:** Multiply the results from steps 2 and 3 to get the total number of ways to select exactly two red jellybeans and one non-red jellybean. This is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n**Step 5:** Divide the result from step 4 by the result from step 1 to get the probability of selecting exactly two red jellybeans from 10 jellybeans without replacement. This is 36 / 120 = 3 / 10.\n\n**Final Answer:  $\\\\boxed{3/10}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we consider how many total sets of three jellybeans we can select, which is very simply ${10 \\choose 3} = 120$, if we treat all 10 jellybeans as distinct. Now, if we have exactly 2 red jellybeans, there are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of red jellybeans, and $5+1 = 6$ choices for the third non-red jellybean. So, there are $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ successful outcomes. So our probability is $\\frac{6 \\cdot 6}{120} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$."
