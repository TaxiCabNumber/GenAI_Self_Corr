Then $n$ has the form $n=100a+10b+c$, where $a$ is the largest digit, $b$ is the middle digit, and $c$ is the smallest digit.\n\nIf some permutation of the digits of $n$ is a multiple of $11$, then $n$ itself is a multiple of $11$. This is because any permutation of the digits of $n$ can be obtained by multiplying $n$ by a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of three-digit integers between $100$ and $999$ that are multiples of $11$.\n\nThe first multiple of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ is $110$. The last multiple of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ is $990$.\n\nThere are $\\frac{990-110}{11}+1=81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 81 multiples of 11. Some have digits repeated twice, making 3 permutations.\nOthers that have no repeated digits have 6 permutations, but switching the hundreds and units digits also yield a multiple of 11. Therefore, assign 3 permutations to each multiple.\nThere are now 81*3 = 243 permutations, but we have overcounted*. Some multiples of 11 have a zero, and we must subtract a permutation for each.\nThere are 110, 220, 330 ... 990, yielding 9 extra permutations\nAlso, there are 209, 308, 407...902, yielding 8 more permutations.\nNow, just subtract these 17 from the total (243), getting $\\boxed{226}$."
