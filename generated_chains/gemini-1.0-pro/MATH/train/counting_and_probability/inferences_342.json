I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.\n",
        "inference": "If the probability of getting heads exactly once in five flips is $p$, then the probability of getting tails exactly four times is also $p$. If the probability of getting heads exactly twice in five flips is $p$, then the probability of getting tails exactly three times is also $p$. Therefore, the probability of getting heads exactly three times in five flips is $1-2p$. Thus, $$\\frac ij=1-2p$$\nSince $$\\frac ij$$ is in lowest terms, $i$ and $j$ are relatively prime. Thus, $i$ and $j$ cannot both be even. If $i$ is odd, then $j$ must be odd. If $j$ is odd, then $i$ must be odd. Therefore, $i$ and $j$ are both odd.\nSince $$\\frac ij$$ is in lowest terms, $i$ and $j$ do not have any common factors other than $1$. Therefore, $i$ and $j$ cannot both be multiples of $3$. If $i$ is a multiple of $3$, then $j$ must not be a multiple of $3$. If $j$ is a multiple of $3$, then $i$ must not be a multiple of $3$. Therefore, $i$ and $j$ are not both multiples of $3$.\nSince $$\\frac ij$$ is in lowest terms, $i$ and $j$ cannot both be multiples of $5$. If $i$ is a multiple of $5$, then $j$ must not be a multiple of $5$. If $j$ is a multiple of $5$, then $i$ must not be a multiple of $5$. Therefore, $i$ and $j$ are not both multiples of $5$.\nSince $i$ and $j$ are both odd, not both multiples of $3$, and not both multiples of $5$, the only possibility is that $i=1$ and $j=3$. Therefore, $$i+j=1+3=\\boxed{4}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
