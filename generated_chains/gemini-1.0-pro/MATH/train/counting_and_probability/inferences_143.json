At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe three-digit positive integer $N$ has a ones digit of 3. What is the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "All three-digit positive integers with a ones digit of 3 are of the form $100a+10b+3$. For $N$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. That is, $$a+b+3\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.$$\n\nThe only way for this to be true is if $a+b\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. There are six ways to do this: $a=0, b=2$; $a=1, b=1$; $a=1, b=4$; $a=2, b=0$; $a=2, b=3$; $a=4, b=1$. Thus, there are six three-digit positive integers with a ones digit of 3 that are divisible by 3: $1023, 1113, 1413, 2013, 2313, 4113$.\n\nThere are 900 three-digit positive integers with a ones digit of 3, so the probability that a randomly chosen three-digit positive integer with a ones digit of 3 is divisible by 3 is $$\\frac{6}{900} = \\frac{1}{150}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{150}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
