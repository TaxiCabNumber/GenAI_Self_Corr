        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Since there are $12$ gates arranged in a straight line, there are $11$ spaces between the gates. Let's name the gates as $G_1, G_2, G_3, ...,G_{12}$, and the spaces between them as $S_1, S_2, S_3, ...,S_{11}$. \n**Step 2**: If Dave walks to the left (towards $G_1$), he will walk $1100ft, 1000ft, 900ft... 200ft$.\n**Step 3**: If Dave walks to the right (towards $G_{12}$), he will walk $100ft, 200ft, 300ft... 1100ft$.\n**Step 4**: So, there are $6$ spaces to the left that Dave will walk $400ft$ or less, and $5$ spaces to the right.\n**Step 5**: Therefore, the probability that Dave walks $400ft$ or less to the new gate is $\\frac{6}{11}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $12 \\cdot 11 = 132$ possible situations ($12$ choices for the initially assigned gate, and $11$ choices for which gate Dave's flight was changed to). We are to count the situations in which the two gates are at most $400$ feet apart.\nIf we number the gates $1$ through $12$, then gates $1$ and $12$ have four other gates within $400$ feet, gates $2$ and $11$ have five, gates $3$ and $10$ have six, gates $4$ and $9$ have have seven, and gates $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$ have eight. Therefore, the number of valid gate assignments is\\[2\\cdot(4+5+6+7)+4\\cdot8 = 2 \\cdot 22 + 4 \\cdot 8 = 76\\]so the probability is $\\frac{76}{132} = \\frac{19}{33}$. The answer is $19 + 33 = \\boxed{52}$."
