At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "Calculate the number of ways to choose one triplet sister to be in the starting lineup: 3 ways.\nCalculate the number of ways to choose 5 players from the remaining 11 players: 462 ways (11 choose 5).\nMultiply the number of ways to choose one triplet sister by the number of ways to choose 5 players from the remaining 11 players: 3 x 462 = 1386 ways.\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{1386}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$."
