At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDefine an ordered quadruple of integers $(a, b, c, d)$ as interesting if $1 \\le a<b<c<d \\le 10$, and $a+d>b+c$. How many interesting ordered quadruples are there?\n",
        "inference": "There are $10$ choices for the value $a$, and for each choice of $a$, there are $9$ choices for $b$, $8$ choices for $c$, and $7$ choices for $d$.  Therefore, the total number of ordered quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ is $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7$.\n\nTo find the number of interesting ordered quadruples, we need to subtract the number of ordered quadruples that are not interesting.  This is equivalent to subtracting the number of ordered quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ such that $a+d \\le b+c$.  There are $10$ choices for the value $a$, and for each choice of $a$, there are $9$ choices for $b$, $8$ choices for $c$, and $6$ choices for $d$.  Therefore, the number of ordered quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ such that $a+d \\le b+c$ is $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6$.\n\nTherefore, the number of interesting ordered quadruples $(a, b, c, d)$ is $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 - 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 6 = 5040 - 4320 = 720$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$.

        "ground_truth": "Rearranging the inequality we get $d-c > b-a$. Let $e = 11$, then $(a, b-a, c-b, d-c, e-d)$ is a partition of 11 into 5 positive integers or equivalently: $(a-1, b-a-1, c-b-1, d-c-1, e-d-1)$ is a partition of 6 into 5 non-negative integer parts. Via a standard stars and bars argument, the number of ways to partition 6 into 5 non-negative parts is $\\binom{6+4}4 = \\binom{10}4 = 210$. The interesting quadruples correspond to partitions where the second number is less than the fourth. By symmetry, there are as many partitions where the fourth is less than the second. So, if $N$ is the number of partitions where the second element is equal to the fourth, our answer is $(210-N)/2$.\nWe find $N$ as a sum of 4 cases:\ntwo parts equal to zero, $\\binom82 = 28$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to one, $\\binom62 = 15$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to two, $\\binom42 = 6$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to three, $\\binom22 = 1$ way.\nTherefore, $N = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50$ and our answer is $(210 - 50)/2 = \\boxed{80}$."
