At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix green balls and four red balls are in a bag.  A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?",
        "inference": "1. Probability of selecting a green ball on the first draw: $6 / (6 + 4) = 6 / 10 = 3 / 5$\n2. Probability of selecting a green ball on the second draw, given that a green ball was selected on the first draw: $5 / (6 + 4) = 5 / 10 = 1 / 2$\n3. Probability of selecting a red ball on the first draw: $4 / (6 + 4) = 4 / 10 = 2 / 5$\n4. Probability of selecting a red ball on the second draw, given that a red ball was selected on the first draw: $3 / (6 + 4) = 3 / 10 = 3 / 5$\n5. Probability of selecting two green balls: $(3 / 5) * (1 / 2) = 3 / 10$\n6. Probability of selecting two red balls: $(2 / 5) * (3 / 5) = 6 / 25$\n7. Probability of selecting two balls of the same color: $3 / 10 + 6 / 25 = (15 + 6) / 25 = 21 / 25 = 0.84$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.84}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{4}{25}$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{9}{25} + \\dfrac{4}{25} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$."
