At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive, three-digit integers contain at least one $3$ as a digit but do not contain a $5$ as a digit?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** There are $10$ choices for the hundreds digit, excluding $0$ and $5$.\n**Step 2:** Since the integer must contain at least one $3$, there are $2$ choices for the tens digit: $3$ or a non-$3$ digit.\n**Step 3:** Since the integer cannot contain a $5$, there are $9$ choices for the units digit.\n**Step 4:** By the Multiplication Principle, the number of such integers is $10 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 9 = 180$.\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{180}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us consider the number of three-digit integers that do not contain $3$ and $5$ as digits; let this set be $S$. For any such number, there would be $7$ possible choices for the hundreds digit (excluding $0,3$, and $5$), and $8$ possible choices for each of the tens and ones digits. Thus, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 448$ three-digit integers without a $3$ or $5$.\n\nNow, we count the number of three-digit integers that just do not contain a $5$ as a digit; let this set be $T$. There would be $8$ possible choices for the hundreds digit, and $9$ for each of the others, giving $8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 648$. By the complementary principle, the set of three-digit integers with at least one $3$ and no $5$s is the number of integers in $T$ but not $S$. There are $648 - 448 = \\boxed{200}$ such numbers."
