At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four-member math team at Pecanridge Middle School is chosen from the math club, which has three girls and five boys. How many different teams made up of two girls and two boys could be chosen?",

This can be done using combinations: \n$$C(3, 2) = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3$$\n\nNext, find the number of ways to choose two boys from the five available. This can be done using combinations: \n$$C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$$\n\nFinally, multiply the number of ways to choose two girls by the number of ways to choose two boys to get the total number of different teams:\n\n$$3 \\times 10 = 30$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$30$}.
