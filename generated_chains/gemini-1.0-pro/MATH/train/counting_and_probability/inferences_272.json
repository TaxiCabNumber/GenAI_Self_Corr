        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 150 numbers in the bag.\n\n**Counting Perfect Squares:**\n- The first 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150 are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144\n- There are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150.\n\n**Counting Perfect Cubes:**\n- The first 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150 are: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125\n- There are 5 perfect cubes from 1 to 150.\n\n**Counting Perfect Squares and Perfect Cubes:**\n- We have counted 12 perfect squares and 5 perfect cubes.\n- However, we have double-counted 1 (which is both a perfect square and a perfect cube).\n- Therefore, there are 12 + 5 - 1 = 16 numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n\n**Counting Numbers Neither Perfect Squares Nor Perfect Cubes:**\n- There are 150 numbers in total.\n- There are 16 numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes.\n- Therefore, there are 150 - 16 = 134 numbers that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes.\n\n**Probability:**\n- The probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube is:\n    ```\n    Probability = (Number of neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes) / (Total number of numbers)\n    Probability = 134 / 150\n    Probability = 67 / 75\n    ```\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{67}{75}$}.

        "ground_truth": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$."
