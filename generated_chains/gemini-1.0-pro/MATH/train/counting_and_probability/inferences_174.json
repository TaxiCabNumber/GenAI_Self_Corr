        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Count the number of ways to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines.\nThere are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 horizontal lines, and 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 vertical lines. Therefore, there are 6 * 6 = 36 ways to choose 2 horizontal lines and 2 vertical lines.\n\n**Step 2:** Count the number of ways to arrange the 4 lines to form a rectangle.\nThere are 4! = 24 ways to arrange the 4 lines to form a rectangle.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of ways to choose the lines by the number of ways to arrange them.\nThere are 36 * 24 = 864 ways to choose 4 lines such that a rectangular region is enclosed.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{864}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle."
