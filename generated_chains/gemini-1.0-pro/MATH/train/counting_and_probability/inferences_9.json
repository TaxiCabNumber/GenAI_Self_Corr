At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn needs to catch a train. The train arrives randomly some time between 2:00 and 3:00, waits for 20 minutes, and then leaves. If John also arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00, what is the probability that the train will be there when John arrives?",
