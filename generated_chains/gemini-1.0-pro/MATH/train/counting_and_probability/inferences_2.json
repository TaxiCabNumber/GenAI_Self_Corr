Therefore, the total number of students who have at least one type of pet must be $16 + 12 + 6 + 5 = 39$. \nHowever, the Venn diagram shows that only 32 students have at least one type of pet.

Plugging that into the first equation, we find $y+z=4$.  From the third equation, we can then see, $w=0$.  Finally, from the second equation, we find $z=1$. Thus, there is $\\boxed{1}$ student with cats, dogs, and other pets."
