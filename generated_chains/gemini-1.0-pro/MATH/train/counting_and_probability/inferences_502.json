        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA license plate in a certain state consists of 4 digits, not necessarily distinct, and 2 letters, also not necessarily distinct. These six characters may appear in any order, except that the two letters must appear next to each other.  How many distinct license plates are possible?",
        "inference": "**1.** The 4 digits can be arranged in \\(4!=24\\) ways.\n\n**2.** The 2 letters can be arranged in \\(2!=2\\) ways, but they must appear next to each other, so there are \\(2\\) choices for their position among the \\(6\\) characters.\n\n**3.** The 6 characters can be arranged in \\(6!=720\\) ways, but we have already accounted for the arrangements of the digits and the letters, so we need to divide by \\(24\\cdot2\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct license plates is:\n\n$$24\\cdot2\\cdot720\\div24\\cdot2=720$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$720$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the two letters have to be next to each other, think of them as forming a two-letter word $w$. So each license plate consists of 4 digits and $w$. For each digit there are 10 choices. There are $26\\cdot 26$ choices for the letters of $w$, and  there are 5 choices for the position of $w$. So the total number of distinct license plates is $5\\cdot10^4\\cdot26^2 = \\boxed{33,\\!800,\\!000}$."
