        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways to select at least one apple.\nSince we can choose 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 apples, there are 6 ways to select at least one apple.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of ways to select at least one orange.\nSince we can choose 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 oranges, there are 11 ways to select at least one orange.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of ways to select at least one apple by the number of ways to select at least one orange.\n6 * 11 = 66\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$66$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets."
