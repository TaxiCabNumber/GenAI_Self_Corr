I hope it is correct.'\nBen rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1 to 20. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of rolling an even number on a single die.\n\nP(even) = 10/20 = 1/2\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability of rolling an odd number on a single die.\n\nP(odd) = 10/20 = 1/2\n\n**Step 3:** Find the probability of rolling exactly two even numbers on four dice.\n\nP(2 even) = (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 * 4C2\n= 1/16 * 6\n= 3/8\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{3}{8}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{16}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$."
