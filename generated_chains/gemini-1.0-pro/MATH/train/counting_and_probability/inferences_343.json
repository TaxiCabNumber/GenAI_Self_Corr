At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a shooting match, eight clay targets are arranged in two hanging columns of three targets each and one column of two targets. A marksman is to break all the targets according to the following rules:\n1) The marksman first chooses a column from which a target is to be broken.\n2) The marksman must then break the lowest remaining target in the chosen column.\nIf the rules are followed, in how many different orders can the eight targets be broken?\n",
        "inference": "There are 3 choices for the first target: the bottom target in any of the three columns. Once the first target is broken, there are 2 choices for the second target: the bottom target in either of the two columns that still have targets. Once the second target is broken, there is only 1 choice for the third target: the bottom target in the last column that still has targets. Thus, there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{6}$ different orders in which the eight targets can be broken.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the columns are labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. Consider the string $AAABBBCC$. Since the arrangements of the strings is bijective to the order of shooting, the answer is the number of ways to arrange the letters which is $\\frac{8!}{3! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{560}$."
