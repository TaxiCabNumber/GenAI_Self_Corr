At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
        "inference": "There are 4 ways to choose two white socks, 4 ways to choose two brown socks, and 1 way to choose two blue socks. So, there are a total of 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$9$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$."
