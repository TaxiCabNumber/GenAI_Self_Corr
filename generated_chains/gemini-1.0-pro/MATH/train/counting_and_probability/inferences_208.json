At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA play has two different male roles, two different female roles and two different roles that can be either gender. Only a man can be assigned to a male role, and only a woman can be assigned to a female role. If five men and six women audition, in how many ways can the six roles be assigned?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Calculate the number of ways to assign the male roles.\nThere are two male roles, and five men to choose from. So, there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways to assign the male roles.\n\n**Step 2**: Calculate the number of ways to assign the female roles.\nThere are two female roles, and six women to choose from. So, there are $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$ ways to assign the female roles.\n\n**Step 3**: Calculate the number of ways to assign the gender-neutral roles.\nThere are two gender-neutral roles, and five men and six women to choose from. So, there are $5 \\cdot 6 = 30$ ways to assign the gender-neutral roles.\n\n**Step 4**: Multiply the number of ways to assign each type of role to get the total number of ways to assign the six roles.\nThe total number of ways to assign the six roles is $20 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 30 = 18000$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{18000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We start with the most restrictive conditions: the roles that are not open to both men and women.  First, we will fill the two male roles. There are 5 men, so there are $5 \\cdot 4= 20$ ways to assign 2 of the 5 men to the distinct male roles. Doing the same for the female roles, there are $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$ ways. Finally, of the $5+6 - 2 - 2 = 7$ remaining actors, there are $7 \\cdot 6 = 42$ ways to assign the leftovers to the either-gender roles. Multiplying, there are $20 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 42 = \\boxed{25200}$ ways of assigning the six roles."
