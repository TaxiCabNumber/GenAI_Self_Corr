        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA game show offers a contestant three prizes A, B and C, each of which is worth a whole number of dollars from $$ 1$ to $$ 9999$ inclusive. The contestant wins the prizes by correctly guessing the price of each prize in the order A, B, C. As a hint, the digits of the three prices are given. On a particular day, the digits given were $1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3$. Find the total number of possible guesses for all three prizes consistent with the hint.\n",
        "inference": "There are three digits 1 and three digits 3 given.  These can be arranged in any order to form a 6-digit number, so there are $6! = 720$ possibilities for the digits of the three prizes.  No matter how the digits are arranged, the digits of the three prizes will always add up to 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13.  Therefore, the sum of the prizes is always 13,000, and there are 720 possible guesses for all three prizes consistent with the hint.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{720}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since we have three numbers, consider the number of ways we can put these three numbers together in a string of 7 digits. For example, if $A=113, B=13, C=31$, then the string is\n\\[1131331.\\]\nSince the strings have seven digits and three threes, there are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ arrangements of all such strings.\nIn order to obtain all combination of A,B,C, we partition all the possible strings into 3 groups.\nLet's look at the example. We have to partition it into 3 groups with each group having at least 1 digit. In other words, we need to find the solution to\n\\[x+y+z=7, x,y,z>0.\\]\nThis gives us\n\\[\\binom{6}{2}=15\\]\nways by balls and urns. But we have counted the one with 5 digit numbers; that is, $(5,1,1),(1,1,5),(1,5,1)$.\nThus, each arrangement has\\[\\binom{6}{2}-3=12\\]ways per arrangement, and there are $12\\times35=\\boxed{420}$ ways."
