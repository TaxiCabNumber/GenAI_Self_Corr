At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and on region $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  What is the probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$?
