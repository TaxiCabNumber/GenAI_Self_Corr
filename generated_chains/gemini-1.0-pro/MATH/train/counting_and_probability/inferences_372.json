At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMany states use a sequence of three letters followed by a sequence of three digits as their standard license-plate pattern. Given that each three-letter three-digit arrangement is equally likely, the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left) is $\\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet's first find the probability of getting a palindrome in the three-letter arrangement. There are $26$ possible letters for each of the three positions, so the total number of possible arrangements is $26^3 = 17576$. There are $10$ possible palindromes (9 when counting AAA, and 1 when not counting AAA). So, the probability of getting a palindrome in the three-letter arrangement is $\\frac{10}{17576}$.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of getting a palindrome in the three-digit arrangement. There are $10$ possible digits for each of the three positions, so the total number of possible arrangements is $10^3 = 1000$. There are 10 palindromes (000, 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999). So, the probability of getting a palindrome in the three-digit arrangement is $\\frac{10}{1000}$.\n\nThe probability of getting at least one palindrome is the sum of the probabilities of getting a palindrome in the three-letter arrangement and the probability of getting a palindrome in the three-digit arrangement minus the probability of getting a palindrome in both the three-letter arrangement and the three-digit arrangement. The probability of getting a palindrome in both the three-letter arrangement and the three-digit arrangement is $\\frac{10}{17576} \\times \\frac{10}{1000} = \\frac{100}{17576000}$. So, the probability of getting at least one palindrome is $\\frac{10}{17576} + \\frac{10}{1000} - \\frac{100}{17576000} = \\frac{17500}{17576000} + \\frac{17576}{17576000} - \\frac{100}{17576000} = \\frac{33976}{17576000} = \\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nTherefore, $m + n = 33976 + 17576 = \\boxed{51552}.$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{51552}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
