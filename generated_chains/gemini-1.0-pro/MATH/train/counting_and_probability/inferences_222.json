At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBertha has 6 daughters and no sons. Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none. Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of Bertha's daughters who have 6 daughters. Then 6 - x is the number of Bertha's daughters who have no daughters.\n\nThe total number of daughters is 6 * x + (6 - x) = 30.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 4.\n\nTherefore, 6 - x = 2 of Bertha's daughters have no daughters.\n\nAnd 4 of Bertha's daughters have 6 daughters each, for a total of 24 granddaughters.\n\nSo, the total number of daughters and granddaughters with no daughters is 2 + 24 = 26.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$."
