At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach page number of a 488-page book is printed one time in the book.  The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's?",
        "inference": "There are 488 pages in the book, and each page number contains one or two digits. The digits 4 and 8 appear in the following page numbers:\n\n4, 8, 14, 18, 24, 28, ..., 484, 488\n\nThere are 488 / 10 = 48 pages with two digits.\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the following page numbers:\n\n4, 14, 24, ..., 484\n\nThere are 484 / 10 = 48 pages with the digit 4.\n\nThe digit 8 appears in the following page numbers:\n\n8, 18, 28, ..., 488\n\nThere are 488 / 10 = 48 pages with the digit 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 48, and the number of 8's printed is 48.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed minus the number of 8's printed is **0**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Insert leading zeros if necessary to give every page number three digits.  Every digit is used an equal number of times in writing the digits 00, 01, 02, ..., 98, 99, so from page 1 to page 399, the number of 4's used and the number of 8's used are equal.\n\nFrom page 400 to page 488, there are 89 appearances of 4 as a hundreds digit versus 0 appearances of 8 as a hundreds digit.  All 10 numbers 440, 441, ..., 449 with 4 as the tens digit are printed, whereas only the 9 numbers 480, 481, ..., 488 with 8 as the tens digit are printed.  So 4 is used one more time than 8 as a tens digit.  Four and 8 appear 9 times each as a units digit in the numbers 400, 401, ..., 488, so there are no extra 4's in the units place.  In total, $89+1+0=\\boxed{90}$ more 4's are printed than 8's."
