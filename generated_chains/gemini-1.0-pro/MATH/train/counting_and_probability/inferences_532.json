        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA board game spinner is divided into four regions labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{3}{8}$, the probability of it stopping in $B$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of it stopping in region $C$ is equal to the probability of it stopping in region $D$. What is the probability of the arrow stopping in region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of the arrow stopping in region $C$ (and region $D$). \n\nThen, $p + p + \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\n$2p + \\frac{7}{8} = 1$.\n\n$2p = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n$p = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the probability that we want. Since the sum of the four probabilities is 1, we have the equation $1 = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + x + x = \\frac{5}{8} + 2x$.  Solving the equation $1=\\frac{5}{8} + 2x$ gives $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
