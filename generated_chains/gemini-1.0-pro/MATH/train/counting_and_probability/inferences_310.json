At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.**\n\nThere are 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in the drawer. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is $10 + 8 = 18$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes.**\n\nThere are two ways to choose a matching pair: choosing two gray socks or choosing two white socks. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is $2$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of choosing a matching pair is:\n\n$$P(matching\\ pair) = \\frac{number\\ of\\ favorable\\ outcomes}{total\\ number\\ of\\ possible\\ outcomes}$$\n\n$$P(matching\\ pair) = \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{9}$} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$."
