At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers $1447$, $1005$ and $1231$ have something in common: each is a $4$-digit number beginning with $1$ that has exactly two identical digits. How many such numbers are there?\n",
        "inference": "There are $3$ possible choices for the first digit after $1$ since it cannot be $0$ or $1$.\nThere are $2$ possible choices for the second digit in which the digit in the second position is the same as the digit in the first position.\nThere are $3$ possible choices for the third digit after $1$ since it cannot be $0$ or $1$ or the same as the first two digits.\nThere are $3$ possible choices for the last digit after $1$ since it cannot be $0$ or $1$ or the same as the first three digits.\nThus, there are $3\\times 2\\times 3\\times 3=\\boxed{54}$ such numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$. Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$. This means the possible forms for the number are\n$11xy,\\qquad 1x1y,\\qquad1xy1$\nBecause the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq1$, and $y\\neq1$. Hence, there are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nNow suppose that the two identical digits are not $1$. Reasoning similarly to before, we have the following possibilities:\n$1xxy,\\qquad1xyx,\\qquad1yxx.$\nAgain, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq 1$, and $y\\neq 1$. There are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nThus the answer is $216+216=\\boxed{432}$."
