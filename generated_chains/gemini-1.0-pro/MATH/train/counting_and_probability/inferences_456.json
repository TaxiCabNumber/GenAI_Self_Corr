        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf I expand $25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23 \\cdots 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, how many zeros are there at the end of the number I get?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $10=2\\cdot 5$, every zero at the end of the number comes from a factor of $10$.\n\nEvery multiple of $10$ has a factor of $2$ and $5$. Since $2$ occurs more often than $5$ in the product, we need to count the number of factors of $5$.\n\nIn the product $25\\cdot 24\\cdot 23 \\cdots 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$, there are $5$, $10$, $15$, $20$, and $25$ which have factors of $5$. So there are $5$ factors of $5$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To have a zero at the end of a number means that the number is divisible by $10$. $10 = 2\\cdot 5$. Thus, in our multiplication, we want to pair twos and fives. Every other number is divisible by two, every fourth number is divisible by four, etc. This means that we have many more factors of two than of fives, so we just want to count the number of fives that we have available to pair with twos. $\\frac{25}{5} = 5$, so we know that we have $5$ fives (one for $5$, one for $10$, one for $15$, and so on). However, $25 = 5\\cdot 5$, so we have one more five to count. Thus, we have six fives which we can pair with twos, giving us a final answer of $\\boxed{6}$ zeros at the end of the number."
