At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "We need to choose 3 out of 14 players to be the triplets, which can be done in $\\binom{14}{3}$ ways. For the remaining 3 starters, we can choose from the remaining 11 players, which can be done in $\\binom{11}{3}$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 6 starters if all three triplets are in the starting lineup is:\n\n$$\\binom{14}{3}\\cdot\\binom{11}{3}=\\frac{14\\times13\\times12}{3\\times2\\times1}\\cdot\\frac{11\\times10\\times9}{3\\times2\\times1}=14\\times13\\times12\\times11\\times10\\times9=176,940.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{176,940}.$ I hope it is correct.",
