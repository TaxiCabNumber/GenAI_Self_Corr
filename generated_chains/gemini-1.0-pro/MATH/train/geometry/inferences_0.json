At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSquare ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.",
        "inference": "The dilation with scale factor 2 doubles the distance from the dilation center to each of the vertices of the square. We can find the coordinates of the vertices of the original square ABCD by taking the coordinates of the center $(8,-8)$ and adding/subtracting half the length of a side in each direction.\n\nSince the area of the square is 4, the length of a side is $\\sqrt{4}=2$.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertices of ABCD are:\n\n$(8,-8)+(1,0)=(9,-8)$\n$(8,-8)-(1,0)=(7,-8)$\n$(8,-8)+(0,1)=(8,-7)$\n$(8,-8)+(0,-1)=(8,-9)$\n\nThe dilation with center $(0,0)$ and scale factor 2 will multiply the x- and y-coordinates of each vertex by 2.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertices of the image of ABCD are:\n\n$(9,-8)\\times2=(18,-16)$\n$(7,-8)\\times2=(14,-16)$\n$(8,-7)\\times2=(16,-14)$\n$(8,-9)\\times2=(16,-18)$\n\nThe vertex farthest from the origin is $(18,-16)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(18,-16)}$.

        "ground_truth": "With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage. The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units. Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$"
