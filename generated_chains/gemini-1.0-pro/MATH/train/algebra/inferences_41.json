I hope it is correct.'\nKaren drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the difference between the start and end times to get the total driving time.\n```\n1:20 p.m. - 9:40 a.m. = 3 hours and 40 minutes\n```\n**Step 2:** Convert the driving time to hours by dividing the number of minutes by 60.\n```\n3 hours and 40 minutes = 3 + 40/60 = 3.67 hours\n```\n**Step 3:** Divide the distance covered by the driving time to find the average speed.\n```\n165 miles / 3.67 hours = 44.96 miles per hour\n```\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$44.96$}.

        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour."
