        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $2^x+ 2^x+ 2^x+ 2^x= 512$, what is the value of $x$?",
        "inference": "Combining like terms, we have $4 \\cdot 2^x = 512$.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get $2^x = 128$.\nTaking the logarithm of both sides with base 2, we have $x = \\log_2128 = 7$.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we simplify the left side, and we have \\[2^x+2^x+2^x+2^x = 4\\cdot 2^x = 2^2\\cdot 2^x = 2^{x+2}.\\]Noting that $512 = 2^9$, our equation now is $2^{x+2} = 2^9$, so $x+2 = 9$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$."
