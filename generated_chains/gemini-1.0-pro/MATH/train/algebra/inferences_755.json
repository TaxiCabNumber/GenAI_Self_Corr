At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven identical bowling balls weigh the same as four identical canoes. If three of the canoes weigh a total of 84 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the weight of each bowling ball be $x$ pounds and the weight of each canoe be $y$ pounds.\n\nGiven:\n\n- 7 bowling balls = 4 canoes\n- 3 canoes = 84 pounds\n\nFrom the first given, we have:\n\n$$7x = 4y$$\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n$$\\frac{7x}{4} = y$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second given:\n\n$$3 \\cdot \\frac{7x}{4} = 84$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n\n$$7x = 336$$\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n$$x = 48$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{48}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe. We have that $7b=4c$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$, we have $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 7b=\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 4c \\Rightarrow \\frac{21}{4}b=3c=84$. Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\\boxed{16}$ pounds."
