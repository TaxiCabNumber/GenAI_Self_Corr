I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine had 3 paperclips on Monday, then she had 6 on Tuesday, and her number of paperclips proceeded to double on each subsequent day. On what day of the week did she first have more than 100 paperclips?",
        "inference": "**Day 1 (Monday):** 3 paperclips\n**Day 2 (Tuesday):** 6 paperclips (doubled from Monday)\n**Day 3 (Wednesday):** 12 paperclips (doubled from Tuesday)\n**Day 4 (Thursday):** 24 paperclips (doubled from Wednesday)\n**Day 5 (Friday):** 48 paperclips (doubled from Thursday)\n**Day 6 (Saturday):** 96 paperclips (doubled from Friday)\n**Day 7 (Sunday):** 192 paperclips (doubled from Saturday)\n\nTherefore, Jasmine first had more than 100 paperclips on **Sunday**.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{Sunday}$.

        "ground_truth": "This is a geometric sequence with first term 3 and common ratio 2. Thus, any term in this sequence can be represented as $3\\cdot2^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$, where $k+1$ represents the term number (for example, when $k=0$, $3\\cdot2^k = 3$, which is the $k+1=1^\\text{st}$ term of the sequence). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $3\\cdot2^k>100$. Using trial and error, we find that $k=6$, which means that the $6+1=7^\\text{th}$ day is the the one on which Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, or $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$."
