At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many points of intersection are there between the graphs of the following equations: \\begin{align*}\ny &=|2x + 5|, \\\\\ny &= -|3x - 2|\n\\end{align*}",

The graph of the second equation is a V-shaped curve that opens downward, with its vertex at (2/3, 0). These two curves intersect at two points: \\begin{align*}\n(-1, 3) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (2, -2)\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
