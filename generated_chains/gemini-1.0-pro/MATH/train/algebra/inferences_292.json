        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo-thirds of the people in a room are seated in three-fourths of the chairs. The rest of the people are standing. If there are 6 empty chairs, how many people are in the room?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of people in the room x.\n**Step 1:** Find the number of people seated.\nTwo-thirds of the people in the room are seated, so the number of people seated is 2/3 * x.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of chairs.\nThree-fourths of the chairs are occupied, so the number of chairs is (4/3) * 2/3 * x = 8/9 * x.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the number of empty chairs.\nThe number of empty chairs is 6, so we have: \n8/9 * x - (8/9 * x) = 6\n(8/9 * x) - (8/9 * x) = 6\n0  = 6\n\n**Step 4:** Conclusion\nThis is a contradiction, so there are no people in the room that fit the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$0$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Because the 6 empty chairs are $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the chairs in the room, there are $6\\times 4=24$ chairs in all. The number of seated people is $\\frac{3}{4}\\times24=18$, and this is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the people present. It follows that \\[\\frac{18}{\\textrm{people present}}=\\frac{2}{3}.\\]So there are $\\boxed{27}$ people in the room."
