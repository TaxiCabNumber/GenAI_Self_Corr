At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The line $ax+(a+1)y=a+2$ passes through $(4,-8)$, so\n$$a(4)+(a+1)(-8)=a+2$$\n\n$$4a-8a-8=a+2$$\n\n$$4a-8a-a=2+8$$\n\n$$-5a=10$$\n\nDividing both sides by $-5$,\n\n$$a=\\frac{10}{-5}=-2$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the line passes through $(4,-8)$, we know the equation will be satisfied when we plug in $x=4$ and $y=-8$. This gives\n\n\\begin{align*}\na(4)+(a+1)(-8)&=a+2\\\\\n4a-8a-8&=a+2\\\\\n-4a-8&=a+2\\\\\n-10&=5a\\\\\n-2&=a.\n\\end{align*}Thus $a=\\boxed{-2}$. The equation is $-2x-y=0$, or $y=-2x$, and we can see that $(4,-8)$ lies along this line."
