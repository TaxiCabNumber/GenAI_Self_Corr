        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $12$ and their difference is $20$. What is the smaller number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n$$x + y = 12$$\n$$x - y = 20$$\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n$$2x = 32$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x = 16$$\nSubstituting $x = 16$ into the first equation, we get:\n$$16 + y = 12$$\n$$\\Rightarrow y = -4$$\nTherefore, the smaller number is $\\boxed{-4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number. Then we have $x+y=12$ and $x-y=20$. If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get $$x+y-(x-y)=12-20\\qquad\\Rightarrow 2y=-8\\qquad\\Rightarrow y=-4.$$ The smaller number is $\\boxed{-4}$."
