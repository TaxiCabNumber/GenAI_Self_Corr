        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $x$ is greater than 2 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?",
        "inference": "The square root of \\(x\\) is greater than 2 and less than 4. \nThis means that \\(2<\\sqrt{x}<4\\). Squaring both sides of this inequality, we get\n$$4<x<16$$\nTherefore, the integer values of \\(x\\) that satisfy this condition are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. There are 11 such values.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$11$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have: $4 > \\sqrt{x} > 2$. Squaring, we get $16 > x > 4$.  Thus, the integers from 15 to 5, inclusive, satisfy this inequality. That's a total of $15-5+1=\\boxed{11}$ integers."
