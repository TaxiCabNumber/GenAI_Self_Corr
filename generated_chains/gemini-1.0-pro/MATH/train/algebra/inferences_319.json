At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLuke wants to fence a square piece of land of at least 400 square feet. What should the side of the square be if he wants to use the least amount of fencing?",
        "inference": "Let's say the side of the square is x feet.\n\nArea of the square = x^2 square feet\n\nWe know that the area of the square must be at least 400 square feet.\n\nTherefore, x^2 >= 400\n\nx >= 20\n\nSo, the side of the square must be at least 20 feet.\n\nTo use the least amount of fencing, we want the perimeter of the square to be as small as possible.\n\nPerimeter of the square = 4x feet\n\nWe want to minimize 4x.\n\nSince x >= 20, the smallest possible value of x is 20.\n\nTherefore, the side of the square should be 20 feet to use the least amount of fencing.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the land would be $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of the side. Since it has to be at least 400 square feet, we get $s^2\\geq 400$. Therefore, we get that $s \\le -20 \\text{ or } s \\ge 20$. Since the dimensions can't be negative, the least value of $s$ would be $\\boxed{20}$."
