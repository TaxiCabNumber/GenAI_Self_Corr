At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe difference between two positive integers is 12 and their product is 45. What is the sum of the integers?",

Then, we have the following system of equations:\n$$\\begin{align} x+(x+12) &= 45\\\\ x(x+12) &= ? \\end{align}$$\nFrom (1), we get $2x+12 = 45$ which gives $x = 16.5$. However, since $x$ must be an integer, we discard this solution. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\emptyset$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $x$ and $y$ with $x>y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx-y&=12\\\\\nxy&=45\n\\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \\[(x-y)^2=12^2\\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=144\\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\\cdot45=180$. Adding these last two equations, we have \\[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=144+180 \\Rightarrow (x+y)^2=324 \\Rightarrow x+y = 18\\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{18}$."
