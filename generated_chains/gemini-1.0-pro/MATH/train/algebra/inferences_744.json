At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Convert 45 minutes to a fraction of an hour.**\n45 minutes = 45/60 hour = 3/4 hour\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the wall Heidi can paint in 1 hour.**\n1/ (3/4) = 4/3\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the wall Heidi can paint in 9 minutes.**\n(9/60) * (4/3) = 1/5\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1/5}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes."
