        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chess team has $26$ members. However, only $16$ members attended the last meeting: half of the girls attended but all of the boys attended. How many boys are on the chess team?",
        "inference": "There are $26$ members on the chess team, and $16$ attended the meeting. The girls attending is half of the girls on the team, and all the boys attended. Therefore, the number of girls attending plus the number of boys attending equals $16$. \n\nLet $x$ be the number of girls on the team. Then the number of boys on the team is $26-x$. The number of girls attending is $\\frac{x}{2}$. The number of boys attending is $26-x$. So, we have the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{2}+26-x=16$$\n\nSolving for $x$ gives:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{2}+26-x=16$$\n\n$$-x+52=16$$\n\n$$-x=16-52$$\n\n$$-x=-36$$\n\n$$x=36$$\n\nThe number of girls attending is $\\frac{x}{2}=\\frac{36}{2}=18$. So, the number of boys on the team is $26-x=26-36=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Multiplying the second equation by $2$, we get $G+2B=32$. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $B=32-26=6$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team."
