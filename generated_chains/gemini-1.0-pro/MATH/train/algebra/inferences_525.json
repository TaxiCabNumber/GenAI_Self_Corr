        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ are there so that the sum of the reciprocals of $m$ and $n$ is $\\frac14$?",
        "inference": "Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}=\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{m+n}{mn}=\\frac{1}{4} \\Rightarrow 4(m+n)=mn \\Rightarrow 4m+4n=mn \\Rightarrow mn-4m-4n=0$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow (m-4)(n-4)=20=1 \\cdot20=2\\cdot10=4\\cdot5$$\n\nSo, there are 4 possibilities for $(m - 4,n - 4)$: $(1,20), (10,2), (4,5), (5,4)$. This corresponds to four ordered pairs $(m, n)$: $(5,24), (14,6), (8,9), (9,8)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "As an equation, $\\frac 1m + \\frac 1n = \\frac 14$. Multiplying both sides by $4mn$ to clear out the denominators gives $4n + 4m = mn$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that  $$mn - 4m - 4n + 16 = (m-4)(n-4) = 16.$$Thus, $m-4$ and $n-4$ are pairs of factors of $16$; to satisfy the positive condition, both factors must also be positive. Then, $$(m-4,n-4) = (1,16),(2,8),(4,4),(8,2),(16,1),$$yielding $\\boxed{5}$ distinct ordered pairs."
