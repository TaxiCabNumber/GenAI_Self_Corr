        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two pairs $(x,y)$ of real numbers that satisfy the equation $x+y = 3xy = 4$. Given that the solutions $x$ are in the form $x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$ where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers and the expression is completely simplified, what is the value of $a + b + c + d$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $x+y = 3xy = 4$, we have $y = \\frac{4}{x}-x$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get\n\n$$x+\\frac{4}{x}-x = 4 \\Rightarrow \\frac{4}{x} = 4 \\Rightarrow x = 1.$$Substituting $x=1$ into $y=\\frac{4}{x}-x$, we get $y=3$. Therefore, the solution to the equation is $(x,y)=(1,3)$.\n\nSince $x = \\frac{a \\pm b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$ where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers and the expression is completely simplified, we have $a = 1$, $b = 0$, $c = 1$, and $d = 1$. Therefore, $a + b + c + d = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by considering the equation $x + y = 4$. From this, we know that $y = 4-x$. We can then substitute this into the equation $3xy = 4$ to get $3x(4-x) = 12x - 3x^2 = 4$. This then becomes $3x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find  \\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144-48}}{6} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nx &= \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{3}.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a + b + c + d = 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = \\boxed{17}$."
