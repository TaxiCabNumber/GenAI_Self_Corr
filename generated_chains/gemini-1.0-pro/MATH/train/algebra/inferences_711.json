I hope it is correct.'\nAfter Sally takes 20 shots, she has made $55\\%$ of her shots. After she takes 5 more shots, she raises her percentage to $56\\%$. How many of the last 5 shots did she make?",

        "ground_truth": "If Sally makes $55\\%$ of her 20 shots, she makes $0.55 \\times 20 = 11$ shots. If Sally makes $56\\%$ of her 25 shots, she makes $0.56 \\times 25 = 14$ shots. So she makes $14-11=\\boxed{3}$ of the last 5 shots."
