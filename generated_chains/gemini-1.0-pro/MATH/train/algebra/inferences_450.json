        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of cans in the layers of a display in a supermarket form an arithmetic sequence. The bottom layer has 28 cans; the next layer has 25 cans and so on until there is one can at the top of the display. How many cans are in the entire display?",
        "inference": "Let the number of layers be \\(n\\). The number of cans in the display is \n$$S_n = (28+(28-(n-1)\\times 3))\\times \\frac{n}{2}=28n-\\frac{3n(n-1)}{2}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{28n-\\frac{3n(n-1)}{2}}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The arithmetic series is $1 + 4 + \\cdots + 25 + 28$, with a common difference of 3. Suppose there are $n$ terms in the series. Then 28 is the $n$th term, so $1 + (n-1)\\cdot 3 = 28$. Solving, we get $n = 10$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 28)/2 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{145}$."
