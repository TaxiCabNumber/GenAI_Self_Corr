At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Factor the expression to find the vertex of the parabola.\n\n$-16t^2+64t+31 = -16(t^2-4t)+31 = -16(t^2-4t+4-4)+31 = -16(t-2)^2+95$\n\n**Step 2:** The vertex of the parabola is given by the point $(h, k)$, where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate and $k$ is the $y$-coordinate. In this case, $h=2$ and $k=95$.\n\n**Step 3:** The maximum height of the ball is equal to the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{95}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+64t+31=-16(t^2-4t)+31.\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-4t)+31&=-16(t^2-4t+4-4)+31\\\\\n&=-16([t-2]^2-4)+31\\\\\n&=-16(t-2)^2+95.\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+95=\\boxed{95}$ feet."
