        "ground_truth": "Let $2x$ be the smaller integer.  Then the larger integer is $5x$.  The product of the integers is 160, so $(2x)(5x)=160\\implies 10x^2=160 \\implies x^2=16$.  Since $x$ is positive, this implies $x=4$ which in turn implies that the larger integer is $5\\cdot4=\\boxed{20}$."
