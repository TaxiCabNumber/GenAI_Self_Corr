At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose the point $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f(x)}2$. Then there is one point which must be on the graph of $y=\\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}$. What is the sum of that point's coordinates?",

        "ground_truth": "Since $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f(x)}2$, we know that $$2 = \\frac{f(1)}{2},$$which implies that $f(1)=4$.
