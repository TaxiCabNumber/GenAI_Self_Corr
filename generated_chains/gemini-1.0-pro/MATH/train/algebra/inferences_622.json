At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $3+a=4-b$ and $4+b=7+a$, what is $3-a$?",

        "ground_truth": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n3+a&=4-b, \\\\\n4+b&=7+a.\n\\end{align*}Adding the two equations, we get $3+a+4+b=4-b+7+a$, which simplifies to $7+a+b=11+a-b$. Cancelling $a$ from both sides, we get $7+b=11-b$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=2$. Plugging this into the first equation above, we obtain $3+a=4-2$. Hence $a=-1$ and $3-a=\\boxed{4}$."
