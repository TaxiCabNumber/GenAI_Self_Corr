At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the greatest integer value of $b$ for which the expression $\\frac{9x^3+4x^2+11x+7}{x^2+bx+8}$ has a domain of all real numbers.",
        "inference": "For the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the denominator must not be equal to zero for any real number. Thus, we solve the equation $x^2+bx+8=0$.  Using the quadratic formula, we get  $$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4(1)(8)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-32}}{2}.$$ For the denominator to be nonzero for all real numbers, the discriminant must be negative. Thus, we solve the inequality $b^2-32<0$.  Solving, we get $$\\begin{split} b^2-32<0 \\\\\\ b^2<32 \\\\\\ -4\\sqrt{8}<b<4\\sqrt{8} \\\\\\ -8<b<8. \\end{split}$$ Therefore, the greatest integer value of $b$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$.

        "ground_truth": "In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{5}$."
