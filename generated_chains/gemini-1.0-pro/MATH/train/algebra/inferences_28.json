I hope it is correct.'\nFor all real numbers $r$ and $s$, define the mathematical operation $\\#$ such that the following conditions apply: $r\\ \\#\\ 0 = r, r\\ \\#\\ s = s\\ \\#\\ r$, and $(r + 1)\\ \\#\\ s = (r\\ \\#\\ s) + s + 1$.

Since we want to increase $r$ $5$ times to find $11 \\#5 =5 \\# 11$, we want to increase $0 \\# 11$ by $12$ five times.
