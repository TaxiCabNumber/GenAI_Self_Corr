        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndy, Beth, Charlie, and Daniel take a test with thirty questions. Andy and Beth together get the same number of questions wrong as Charlie and Daniel together. Andy and Daniel together get four more questions wrong than Beth and Charlie do together. If Charlie gets five questions wrong, how many questions does Andy get wrong?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of questions Andy gets wrong as x, Beth as y, Charlie as z, and Daniel as w.\n\nFrom the first sentence, we know that x + y = z + w.\n\nFrom the second sentence, we know that x + w = y + z + 4.\n\nSince Charlie gets 5 questions wrong, we know that z = 5.\n\nSubstituting z = 5 into the first equation, we get: x + y = 5 + w.\n\nSubstituting z = 5 and the above equation into the second equation, we get: x + w = y + 5 + 4.\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get: x + w = y + 9.\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the above equation, we get: 5 + w = y + 9.\n\nSolving for y, we get: y = 4.\n\nSubstituting y = 4 into the first equation, we get: x = 1.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the number of questions Andy got wrong, $b$ the number of questions Beth missed, $c$ the number of questions Charlie answered incorrectly, and $d$ the number of questions Daniel got wrong. Using the information given in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na + b &= c + d \\\\\na + d &= b+c +4 \\\\\nc = 5\n\\end{align*} Adding the first two equations together yields $2a + b + d = 2c + b + d + 4$, which simplifies to $a = c + 2$. Since $c = 5$, Andy must have answered $\\boxed{7}$ questions incorrectly."
