        "inference": "In order for the graph of $f(x)$ to be continuous, the value of $f(x)$ at $x = 2$ must be the same from both the left and right sides.\n\nFrom the left side, we have $f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 3 = 5$.\n\nFrom the right side, we have $f(2) = a(2) + 4 = 2a + 4$.\n\nTherefore, we must have $5 = 2a + 4$, which gives $a = \\boxed{1/2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/2}$.
