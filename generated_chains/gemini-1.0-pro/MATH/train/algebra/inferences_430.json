At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the arithmetic sequence $17, a, b, c, 41$, what is the value of $b$?",
        "inference": "The common difference, $d$, of an arithmetic sequence is the difference between any two consecutive terms. In this case, we have:\n$$d=a-17=b-a=c-b=41-c$$\nSince $a$ is the second term, $b$ is the third term, and $c$ is the fourth term, we have:\n$$a=17+d$$\n$$b=17+2d$$\n$$c=17+3d$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the given sequence, we get:\n$$17, 17+d, 17+2d, 17+3d, 41$$\nSetting the last term equal to $41$, we get:\n$$17+3d=41$$\nSolving for $d$, we get:\n$$d=8$$\nTherefore, $b=17+2d=\\boxed{33}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In an arithmetic sequence, the average of two terms equals the value of the term halfway between them.  So we have that $b = \\frac{17 + 41}{2} = \\boxed{29}$."
