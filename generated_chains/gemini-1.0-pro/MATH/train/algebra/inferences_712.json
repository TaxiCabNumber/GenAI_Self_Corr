At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good?",
        "inference": "1. Lines 1 and 2 are parallel since their slopes are equal to each other: 3.\n2. Lines 3 and 4 are perpendicular to each other since their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other: $\\frac{-9}{3}=3$ and $\\frac{-1}{2}=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n3. Lines 4 and 5 are parallel since their slopes are equal to each other: $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ pairs of lines that are good.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We find the slope for each line. The slopes are $\\frac31=3$, $\\frac42=2$, $\\frac93=3$, $\\frac12$, and $\\frac14$.\nParallel lines have the same slope, therefore lines $a$ and $c$ are parallel. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. None of the slopes above are negative reciprocals, therefore there are no perpendicular lines. There are $1+0=\\boxed{1}$ pairs of lines that are parallel or perpendicular."
