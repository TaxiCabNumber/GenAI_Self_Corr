At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$. What is the y-intercept of line $a$?",
        "inference": "Since line $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$, it has the same slope as line $y=2x+4$, which is $2$.\n\nThe equation of a line in point-slope form is:\n```\ny - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\n```\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\nSubstituting the given point $(2,5)$ and the slope $m=2$ into the point-slope form equation, we get:\n```\ny - 5 = 2(x - 2)\n```\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n```\ny - 5 = 2x - 4\n```\n```\ny = 2x + 1\n```\nThe y-intercept of a line is the value of $y$ when $x=0$. Substituting $x=0$ into the equation of line $a$, we get:\n```\ny = 2(0) + 1\n```\n```\ny = 1\n```\nTherefore, the y-intercept of line $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$."
