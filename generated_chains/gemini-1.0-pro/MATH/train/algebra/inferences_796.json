At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the slope of a line parallel to the line $2x - 4y = 9$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the line we seek is parallel to the given line, the slope of the line we seek must be the same as the slope of the given line.\n\nThe given line is in the form $ax + by = c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.\n\nThe slope of a line in the form $ax + by = c$ is $-\\frac{a}{b}$.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the given line is $-\\frac{2}{4}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The slope-intercept form of the equation of a line is $y = m x + b$ where $m$ is the slope.  So if we get $y$ on the opposite side from $x$ and make it have a coefficient of 1, the slope of the line will be the coefficient of $x$.  Thus we add $4y$ to both sides and divide everything by 4 which makes the coefficient of $x$ equal to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
