So $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 12.2$ if and only if $r$ is between $\\lfloor 12.2$ and $12.2$.  Since $\\lfloor 12.2$ is $12$ by definition, the solution is those $r$ between $12$ and $12.2$.\nFinal Answer: $12 \\le r < 12.2$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we note that $r$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r$ is nonpositive. Next, because $\\lfloor r \\rfloor$ is an integer and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r=12.2$, the decimal part of $r$ must be $0.2$.  Therefore, $r=n+0.2$ for some integer $n$, so that $\\lfloor r\\rfloor =n$ and $\\lfloor r \\rfloor + r = 2n+0.2 =12.2$. Therefore, $n=6$, and the only value of $r$ that satisfies the equation is $\\boxed{r=6.2}$."
