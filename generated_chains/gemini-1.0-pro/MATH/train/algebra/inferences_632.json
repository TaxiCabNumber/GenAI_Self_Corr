        "inference": "**Solution:**\n* The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.\n* We are given that the slope is $-2$, so the equation of the line is $y = -2x + b$.\n* We are also given that the $x$-intercept is $(5,0)$, which means that when $x = 5$, $y = 0$.\n* Substituting these values into the equation, we get $0 = -2(5) + b$.\n* Solving for $b$, we get $b = 10$.\n* Therefore, the $y$-intercept is $(0,10)$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{(0,10)}$.

        "ground_truth": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right.
