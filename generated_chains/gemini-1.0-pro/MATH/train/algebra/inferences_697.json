At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo regular polygons have the same perimeter. If the first has 38 sides and a side length twice as long as the second, how many sides does the second have?",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the second polygon be x. Then, the side length of the first polygon is 2x. Since the perimeters are equal, we have:\n\n$$\\text{Perimeter of first polygon} = \\text{Perimeter of second polygon}$$\n$$38(2x) = x(s)$$\n$$76x = xs$$\n$$76 = s$$\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{76}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides."
