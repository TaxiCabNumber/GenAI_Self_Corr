At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFrom the following infinite list of numbers, how many are integers? $$\\sqrt{4096},\\sqrt[3]{4096},\\sqrt[4]{4096},\\sqrt[5]{4096},\\sqrt[6]{4096},\\ldots$$",
