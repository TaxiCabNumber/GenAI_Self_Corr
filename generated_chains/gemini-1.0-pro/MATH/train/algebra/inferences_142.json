At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k > 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
        "inference": "1. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. In this case, the output values of $f(x)$ are all positive numbers, since $x^k$ is always positive for $x > 0$ and $k > 0$.\n\n\n2. The range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is therefore the set of all positive numbers greater than or equal to $1$.\n\n\n3. This set can be written as $\\{y | y \\geq 1\\}$.\n\n\n4. So the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is $\\{y | y \\geq 1\\}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\{y | y \\geq 1\\}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because $k > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ increases without bound.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values greater than or equal to 1, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$."
