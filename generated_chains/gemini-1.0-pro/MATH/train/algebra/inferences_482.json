        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Find the volume ratio between the two boxes.\n\n$$\\frac{48 \\text{cm}^3}{16 \\text{cm}^3} = 3$$\n\nStep 2: Multiply the volume ratio by the number of paperclips in the first box.\n\n$$50 \\text{paperclips} \\times 3 = 150 \\text{paperclips}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips."
