At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn airplane has three sections: First Class (24 seats), Business Class ($25\\%$ of the total number of seats) and Economy ($\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total number of seats). How many seats does the plane have?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the total number of seats on the plane is $x$.\n\nSo, the number of seats in Business Class is $0.25x$ and the number of seats in Economy is $\\frac{2}{3}x$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seats is:\n\n$$24+0.25x+\\frac{2}{3}x=x$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$24+0.25x+\\frac{2}{3}x=x$$\n\n$$24+0.25x+0.6666667x=x$$\n\n$$24+0.9166667x=x$$\n\n$$0.0833333x=24$$\n\n$$x=\\frac{24}{0.0833333}$$\n\n$$x=288$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{288}.$ I hope it is correct.",
