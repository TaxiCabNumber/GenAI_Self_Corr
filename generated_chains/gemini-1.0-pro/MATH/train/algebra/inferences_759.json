What is the smallest $n$ for which the $n$th term of the sequence is divisible by one million?",

        "ground_truth": "The common ratio is $$\\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 20$$Therefore, the $n$th term is $(20^{n-1}) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\n\n\nIf one million (aka $10^6$) divides the $n$th term, then it must be divisible by $5^6$.
