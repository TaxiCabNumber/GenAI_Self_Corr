        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ are the coordinates of two opposite vertices of a rectangle, what is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices?",
        "inference": "Let the other two vertices be $(x,y)$ and $(x,z)$.\nSince the opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel and equal in length, we have $17-1=z-(-4)$, which gives $z=22$.\nThus, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices is $y+z=y+22$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{y+22}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$."
