At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA horse 24 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 32 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 8 feet from the center have to make?",
        "inference": "Let \\( x \\)  be the number of revolutions.\n\nDistance traveled by the first horse = \\( 24 \\pi(32) =  768 \\pi \\) feet\n\nSince the horses travel the same distance:\n\n\\( 8\\pi x = 768 \\pi \\)\n\nDividing both sides by \\( 8\\pi \\)\n\n\\( x = \\frac{768 \\pi}{8\\pi} = 96\\)\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$96$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 3 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $32\\times3=\\boxed{96}$ revolutions."
