At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe amount of algae covering the Smith's backyard pond doubled every day until it was completely covered in algae on day $30$ of the month. On what day of that month was $75\\%$ of the pond algae-free?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the day of the month when $75%$ of the pond was algae-free. Since the amount of algae doubled every day, we can write the equation:\n\n$$100\\% - 75\\% = 2^{x-30}$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$25\\% = 2^{x-30}$$\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\n$$\\log_{2} 0.25 = x - 30$$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$$x = 30 - \\log_{2} 0.25$$\n\n$$x = 30 - (-2)$$\n\n$$x = 32$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$32$}.

        "ground_truth": "We are trying to find the day of the month on which the pond was $75\\%$ algae-free, or the day when the pond was $25\\%$ covered. On day $30$ of the month the pond was completely covered, and the amount of algae doubled every day. This means that on day $29$, the pond was half covered in algae, and therefore on day $\\boxed{28}$ the pond was $25\\%$ covered in algae."
