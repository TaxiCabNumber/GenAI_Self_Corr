        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers, $x$, satisfy $|5x - 3| \\le 7$?",
        "inference": "First, solve the inequality $|5x - 3| \\le 7$. This is equivalent to $-7 \\le 5x - 3 \\le 7$. Adding 3 to all three parts, we get $-4 \\le 5x \\le 10$. Dividing all three parts by 5, we get $-\\frac{4}{5} \\le x \\le 2$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of integers $x$ that satisfy this inequality. The integers that satisfy this inequality are $-1, 0, 1, and 2$. There are $\\boxed{4}$ such integers in total.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We'll consider two cases.\n\n\nCase 1: $5x-3$ is nonnegative.  If $5x-3$ is nonnegative, then $|5x-3| = 5x-3$, so we have $5x - 3 \\le 7$.  Solving this gives $x \\le 2$.  The only integers for which $x\\le 2$ and $5x-3$ is nonnegative are $1$ and $2$.\n\nCase 2: $5x-3$ is negative.  If $5x - 3$ is negative, then $|5x-3| = -(5x-3)$, so the inequality becomes $-(5x-3) \\le 7$.  Multiplying by $-1$ gives $5x-3 \\ge -7$, so $5x \\ge -4$, which means $x \\ge -0.8$.  The only integer greater than $-0.8$ for which $5x-3$ is negative is $0$.\n\nCombining these cases gives us $\\boxed{3}$ integers that satisfy the inequality."
