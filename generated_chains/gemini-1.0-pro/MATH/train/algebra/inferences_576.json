If we increase $a$ by 6, decrease $b$ by 6 and multiply $c$ by 5, the three resulting numbers are equal. What is the value of $b$?",
        "inference": "First, let's define the three resulting numbers as $a + 6$, $b - 6$, and $5c$. \n\nSince these three resulting numbers are equal, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$$a + 6 = b - 6 = 5c$$ \n\nWe can then substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:\n\n$$5c - 6 = b - 6$$ \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$5c = b$$ \n\nFinally, we can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get:\n\n$$5c + 6 = b - 6$$ \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$b = 12 + 5c$$ \n\nSince we know that the sum of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is 99, we can substitute the equations for $b$ and $c$ into the equation to get:\n\n$$a + (12 + 5c) + 5c = 99$$ \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$a + 12 + 10c = 99$$ \n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$a + 10c = 87$$ \n\nSubtracting $a$ from both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n$$10c = 87 - a$$ \n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 10, we get:\n\n$$c = \\frac{87 - a}{10}$$ \n\nSubstituting this equation for $c$ into the equation for $b$, we get:\n\n$$b = 12 + 5\\left(\\frac{87 - a}{10}\\right)$$ \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$b = 12 + \\frac{435 - 5a}{10}$$ \n\n$$b = \\frac{120 + 435 - 5a}{10}$$ \n\n$$b = \\frac{555 - 5a}{10}$$ \n\n$$\\boxed{Final \\ Answer: \\ b=\\frac{555-5a}{10}. \\ I \\ hope \\ it \\ is \\ correct.}$$",
        "ground_truth": "We are given the equations $a+b+c=99$ and $a+6=b-6=5c$.  Solve $b-6=5c$ for $b$ to find $b=5c+6$, and solve $5c=a+6$ for $a$ to find $a=5c-6$.  Substituting both of these equations into $a+b+c=99$, we have $(5c-6)+(5c+6)+c=99$.  Simplifying the left hand side, we get $11c=99$ which implies $c=9$.  Substituting into $b=5c+6$, we have $b=5(9)+6=\\boxed{51}$."
