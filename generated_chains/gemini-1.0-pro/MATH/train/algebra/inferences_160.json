At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let \\(n\\) be the smallest of the three consecutive positive integers. Then the other two numbers are \\(n+1\\) and \\(n+2\\). Since the sum of their squares is 7805, we have \n$$n^2+(n+1)^2+(n+2)^2=7805.$$\n\nSimplifying this, we get \n\n$$3n^2+6n+5=7805.$$\n\nSubtracting 7805 from both sides, we get\n\n$$3n^2+6n-7800=0.$$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get \n\n$$n^2+2n-2600=0.$$\n\nFactoring the left side, we get \n\n$$(n+52)(n-50)=0.$$\n\nSince \\(n\\) is a positive integer, the only solution is \\(n=50\\). \n\nTherefore, the three consecutive positive integers are 50, 51, and 52.

        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the middle of these integers, then we have $(n-1)^2+n^2+(n+1)^2 = 3n^2+2 = 7805$, or $n^2 = 2601$, meaning that $n=51$. Thus the sum of the cubes is $50^3+51^3+52^3 = \\boxed{398259}$."
