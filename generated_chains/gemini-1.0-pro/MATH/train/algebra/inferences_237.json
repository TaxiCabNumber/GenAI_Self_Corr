At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of $x^2-13x+4=0$.",
        "inference": "The roots of $x^2-13x+4=0$ are $x=1$ and $x=4$. Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is $\\frac{1}{1}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$. Notice that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots can be obtained by dividing the first equation by the second equation: $\\frac{r_1+r_2}{r_1r_2}=\\frac{1}{r_1}+\\frac{1}{r_2}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}$."
