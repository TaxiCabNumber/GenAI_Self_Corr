At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is $10$. If the fifth term is $5$, what is the sixth term?",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nWe are given that the sum of the first four terms is $10$, so we have:\n\n$$a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) = 10$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$4a + 6d = 10$$\n\n$$a + 2d = 2.5$$\n\nWe are also given that the fifth term is $5$, so we have:\n\n$$a + 4d = 5$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$$2d = 2.5$$\n\n$$d = 1.25$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $d$ back into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$a + 2(1.25) = 2.5$$\n\n$$a = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is:\n\n$$a + 5d = 0 + 5(1.25) = \\boxed{6.25}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.25}$.

        "ground_truth": "Call the common difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. We can express the first four terms in terms of $x$ and the fifth term: The fourth term is $5-x$, the third is $5-2x$, etc. So, we have $(5-4x) + (5-3x) + (5-2x) + (5-x) = 10$, which simplifies to $-10x = -10$, or $x = 1$. So the sixth term is $5+1 = \\boxed{6}$."
