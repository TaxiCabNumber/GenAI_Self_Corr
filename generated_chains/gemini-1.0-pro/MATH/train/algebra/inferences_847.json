        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Mr. Abraham's class, $10$ of the $15$ students received an $A$ on the latest exam. If the same ratio of students received an $A$ on Mrs. Berkeley's latest exam, and if Mrs. Berkeley has $24$ students total, how many students in Mrs. Berkeley's class received an $A$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the ratio of students who received an A in Mr. Abraham's class.\n\nRatio = (Number of students who received an A) / (Total number of students)\nRatio = 10 / 15\nRatio = 2/3\n\n**Step 2:** Assume that the same ratio applies to Mrs. Berkeley's class.\n\nRatio = (Number of students who received an A) / (Total number of students)\n2/3 = (Number of students who received an A) / 24\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for the number of students who received an A in Mrs. Berkeley's class.\n\n(Number of students who received an A) = Ratio * Total number of students\n(Number of students who received an A) = (2/3) * 24\n(Number of students who received an A) = 16\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{16}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $10$ of $15$ students received an $A$, then the ratio of students receiving an $A$ to students not receiving an $A$ is $\\frac{10}{15}$, or $\\frac{2}{3}$. Let $x$ be the number of students in Mrs. Berkeley's class who received an $A$. Since the ratio is consistent across the two classes, $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{24}$. Cross-multiplying yields $x = \\frac{24\\cdot 2}{3}$, so, by simplification, we can see that $\\boxed{16}$ of Mrs. Berkeley's students must have received an $A$."
