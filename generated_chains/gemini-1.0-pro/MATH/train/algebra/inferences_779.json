At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe cost of five pencils and one pen is $\\$2.50$, and the cost of one pencil and two pens is $\\$1.85$. What is the cost of two pencils and one pen?",
        "inference": "Let the cost of one pencil be $p$ and the cost of one pen be $q$.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\n\n$$5p+q=2.50\\Rightarrow q=2.50-5p$$\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\n\n$$p+2q=1.85\\Rightarrow 2q=1.85-p\\Rightarrow q=0.925-0.5p$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $q$, we get:\n\n$$2.50-5p=0.925-0.5p\\Rightarrow 4.5p=1.575\\Rightarrow p=0.35$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $p$ into the first statement, we get:\n\n$$5(0.35)+q=2.50\\Rightarrow q=2.50-1.75=\\boxed{0.75}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.75}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the cost of one pencil be $a$ and the cost of one pen be $b$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. The equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5a + b &= 2.5 \\\\\na + 2b &= 1.85 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are trying to find the value of $2a + b$. Notice that when we add the two equations, we get $6a+3b=4.35$. This is just three times what we are looking for, so dividing both sides of this last equation by three, we get that $2a+b=1.45$. Thus, the cost of two pencils and one pen is $\\boxed{1.45}$ dollars.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve our system of equations for $a$ and $b$ and then find the value of $2a+b$. In this case, we get that $a=.35$ and $b=.75$, so $2a+b=1.45$, as expected."
