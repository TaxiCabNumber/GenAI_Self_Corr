At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the sum of the squares of the solutions of $x^2-13x+4=0$.",
        "inference": "The sum of the squares of the solutions of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\\frac{b^2}{a^2}$.\n\nFor the given equation $x^2-13x+4=0$, we have $a=1$ and $b=-13$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the solutions is $\\frac{(-13)^2}{1^2} = \\frac{169}{1} = 169$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{169}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Therefore, $r_1+r_2=13$ and $r_1r_2=4$. Notice that $r_1^2+2r_1r_2+r_2^2=169$. This means that the sum of the squares of the roots can be obtained by subtracting the term containing the product of $r_1$ and $r_2$, so $r_1^2+r_2^2=169-2(4)=\\boxed{161}$."
