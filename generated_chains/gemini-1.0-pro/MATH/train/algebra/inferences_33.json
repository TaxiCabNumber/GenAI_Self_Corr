        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all of the solutions of the equation $\\frac{4x}{20}=\\frac{5}{x}$?",
        "inference": "$$\\frac{4x}{20}=\\frac{5}{x}$$\n$$20\\cdot\\frac{4x}{20}=20\\cdot\\frac{5}{x}$$\n$$4x=100$$\n$$x=\\frac{100}{4}$$\n$$x=25$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Rewrite $\\frac{4}{20}$ as $\\frac{1}{5}$ and multiply both sides by $5x$ to obtain $x^2=25$.  The solutions of this equation are $\\pm\\sqrt{25}=\\pm5$, and their sum is $(-5)+5=\\boxed{0}$."
