At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvaluate $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{140}\\right\\rceil$.",
        "inference": "The square root of 140 is approximately 11.83. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer, so $\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{140}\\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil11.83\\right\\rceil = \\boxed{12}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The value $\\sqrt{140}$ lies between the two nearest integers.  Let the two nearest integers be $z_1$ and $z_2$.  Then we have $$z_1<\\sqrt{140}<z_2$$Because all values in the inequality are positive, it is appropriate to square each value and obtain $$z_1^2<140<z_2^2$$We only need the value of the perfect square greater than 140, which is 144.  Thus the least integer greater than $\\sqrt{140}$ is $\\sqrt{144}=\\boxed{12}$."
