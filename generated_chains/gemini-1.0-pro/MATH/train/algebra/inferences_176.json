At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at an interest rate of $5\\%$ per year, compounded yearly.  How much money will Frederick have when he collects the money at the age of $18$? Give your answer to the nearest hundredth of a dollar.",
