At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo calculate $31^2$, Emily mentally figures the value $30^2$ and adds 61. Emily subtracts a number from $30^2$ to calculate $29^2$. What number does she subtract?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the unknown number that Emily subtracts from $30^2$ to calculate $29^2$. Then, we have the following equation:\n\n$$30^2 - x = 29^2$$\n\nSimplifying both sides, we get:\n\n$$900 - x = 841$$\n\nSubtracting 841 from both sides, we have:\n\n$$59 = -x$$\n\nTherefore, the number that Emily subtracts is $x = -59$.\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{-59}$$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $29^2 = (30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - 2\\cdot 30 \\cdot 1 +1 = 30^2 - 59$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{59}$."
