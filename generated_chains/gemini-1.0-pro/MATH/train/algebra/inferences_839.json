        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a toaster (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 12 customers buy a toaster that costs $\\$500$, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $\\$750$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION:**\nLet \\(y\\) be the number of customers who buy a toaster. \n\nAccording to Daniel, the popularity of a toaster is inversely proportional to its cost \\(x\\). That is,\n\n$$y=k\\cdot \\frac{1}{x},$$\n\nfor some constant \\(k\\). \n\nSubstituting \\(x = 500\\) and \\(y = 12\\) into the equation, we get \n\n$$12=k\\cdot \\frac{1}{500}\\Rightarrow k=6000.$$\n\nTherefore, the equation of proportionality is\n\n$$y = 6000 \\cdot  \\frac{1}{x}.$$\n\nIf the cost is $\\$750$, then the number of customers who would buy a toaster is\n\n$$y = 6000 \\cdot \\frac{1}{750} = \\boxed{8}.$$\n\n\n**Final Answer: 8. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the popularity of a toaster (or the number of customers who buy the appliance) equal $p$, and let the cost of the toaster equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=12$ when $c=500$, then $k=(12)(500)=6000$. So when $c=750$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(750)&=6000\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{6000}{750}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{8}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 8 customers would buy the $\\$750$ toaster."
