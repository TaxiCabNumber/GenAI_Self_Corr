At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graphs of $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2-3x-2$ are drawn.  For every $x$, a vertical segment connecting these two graphs can be drawn as well.  Find the smallest possible length of one of these vertical segments.",
        "inference": "1. The two graphs are $y=|x|$ and $y=-x^2-3x-2$.\n\n2. The length of the vertical segment connecting two graphs is the distance between the two graphs. The distance between two lines $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$ at a point $x=a$ is given by $|f(a)-g(a)|$.\n\n3. Therefore, the length of the vertical segment connecting two graphs for every $x$ is $|f(x)-g(x)|$.\n\n4. We want to find the smallest possible value of $|f(x)-g(x)|$.\n\n5. We can rewrite $f(x)-g(x)$ as $f(x)-g(x)=|x|-(-x^2-3x-2)$.\n\n6. We can rewrite $|x|-(-x^2-3x-2)$ as $|x|+x^2+3x+2$.\n\n7. We can rewrite $|x|+x^2+3x+2$ as $|x|+(x^2+3x+2)$.\n\n8. We can rewrite $x^2+3x+2$ as $(x+\\frac{3}{2})^2-\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n9. Therefore, we can rewrite $|x|+x^2+3x+2$ as $|x|+(x+\\frac{3}{2})^2-\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n10. We can rewrite $|x|+(x+\\frac{3}{2})^2-\\frac{1}{4}$ as $|x+\\frac{3}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n11. Therefore, we want to find the smallest possible value of $|x+\\frac{3}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n12. The smallest possible value of $|x+\\frac{3}{2}|-\\frac{1}{4}$ is $-\\frac{1}{4}$ when $x+\\frac{3}{2}=0$.\n\n13. When $x+\\frac{3}{2}=0$, $x=-\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n14. Therefore, the smallest possible length of one of the vertical segments is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
