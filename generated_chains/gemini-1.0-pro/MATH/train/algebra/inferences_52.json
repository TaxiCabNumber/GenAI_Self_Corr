At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $45$. Their difference is $3$. What is the lesser of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.\nThen,\n\n\n$$x + y = 45 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x - y = 3$$\nAdding the two equations, we get\n$$2x = 48$$\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get\n$$x = 24$$\nSubstituting this value of $x$ in the first equation, we get\n$$24 + y = 45$$\nSubtracting $24$ from both sides, we get\n$$y = 21$$\nTherefore, the lesser of the two numbers is $y = \\boxed{21}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$. Thus: $y=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\\boxed{21}$."
