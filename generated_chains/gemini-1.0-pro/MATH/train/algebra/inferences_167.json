At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k < 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
        "inference": "Since $k < 0$, $f(x) = x^k > 0$ for all $x > 0$. Therefore, the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$ is the set of all positive real numbers greater than or equal to 1.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{[1, \\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are looking at the range of $f(x)$ when $x$ is in the interval $[1,\\infty)$. Because $k < 0$, $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ approaches 0, but never reaches it.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values between 0 (exclusive) and 1 inclusive, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$."
