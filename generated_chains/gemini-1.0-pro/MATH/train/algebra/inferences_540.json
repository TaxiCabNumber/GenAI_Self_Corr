        "inference": "The quadratic equation $2x^2 + 5x + b = 0$ has rational roots if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. The discriminant is given by $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot b = 25 - 8b$. For this to be a perfect square, it must be of the form $(2k)^2 = 4k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus, we have $25 - 8b = 4k^2$. Rearranging, we get $8b = 25 - 4k^2$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $25 - 4k^2$ must be divisible by 8. The only positive integer values of $k^2$ that satisfy this are $k^2 = 0, 1, 4$. Therefore, the only possible values of $b$ are $b = \\frac{25}{8}, \\frac{21}{8}, \\frac{17}{8}$. The sum of these values is $\\frac{25}{8} + \\frac{21}{8} + \\frac{17}{8} = \\frac{63}{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{63}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $2x^2 + 5x + b = 0$ has two rational solutions, then its discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot b = 25 - 8b$, must be a perfect square. Since $b$ is positive, it follows that $25 - 8b \\ge 0 \\Longrightarrow b \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. Checking each one, we see that $b = 2$ and $b = 3$ indeed work, and their sum is $2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$."
