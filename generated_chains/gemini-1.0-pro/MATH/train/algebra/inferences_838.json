At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the equation $x + 2y + 3 = 0$ is perpendicular to the graph of the equation $ax + 2y + 3 = 0$. What is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Since the two lines are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other.\nThe slope of the first line is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, the slope of the second line is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe slope-intercept form of an equation is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nThe given equation $ax + 2y + 3 = 0$ can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$.\nSo, the slope of the second line is $-\\frac{a}{2}$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{a}{2}$.\nSolving for $a$, we get $a = -1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. The first line has slope $-\\frac12$ and the second $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $\\frac{a}{4}=-1$ and $a=\\boxed{-4}$."
