        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the areas of two squares is $\\frac{32}{63}$. After rationalizing the denominator, the ratio of their side lengths can be expressed in the simplified form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers.

        "ground_truth": "The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of side lengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{32}{63}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{32}}{\\sqrt{63}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{7}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{7}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}}=\\frac{4\\sqrt{14}}{21}.$$So, our answer is $4+14+21=\\boxed{39}$."
