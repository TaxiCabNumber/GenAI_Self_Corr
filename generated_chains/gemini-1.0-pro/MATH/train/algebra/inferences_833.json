At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Tuesday, I worked $t+1$ hours and earned $3t-3$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $3t-5$ hours but only earned $t+2$ dollars an hour. At the end of the day, I had earned two dollars more than he had. What is the value of $t$?",
        "inference": "I worked $(t+1)$ hours at $(3t-3)$ dollars an hour. So I earned $(t+1)(3t-3)$ dollars.\n\nAndrew worked $(3t-5)$ hours at $(t+2)$ dollars an hour. So he earned $(3t-5)(t+2)$ dollars. \n\nI earned two dollars more than he did, so $(t+1)(3t-3)= (3t-5)(t+2)+2$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$3t^2-3t+3t-3=3t^2+6t-5t-10+2$\n\n$3t^2-3t+3t-3=3t^2+t-8$\n\n$-t-3=-8$\n\n$-t=-5$\n\nTherefore, $t=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since I earned two dollars more than Andrew, we know that $$(t+1) (3t-3) = (3t-5)(t+2) + 2 \\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3t^2-3 = 3t^2 + t -8 .$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{5}$."
