        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(2,3)$ and $(-6,5)$?",
        "inference": "Let the midpoint of the line segment be $(x,y)$. Then, by definition,\n$$\\frac{2 + (-6)}{2}=x \\Rightarrow x=-2$$\nand \n$$\\frac{3 + 5}{2}=y \\Rightarrow y=4$$\nTherefore, the product of the coordinates of the midpoint is $xy=(-2)(4)=\\boxed{-8}.$\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$-8$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \\frac{3+5}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-8}$."
