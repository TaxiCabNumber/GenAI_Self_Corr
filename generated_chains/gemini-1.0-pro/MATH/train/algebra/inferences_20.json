At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt what point does the line containing the points $(1, 7)$ and $(3, 11)$ intersect the $y$-axis? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
        "inference": "The slope of the line is \\((11-7)/(3-1)=2\\). The line passes through the point \\((1, 7)\\). Therefore, the equation of the line is \\(y-7=2(x-1)\\), or \\(y=2x+5\\).\n\nTo find the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis, we set \\(x=0\\):\n\n$$y=2(0)+5=5.$$\n\nTherefore, the point of intersection is \\((0, 5)\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{(0, 5)} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $y$-axis is where the $x$-coordinate is $0$.  Using the given points, as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $2$, the $y$-coordinate decreases by $4$.  So as the $x$-coordinate decreases by $1$ from $1$ to $0$, the $y$-coordinate will decrease by $2$ from $7$ to $5$.  The point is $\\boxed{(0,5)}$."
