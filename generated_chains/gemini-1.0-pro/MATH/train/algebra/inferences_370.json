        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $x$-intercept of the line perpendicular to the line defined by $3x-2y = 6$ and whose $y$-intercept is 2?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION:**\n1. The given line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n2. The line perpendicular to this line has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.\n3. The equation of the perpendicular line in point-slope form is:\n$$y - 2 = -\\frac{2}{3}(x - 0)$$\n4. Simplifying this equation gives:\n$$y - 2 = -\\frac{2}{3}x$$\n5. In slope-intercept form, this equation is:\n$$y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$$\n6. The $x$-intercept occurs when $y = 0$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$0 = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$$\n7.

        "ground_truth": "By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \\frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\\frac{2}{3} x + 2$.  We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \\boxed{3}$."
