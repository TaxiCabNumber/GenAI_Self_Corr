        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the slope of the line determined by any two solutions to the equation $\\frac{2}{x}+\\frac{3}{y} = 0$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n$$\\frac{2}{x}+\\frac{3}{y} = 0$$\n\n$$3y+2x = 0$$\n\n$$y=-\\frac{2}{3}x$$\n\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of $x$. Therefore, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can quickly see that we can get a solution to the equation if the first fraction is 1 and the second is -1 which gives $(x, y) = (2, -3)$.  Similarly if we let $(x, y) = (-2, 3)$ we get the first fraction to be $-1$ and the second to be 1.  The slope of the line through these two points is $\\frac{-3 - 3}{2 - (-2)} = \\boxed{- \\frac 32}$."
