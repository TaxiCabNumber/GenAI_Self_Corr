        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes.  How long, in seconds, does it take six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub?  Assume that all faucets dispense water at the same rate.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the volume of water dispensed by each faucet per minute.\n\nVolume of water dispensed by 3 faucets in 6 minutes = 100 gallons\n\nVolume of water dispensed by 1 faucet in 6 minutes = 100 / 3 = 33.33 gallons\n\nVolume of water dispensed by 1 faucet in 1 minute = 33.33 / 6 = 5.56 gallons\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the volume of water dispensed by six faucets per minute.\n\nVolume of water dispensed by 6 faucets in 1 minute = 6 * 5.56 = 33.36 gallons\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the time it takes for six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub.\n\nTime = Volume of tub / Volume of water dispensed per minute\n\nTime = 25 / 33.36 = 0.75 minutes\n\n**Step 4:** Convert the time to seconds.\n\nTime in seconds = 0.75 * 60 = 45 seconds\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds."
