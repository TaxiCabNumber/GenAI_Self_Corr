At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt took $4$ days for $75$ workers, all working together at the same rate, to build an embankment. If only $50$ workers had been available, how many total days would it have taken to build the embankment?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** \n\nLet $t$ be the number of days it would have taken $50$ workers to build the embankment. So, the amount of work done by $50$ workers in $1$ day is $\\frac{1}{t}$.\n\nThe amount of work done by $75$ workers in $1$ day is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSince the work is the same, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{t}=\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{50}{75}=\\frac{1}{6}$$\n\nTherefore, the number of days it would have taken $50$ workers to build the embankment is $t=\\boxed{6}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}.
