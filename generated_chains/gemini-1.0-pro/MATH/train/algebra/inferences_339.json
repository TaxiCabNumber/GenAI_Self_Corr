At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZachary paid for a $\\$1$ burger with 32 coins and received no change. Each coin was either a penny or a nickel. What was the number of nickels Zachary used?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of nickels Zachary used. Then the number of pennies he used is $32-x$. Since the value of a nickel is 5 cents and the value of a penny is 1 cent, the total value of the coins he used is $5x + (32-x) = 5x + 32 - x = 4x + 32$ cents. Since Zachary paid for a $\\$1$ burger, we have\n\n$$4x + 32 = 100 \\Rightarrow 4x = 68 \\Rightarrow x = 68/4 = 17.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $p$ is the number of pennies and $n$ is the number of nickels that Zachary used, then we are given \\begin{align*}\np+n&=32\\text{, and} \\\\\np+5n&=100.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we find $4n=68$ which implies $n=\\boxed{17}$."
