        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least integer whose square is 48 more than its double?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the integer. We have\n$$x^2=2x+48\\\\ \\Rightarrow x^2 - 2x-48 = 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow (x - 8)(x + 6) = 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow x = 8, -6$$\n\nSince \\(x\\) is a positive integer, so \\(x = \\boxed{8}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{8}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From the information given, we have $x^2 = 2x + 48$. Rearranging, we get $x^2 - 2x - 48 = 0$, which we can factor as $(x+6)(x-8) = 0$. Therefore, $x = -6\\text{ or }8$.  Since we want the lesser, $\\boxed{-6}$ is our answer."
