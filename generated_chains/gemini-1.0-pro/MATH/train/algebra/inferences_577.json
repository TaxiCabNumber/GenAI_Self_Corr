At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a hot day, Megan likes to eat a Popsicle every 15 minutes. Assuming she keeps up that rate of consumption, how many Popsicles can Megan finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes?",
        "inference": "To calculate the number of Popsicles Megan can finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes, we need to determine the total number of 15-minute intervals within that time frame.\n\n1. Convert 4 hours and 30 minutes into minutes:\n4 hours = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes\n30 minutes = 30 minutes\n\nTotal minutes = 240 minutes + 30 minutes = 270 minutes\n\n2. Determine the number of 15-minute intervals in 270 minutes:\nNumber of intervals = 270 minutes / 15 minutes per interval\nNumber of intervals = 18 intervals\n\n3. Since Megan consumes one Popsicle every 15 minutes, she can finish:\nNumber of Popsicles = 1 Popsicle per interval x 18 intervals\nNumber of Popsicles = 18 Popsicles\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ be the number of Popsicles Megan can finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes. If we convert that period of time into minutes, we find that 4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to $(4)(60)+30=270$ minutes. From here, we can set up the proportion  \\begin{align*} \\frac{x}{270}& =\\frac{1}{15}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)(270)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\boxed{18}\n\\end{align*}"
