        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile watching a circus show, I counted out the number of acrobats and elephants. I counted 40 legs and 15 heads. How many acrobats did I see in the show?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nLet \\(a\\) be the number of acrobats and \\(e\\) be the number of elephants.\nWe know that \\(a + e = 15\\) (number of heads) and \\(2a + 4e = 40\\) (number of legs).\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of \\(a\\) and \\(e\\).\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get \\(2a + 4e - (a + e) = 40 - 15 = 25\\).\nSimplifying, we get \\(a + 3e = 25\\).\nNow we can substitute the first equation into this equation to get \\(15 + 3e = 25\\).\nSolving for \\(e\\), we get \\(e = \\frac{10}{3}\\).\nSubstituting this value of \\(e\\) back into the first equation, we get \\(a + \\frac{10}{3} = 15\\).\nSolving for \\(a\\), we get \\(a = \\frac{35}{3}\\).\nSince the number of acrobats must be an integer, we can round this to \\(a = 12\\).\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of acrobats in the show be $a$ and the number of elephants be $e$. We are looking for the value of $a$. Assuming that each acrobat has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each elephant has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2a+4e &= 40 \\\\\na + e &= 15 \\\\\n\\end{align*}To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $e$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $e=15-a$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $e$ gives $2a+4(15-a) = 40$, or $a=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ acrobats in the circus show."
