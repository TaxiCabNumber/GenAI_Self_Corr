        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $33$-gon $P_1$ is drawn in the Cartesian plane.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of the $33$ vertices equals $99$.  The midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ form a second $33$-gon, $P_2$.  Finally, the midpoints of the sides of $P_2$ form a third $33$-gon, $P_3$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$.",
        "inference": "Since the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ is $99$, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of $P_1$ is $\\frac{99}{2}$.  Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ is $\\frac{99}{4}$ and the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ is $\\frac{99}{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$\\frac{99}{8}$}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_1$ be $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{33}$.  Then, by the midpoint formula, the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_2$ are $\\frac{x_1+x_2}2,\\frac{x_2+x_3}2,\\ldots,\\frac{x_{33}+x_1}2 $.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2x_1+2x_2+\\cdots +2x_{33}}2=x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_{33}$.  Similarly, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of $P_3$ equals the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of  $P_2$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{99}$."
