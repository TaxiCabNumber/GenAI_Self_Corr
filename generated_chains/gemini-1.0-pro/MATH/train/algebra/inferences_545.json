At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sixteenth and seventeenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 8 and 10, respectively. What is the second term?",
        "inference": "Let d be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. Then, we have:\n\na + 15d = 8\na + 16d = 10\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\n\nd = 2\n\nSubstituting d = 2 back into the first equation, we get:\n\na + 15(2) = 8\n\na + 30 = 8\n\na = -22\n\n**Final Answer**: -22. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term in the arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  The sixteenth term is $a + 15d = 8$, and the seventeenth term is $a + 16d = 10$, so the common difference is $d = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a + 15d = 8$, we get $a + 30 = 8$, so $a = -22$.  Then the second term is $a + d = -22 + 2 = \\boxed{-20}$."
