At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|x-5|=12$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Solve the equation $|x-5|=12$ by considering two cases:\n- Case 1: $x-5=12$\n- Case 2: $x-5=-12$\n\n**Step 2:** Solve each case:\n- Case 1: $x-5=12 \\Rightarrow x=12+5 = 17$\n- Case 2: $x-5=-12 \\Rightarrow x=-12+5 = -7$\n\n**Step 3:** Identify the largest value of $x$:\nThe largest value among $17$ and $-7$ is $17$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{17}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can split the expression $|x-5|=12$ into two separate cases: $x-5=12$ and $x-5=-12$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=12+5=17$. For the second case, we would get $x=-12+5=-7$. Therefore, $x=17$ and $x=-7$ both satisfy the equation. Since the problem asks for the largest value of $x$, our solution is $\\boxed{17}$."
