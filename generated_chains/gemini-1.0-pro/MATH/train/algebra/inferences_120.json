At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0$ has positive integer solutions where $A$ is a positive  single digit. How many such $A$s exist? (Since $A$ is representing a digit, if $A = 2$ then   $A0$ represents the integer 20.)",
        "inference": "1. For $x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0$ to have positive integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square.\n\n2. The discriminant is $(1A)^2 - 4(A0) = A^2 - 40A.$\n\n3. Since $A$ is a positive single digit, $A^2 - 40A = (A - 40)(A + 1).$\n\n4. Therefore, either $A - 40 = 1$ or $A + 1 = 1$.\n\n5. Solving these equations, we get $A = 41$ or $A = 0$.\n\n6. Since $A$ is a positive single digit, the only valid solution is $A = 1$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We need to find two numbers with a product of $A0$ and a sum of $1A$, where $A$ is a positive single digit. There are only 9 digits to try for $A$. Suppose we have a product of 10 and a sum of 11, then the two numbers could be 1 and 10. Suppose we have a product of 20 and a sum of 12, then the two numbers are 2 and 10. This will work for all values of $A$ from 1 to 9, so there are $\\boxed{9\\text{ values}}$ of $A$ that work."
