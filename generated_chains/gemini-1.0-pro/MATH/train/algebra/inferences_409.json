        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $kx^2+20x+k=0$ is given by\n\n\n$$D=(20)^2-4k(k)=400-4k^2.$$For the equation to have rational solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Thus, we need to solve the equation $$400-4k^2=m^2$$for some integer $m$. Rearranging, we get $$(20-2k)(20+2k)=m^2,$$which means that $20-2k$ and $20+2k$ are both perfect squares. Since $k$ is positive, $20-2k$ is less than $20$ and therefore cannot be a perfect square. Thus, we only need to consider the case where $20+2k$ is a perfect square. Solving the equation $(20+2k)^2=m^2$, we get $k=10\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-100}$. Since $k$ is positive, we have $m^2-100\\ge0$, or $m^2\\ge100$. Thus, the possible values of $m$ are $m\\ge10$. Substituting these values into $k=10\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-100}$, we get the possible values of $k$ as $$k=10\\pm\\sqrt{m^2-100}\\ge10\\pm\\sqrt{100-100}=10.$$Therefore, the solution is $$\\boxed{k=10}.$$",

Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+20x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $400-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square.
