At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe difference between two perfect squares is 133.  What is the smallest possible sum of the two perfect squares?",
        "inference": "Let the two perfect squares be $x^2$ and $y^2$, where $x<y$.\n\nWe have $y^2-x^2=133$.\n\nFactoring, we get $(y+x)(y-x)=133$.\n\nThe prime factorization of 133 is $133=7\\cdot19$.\n\nTherefore, $y+x=7$ and $y-x=19$, or vice versa.\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$ in each case, we find that $x=2$ and $y=9$ or $x=12$ and $y=21$.\n\nThe smallest possible sum of the two squares is $2^2+9^2=85$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{85}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are given that $x^2 - y^2 = 133$, which is the same as $(x+y)(x-y) = 133$. $133$ has two pairs of factors: 1 and 133, and 7 and 19. So, either $x+y = 133$ and $x-y = 1$, or $x+y = 19$ and $x-y = 7$. It is clear that $x$ and $y$ will be much larger in the first case, because they must sum to 133, so, because we are trying to minimize $x^2 + y^2$, we can simply consider the second case. Through simple algebra, we find that $x = 13$ and $y = 6$. Thus, $x^2 + y^2$ is minimized as $169 + 36 = \\boxed{205}$."
