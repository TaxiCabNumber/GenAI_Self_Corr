        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of the floor in a square room is 225 square feet. The homeowners plan to cover the floor with rows of 6-inch by 6-inch tiles. How many tiles will be in each row?",
        "inference": "The area of the floor is 225 square feet. \nThe area of a single tile is 6*6 = 36 square inches. \nThen the number of tiles in each row is 225*12*12/36 = 80.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{80}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The length of each side of the room is $\\sqrt{225}=15$ feet, or $15\\cdot12=180$ inches. Since each tile has a length of 6 inches, each row needs $180/6=\\boxed{30}$ tiles."
