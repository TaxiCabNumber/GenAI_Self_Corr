At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose the graph of $y=f(x)$ includes the points $(1,5),$ $(2,3),$ and $(3,1)$.\n\nBased only on this information, there are two points that must be on the graph of $y=f(f(x))$. If we call those points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d),$ what is $ab+cd$?",
        "inference": "Since $f(1) = 5$, we know that $(1, 5)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$. So $f(f(1)) = f(5)$, and $(5, f(5))$ is on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$.\n\nSimilarly, $f(f(2)) = f(3)$, so $(3, f(3))$ is on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$.\n\nTherefore, one possible point on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$ is $(5, f(5))$, and another possible point is $(3, f(3))$.\n\nSo $ab + cd = (5)(f(5)) + (3)(f(3))$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(5)(f(5)) + (3)(f(3))}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $f(1)=5,$ $f(2)=3,$ and $f(3)=1$.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(2))=f(3)=1$ and $f(f(3))=f(1)=5$.\n\nThis tells us that the graph of $y=f(f(x))$ passes through $(2,1)$ and $(3,5)$, and the desired expression is $(2)(1)+(3)(5)=\\boxed{17}$."
