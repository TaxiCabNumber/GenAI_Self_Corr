At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the eight terms in the arithmetic sequence $-2, 3, \\dots, 33$?",
        "inference": "First, we find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence:\n\n$$d = 3 - (-2) = 5.$$\n\nNext, we find the number of terms in the sequence:\n\n$$n = \\dfrac{33 - (-2)}{5} + 1 = 8.$$\n\nFinally, we use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n$$S_n = \\dfrac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n),$$\n\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term and $a_n$ is the $n$th term. Substituting into the formula, we get:\n\n$$S_8 = \\dfrac{8}{2}(-2 + 33) = \\dfrac{8}{2}(31) = 124.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$124$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $\\dfrac{-2 + 33}{2} \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{124}$."
