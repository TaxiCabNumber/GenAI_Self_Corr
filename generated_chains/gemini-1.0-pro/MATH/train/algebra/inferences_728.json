At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree of the four vertices of a rectangle are $(5, 11)$, $(16, 11)$ and $(16, -2)$. What is the area of the intersection of this rectangular region and the region inside the graph of the equation $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9$? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",

        "ground_truth": "The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, so the fourth point must make a vertical line with (5,11) and a horizontal one with (16,-2); this means that the fourth point is (5,-2).
