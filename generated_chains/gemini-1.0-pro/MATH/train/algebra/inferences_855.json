At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a map, a 12-centimeter length represents 72 kilometers.  How many kilometers does a 17-centimeter length represent?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of kilometers that a 17-centimeter length represents. Then, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n$$\\frac{12}{17} = \\frac{72}{x}$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$12x = 1224$$\n\nDividing both sides by 12, we get:\n\n$$x = 102$$\n\nTherefore, a 17-centimeter length represents 102 kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{102}$.
