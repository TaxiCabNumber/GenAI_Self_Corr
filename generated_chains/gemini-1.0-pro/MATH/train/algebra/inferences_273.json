At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAddison's age is three times Brenda's age. Janet is six years older than Brenda. Addison and Janet are twins. How old is Brenda?",
        "inference": "Let Brenda's age be x.\n\nThen, Addison's age is 3x.\n\nAnd, Janet's age is x + 6.\n\nSince Addison and Janet are twins, we have:\n\n3x = x + 6\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 6\n\nx = 6/2\n\nx = 3\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age. Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\\begin{cases}\nA=3B \\\\\nJ = B+6 \\\\\nA=J\n\\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$. Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \\Rightarrow B=3$. Thus, Brenda is $\\boxed{3}$ years old."
