        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
        "inference": "I had planned to earn $\\$3000$ in $20\\times12=240$ hours of work. Since I didn't work for 2 weeks, I have only $240-2\\times20=200$ hours left to work.  \nI need to work $\\frac{3000}{200}=\\boxed{15}$ hours a week for the rest of the summer to buy the car.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week."
