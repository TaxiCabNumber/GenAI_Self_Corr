        "inference": "Let the intersection points be $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. Then, we have\n\n$$3-x_1^2+x_1^3 = 1+x_1^2+x_1^3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x_1=0, x_1=-2$$\n\nand\n\n$$3-x_2^2+x_2^3 = 1+x_2^2+x_2^3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x_2=-1.$$\n\nTherefore, the $y$-coordinates of the intersection points are $y_1=3$, $y_2=3$, and $y_3=2$. The maximum difference between these $y$-coordinates is $3-2 = 1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The graphs intersect when the $y$-values at a particular $x$ are equal.  We can find this by solving \\[3-x^2+x^3=1+x^2+x^3.\\]This simplifies to  \\[2(x^2-1)=0.\\]This has two solutions, at $x=1$ and $x=-1$.  The $y$-coordinates for these points are  \\[1+1^2+1^3=3\\]and \\[1+(-1)^2+(-1)^3=1.\\]The difference between these values is $\\boxed{2}$."
