At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nXanthia can read 100 pages per hour and Molly can read 50 pages per hour. If they each read the same book, and the book has 225 pages, how many more minutes than Xanthia would it take for Molly to finish reading the book?",
        "inference": "1. Xanthia can read 100 pages in 1 hour, so she can read 225 pages in $\\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.\n2. Convert 2.25 hours to minutes: $2.25 \\cdot 60 = 135$ minutes\n3. Molly can read 50 pages in 1 hour, so she can read 225 pages in $\\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.\n4. Convert 4.5 hours to minutes: $4.5 \\cdot 60 = 270$ minutes\n5. Molly would take $270-135=\\boxed{135}$ more minutes than Xanthia to finish reading the book.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Reading the book takes Xanthia\n\n$\\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.\n\nIt takes Molly\n\n$\\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.\n\nThe difference is $2.25$ hours, or $2.25(60)=\\boxed{135}$ minutes."
