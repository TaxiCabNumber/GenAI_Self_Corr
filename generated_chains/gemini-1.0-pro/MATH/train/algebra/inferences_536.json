        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the roots be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=63$ and $pq=k$. Since $p$ and $q$ are prime, $p+q$ is even, which implies that $p$ and $q$ are both odd.\n\nLet $p=2m+1$ and $q=2n+1$. Then $p+q=2(m+n+1)$ and $pq=4(m+1)(n+1)-2$. Since $p+q$ is even, $m+n+1$ is even. Also, since $p$ and $q$ are odd, $m$ and $n$ are even.\n\nTherefore, $p=2(2l+1)+1=4l+3$ and $q=2(2r+1)+1=4r+3$ for some integers $l$ and $r$. Then $p+q=4(l+r+1)$ and $pq=4(4l+3)(4r+3)-2=16(4l^2+6lr+3r^2)-2=64(l^2+lr+r^2)-2$.\n\nSince $pq=k$, we have $64(l^2+lr+r^2)-2=k$. Therefore, $l^2+lr+r^2=\\frac{k+2}{64}$.\n\nSince $l^2+lr+r^2$ is an integer, $k$ must be even. Also, $l^2+lr+r^2\\geq 0$, so $k\\geq -2$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $k$ are $-2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{63}$.
