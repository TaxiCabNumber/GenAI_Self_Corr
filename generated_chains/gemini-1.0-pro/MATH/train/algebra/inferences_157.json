If she works for 30 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$3000$, how many hours per week must she work?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the number of hours Amy works per week during the school year by x.\n\nDuring the summer, Amy worked a total of 36 * 10 = 360 hours and earned $3000. Therefore, her hourly wage is $3000 / 360 = $8.33 per hour.\n\nIf she needs to make another $3000 during the school year, she will need to work a total of $3000 / $8.33 = 360 hours.\n\nSince she will be working for 30 weeks during the school year, she needs to work 360 hours / 30 weeks = **12 hours** per week during the school year.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 3 times as many weeks, she can work 3 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
