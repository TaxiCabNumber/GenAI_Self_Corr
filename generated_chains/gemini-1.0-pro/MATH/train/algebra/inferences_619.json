After $12$ gallons have been used, it is half full. How many gallons does this tank hold when it is full?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nIf the tank is $\\frac{7}{8}$ full, the fraction of the tank that is empty is $1-\\frac{7}{8}=\\frac{1}{8}$.\nIf $12$ gallons have been used and the tank is half full, the fraction of the tank that has been used is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the fraction of the tank that is full after $12$ gallons have been used is $1-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe fraction of the tank that is empty after $12$ gallons have been used is $1-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe fraction of the tank that is empty when the tank is full is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\nSince the fraction of the tank that is empty is the same before and after $12$ gallons have been used, we can set up the following equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{12}{x} $$\nwhere $x$ is the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full.\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{12}{x} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{x}{2x}-\\frac{12}{x} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{x-24}{2x} $$\n$$ 2x=8(x-24) $$\n$$ 2x=8x-192 $$\n$$ -6x=-192 $$\n$$ x=32 $$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32}$.
