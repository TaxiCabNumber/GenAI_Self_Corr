At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers are there in the solution set of $|x-2| \\leq 5.6$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** First, notice that $|x-2| \\leq 5.6$ is equivalent to $-5.6 \\leq x-2 \\leq 5.6$. Adding $2$ to all parts, we get $-3.6 \\leq x \\leq 7.6$. Finally, we round the endpoints up and down to the nearest integers, which gives us $-4 \\leq x \\leq 8$. There are $8-(-4)+1=13$ integers in this range.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $|x-2|$ is an integer, it can equal 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  If $|x-2| = 0$, we have only one solution for $x$.  Otherwise we have 2.  This leads to a total of $\\boxed{11}$ integers in the solution set."
