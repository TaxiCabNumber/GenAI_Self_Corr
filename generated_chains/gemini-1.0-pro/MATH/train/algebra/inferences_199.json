        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 21 is the sum of two consecutive integers 10 and 11. What is the largest number of positive, consecutive integers whose sum is 21?",
        "inference": "The sum of $n$ consecutive integers starting from $a$ is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{n}{2}(a+a+n-1)$$\n\nFor this sum to be equal to 21, we must have:\n\n$$\\frac{n}{2}(2a+n-1)=21$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$(2a+n-1)=\\frac{42}{n}$$\n\nSince $a$ and $n$ are integers, the right-hand side of the equation must be an integer. The largest integer divisor of 42 is 6, so we must have $n=6$.\n\nSubstituting $n=6$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$$2a+6-1=7$$\n\n$$2a=2$$\n\n$$a=1$$\n\nTherefore, the largest number of positive, consecutive integers whose sum is 21 is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we see that $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$.  If a number is the sum of seven or more consecutive positive integers, then the number must be at least $1 + 2 + \\dots + 7 = 7 \\cdot 8/2 = 28$, so $\\boxed{6}$ is the largest number of consecutive integers we can use."
