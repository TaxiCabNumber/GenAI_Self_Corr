At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that a rectangle with length $3x$ inches and width $x + 5$ inches has the property that its area and perimeter have equal values, what is $x$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe area of the rectangle is $3x(x + 5) = 3x^2 + 15x$.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is $2(3x) + 2(x + 5) = 6x + 10$.\nSince the area and perimeter are equal, we have\n\n\n$$3x^2 + 15x = 6x + 10.$$\nSolving this equation, we get\n$$3x^2 + 15x - 6x - 10 = 0.$$\n$$3x^2 + 9x - 10 = 0.$$\n$$(3x - 5)(x + 2) = 0.$$\nSo, $x = \\boxed{5/3}$ or $x = -2$.  Since $x$ must be positive, the only solution is $x = 5/3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{5/3}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $l$ represent the length of the rectangle and $w$ represent the width so that $l = 3x$ and $w = x + 5$. Since the area of the rectangle equals its perimeter, we have that $l \\times w = 2l + 2w$. We can then substitute $3x$ back in for $l$ and $x + 5$ in for $w$ to get  \\begin{align*}\n& (3x)(x+5) = 2(3x) + 2(x + 5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 15x = 6x + 2x + 10 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & 3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad & (x - 1)(3x + 10) = 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get that the two possible values of $x$ are $x = 1$ and $x = - \\frac{10}{3}$.
