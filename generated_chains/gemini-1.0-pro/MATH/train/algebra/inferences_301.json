        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $a$ is a nonzero constant for which the equation $ax^2+20x+7=0$ has only one solution. Find this solution.",
        "inference": "The discriminant, $D$, of the quadratic equation $ax^2+20x+7=0$ is given by $D=20^2-4(a)(7)=400-28a$. Since the equation has only one solution, we have $D=0$. Solving for $a$, we get $a=\\frac{400}{28}=14.28571429$. Substituting this value of $a$ back into the equation, we get $14.28571429x^2+20x+7=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{-20\\pm\\sqrt{20^2-4(14.28571429)(7)}}{2(14.28571429)}=-0.70238291\\pm0.31008178i$. Therefore, the solution to the equation is \\boxed{$x=-0.70238291\\pm0.31008178i$}.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$x=-0.70238291\\pm0.31008178i$}. I hope it is correct.",
