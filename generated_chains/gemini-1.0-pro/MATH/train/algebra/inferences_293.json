At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two values of $a$  for which the equation $4x^2+ax+8x+9=0$ has only one solution for $x$. What is the sum of those values of $a$?",
        "inference": "The equation $4x^2+ax+8x+9=0$ has only one solution for $x$ if and only if its discriminant is zero. The discriminant of the equation is $$ b^2-4ac = a^2-4(4)(9) = a^2-144.$$ So we want to solve the equation $a^2-144=0$. Factoring, we get $$(a+12)(a-12)=0.$$ Therefore, $a=\\boxed{-12}$ or $a=\\boxed{12}$. The sum of these two values is $-12+12=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
