At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo arithmetic sequences $A$ and $B$ both begin with 30 and have common differences of absolute value 10, with sequence $A$ increasing and sequence $B$ decreasing. What is the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence $A$ and the 51st term of sequence $B$?",
        "inference": "The 51st term of an arithmetic sequence with first term $a$, common difference $d$ is given by $a+(n-1)d$.\n\nFor sequence $A$, $a=30$, $d=10$, so the 51st term is $30+(51-1)10=30+500=530$.\n\nFor sequence $B$, $a=30$, $d=-10$, so the 51st term is $30+(51-1)(-10)=30-500=-470$.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence $A$ and the 51st term of sequence $B$ is $|530-(-470)|=|530+470|=|1000|=1000$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1000$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$.  Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$.  Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1000}$."
