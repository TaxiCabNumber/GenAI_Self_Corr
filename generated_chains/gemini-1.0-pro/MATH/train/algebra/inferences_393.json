        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe force needed to loosen a bolt varies inversely with the length of the handle of the wrench used. A wrench with a handle length of 9 inches requires 375 pounds of force to loosen a certain bolt. A wrench of 15 inches will require how many pounds of force to loosen the same bolt?",
        "inference": "Let F be the force needed and L be the length of the handle.\nSince the force F varies inversely with the length L, we can write:\n$$F=\\frac{k}{L}$$\nwhere k is a constant.\nWe can find the value of k using the given information:\n$$375=\\frac{k}{9}$$\n$$k=375\\times9=3375$$\nNow we can find the force F for a wrench of length 15 inches:\n$$F=\\frac{k}{L}=\\frac{3375}{15}=\\boxed{225}$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{225}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "When we change from a 9-inch wrench to a 15-inch wrench, we multiply the length of the wrench by $\\frac{15}{9} = \\frac{5}{3}$.  Since the wrench length and the force required are inversely proportional, their product must be constant.  So, when we multiply the wrench length by $\\dfrac53$, we must multiply the force required by $\\dfrac35$ in order to keep their product constant.  So, the force required is $(375)\\left(\\frac35\\right) = \\boxed{225}$ pounds of force."
