        "inference": "1. Let the other endpoint be $(x,y)$. Since the midpoint of a line segment is the average of the coordinates of its endpoints, we have:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{6+x}{2}, \\frac{-10+y}{2}\\right) = (8,0)$$\n\n2. Equating the x-coordinates, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{6+x}{2} = 8$$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$$6+x = 16$$\n\n$$x = 10$$\n\n3.

Therefore, the other endpoint is $(10,10)$, and the sum of the coordinates is:\n\n$$10 + 10 = 20$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}.$ I hope it is correct.",
