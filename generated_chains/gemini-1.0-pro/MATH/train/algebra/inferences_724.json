At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

A perfect square trinomial has a first and last term that are perfect squares and a middle term which is double the product of the square roots of the first and last terms. \n**Step 2**: Since $x^2 - 16x + k$ is a perfect square trinomial, the first term ($x^2$) and the last term ($k$) are perfect squares. The square root of the first term is $x$, and the square root of the last term is $\\sqrt{k}$. \n**Step 3**: The middle term ($-16x$) is double the product of the square roots of the first and last terms, so $-16x = 2x\\sqrt{k}$. \n**Step 4**: Divide both sides of the equation by $2x$ to get $-8 = \\sqrt{k}$.  \n**Step 5**: Square both sides of the equation to get $64 =k$. \n**Step 6**: The value of $k$ that makes $x^2 - 16x + k$ the square of a binomial is $k = 64$. \n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{64}$.
