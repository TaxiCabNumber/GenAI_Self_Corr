At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the domain of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** \nThe domain of a function is the set of all values of the independent variable for which the function is defined. For the function $f(x)=\\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$, the denominator must be non-zero. Therefore, we must solve the inequality $x^2-3x-4\\neq0$.\n\n$$x^2-3x-4\\neq0$$\n\n$$(x-4)(x+1)\\neq0$$\n\n$$x\\neq4,-1$$\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers except $x=4$ and $x=-1$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$x\\in\\mathbb{R}, x\\neq4, -1$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The function is defined when the value inside the square root is positive, i.e. we must have $x^2-3x-4>0$. Factoring, we get $(x-4)(x+1)>0$. So either both factors in the left hand side are negative or they are both positive. They are both negative when $x<-1$. They are both positive when $x>4$. So the domain of $f(x)$ is $x<-1 \\text{ or } x>4$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (4, \\infty)}$ in interval notation."
