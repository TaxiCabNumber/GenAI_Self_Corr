        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLee can make 18 cookies with two cups of flour. How many cookies can he make with three cups of flour?",
        "inference": "We need to find a way to relate the number of cookies to the amount of flour. We know that 18 cookies can be made with 2 cups of flour. So, we can write the following proportion:\n\n```\n18 cookies / 2 cups = x cookies / 3 cups\n```\n\nWe can cross-multiply to solve for x:\n\n```\n18 cookies * 3 cups = 2 cups * x cookies\n54 cookies = 2x cookies\nx cookies = 27 cookies\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of cookies that Lee can make with three cups of flour. We can set up the proportion $\\frac{18}{2} = \\frac{x}{3}$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{27}$."
