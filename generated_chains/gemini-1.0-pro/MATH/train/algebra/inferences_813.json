At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn engineer invested $\\$10,\\!000$ in a six-month savings certificate that paid a simple annual interest rate of $12\\%$. After six months, she invested the total value of her investment in another six-month certificate. After six more months, the investment was worth $\\$11,\\!130$. If the annual interest rate of the second certificate is $r\\%,$ then what is $r?$",

Therefore, $B = 11130$\n\nSo, $11200 + 0.01r(11200) = 11130$\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{11130 - 11200}{11200 * 0.01} = 10$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$r=10$}. I hope it is correct.**",

Therefore, the investment grows to $10000 \\cdot 1.06 = 10600$.\n\nLet the annual interest rate of the second certificate be $r$ percent.  Then the interest rate for six months is $r/2$, so the investment grows to $10600 \\cdot \\left( 1 + \\frac{r/2}{100} \\right)$.
