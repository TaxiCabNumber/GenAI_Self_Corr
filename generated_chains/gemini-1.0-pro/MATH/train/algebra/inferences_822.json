At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKimberly borrows $1000$ dollars from Lucy, who charged interest of $5\\%$ per month (which compounds monthly). What is the least integer number of months after which Kimberly will owe more than twice as much as she borrowed?",
        "inference": "The amount of money Kimberly owes after $n$ months is $1000(1 + 0.05)^n$. We want to find the least integer $n$ such that \n\n$$1000(1 + 0.05)^n > 2000.$$Solving for $n$, we get\n\n$$(1 + 0.05)^n > 2$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad n > \\log_{1.05} 2 \\approx 14.2093.$$Since $n$ must be an integer, the least integer $n$ such that Kimberly owes more than twice as much as she borrowed is $n = \\boxed{15}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the amount Kimberly owes is multiplied by 1.05 each month, we want the least integer $t$ for which $1.05^t>2$. Trying some integer values of $t$, we find that $\\boxed{15}$ is the smallest that satisfies this condition."
