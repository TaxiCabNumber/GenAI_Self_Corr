At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest integer function, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$, denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\\lfloor3.5\\rfloor=3$, $\\lfloor\\pi\\rfloor=3$ and $\\lfloor -\\pi\\rfloor=-4$. Find the sum of the three smallest positive solutions to $x-\\lfloor x\\rfloor=\\frac1{\\lfloor x\\rfloor}.$ Express your answer as a mixed number.",
