At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the equation $y = |x| - 3$ is translated two units to the left and three units down. What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe graph of $y = |x| - 3$ is translated two units to the left and three units down. This means the new graph is $y = |x+2| - 6$.\n\nThe minimum point of the graph of $y = |x|$ is (0,0). When the graph is translated two units to the left, the minimum point moves to (-2,0). When the graph is translated three units down, the minimum point moves to (-2,-3).\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{(-2,-3)}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $|x|$ is nonnegative, it is minimized when it equals 0, which occurs when $x=0$.  So, the minimum point of the graph of $y=|x| - 3$ is $(0,-3)$.  When we translate this to the left two units and three units down, we get the point $\\boxed{(-2,-6)}$."
