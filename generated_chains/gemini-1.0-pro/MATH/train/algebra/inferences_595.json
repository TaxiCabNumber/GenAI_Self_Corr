        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Academic Academy, to pass an algebra test you must score at least $80\\%$. If there are 35 problems on the test, what is the greatest number you can miss and still pass?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Convert $80\\%$ to a decimal: $80\\% = 0.8$\n2. Multiply $0.8$ by the number of problems: $0.8 \\cdot 35 = 28$\n3. Subtract 28 from 35 to find the number you can miss and still pass: $35 - 28 = 7$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If you must score at least $80 \\%$, then you cannot miss more than $20 \\% = 1/5$ of the problems. $1/5$ of $35$ is equal to $7$, so you can miss at most $\\boxed{7}$ problems and still pass."
