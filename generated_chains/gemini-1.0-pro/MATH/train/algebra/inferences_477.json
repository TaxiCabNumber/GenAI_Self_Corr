At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $m$ and $n$ satisfy $mn=4$ and $m+n=5$. What is $|m-n|$?",
        "inference": "We can write $m=4/n$. So we have the following:\n$$m+n=\\frac{4}{n}+n=5$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n^2+4=5n$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n^2-5n+4=0$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow (n-1)(n-4)=0$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n=1 \\text{ or } n=4$$\n\nIf $n=1$, then $m=4$. So $|m-n|=|4-1|=\\boxed{3}$.\n\nIf $n=4$, then $m=1$. So $|m-n|=|1-4|=\\boxed{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $m$ and $n$ directly and then calculate $|m-n|$ to get our answer. However, doing so is messy, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $(m+n)^2 = m^2 + 2mn + n^2 = 25$. Since $mn=4$, we can subtract $4mn = 16$ to get $$m^2 -2mn +n^2 = 9\\Longrightarrow (m-n)^2=9$$ This implies that $m-n =\\pm3$, so $|m-n|=\\boxed{3}$."
