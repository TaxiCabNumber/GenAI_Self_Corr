What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?",
        "inference": "The graph of $y=h(x-3)$ is obtained by shifting the graph of $y=h(x)$ to the right by 3 units. Thus, the point of intersection will have the same y-coordinate as the point where the graph of $y=h(x)$ intersects the vertical line $x=3$.\n\nFrom the graph, we see that the graph of $y=h(x)$ intersects the vertical line $x=3$ at the point $(3,1)$. Therefore, the point of intersection of the graphs of $y=h(x)$ and $y=h(x-3)$ is $(3+3,1)=\\boxed{(6,1)}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(6,1)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the graphs intersect at $(a,b)$, then we have $$h(a) = h(a-3) \\qquad(= b).$$Thus, $(a,b)$ and $(a-3,b)$ are both on the original graph of $y=h(x)$. Looking for two points on the original graph which are separated by $3$ units horizontally, we find $(-2,3)$ and $(1,3)$. Thus $a-3=-2,$ $a=1,$ and $b=3;$ the graphs of $y=h(x)$ and $y=h(x-3)$ intersect at $(1,3),$ the sum of whose coordinates is $\\boxed{4}$."
