        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA puppy and two cats together weigh 24 pounds. The puppy and the larger cat together weigh exactly twice as much as the smaller cat, and the puppy and the smaller cat together weigh exactly the same as the larger cat. How many pounds does the puppy weigh?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the puppy weighs \"p\" pounds, the larger cat weighs \"c\" pounds, and the smaller cat weighs \"s\" pounds.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. p + c + s = 24 (Total weight of puppy and cats)\n\n2. p + c = 2s (Puppy and larger cat together weigh twice as much as the smaller cat)\n\n3. p + s = c (Puppy and smaller cat together weigh the same as the larger cat)\n\nSubstituting equation 3 into equation 1, we get:\n\np + s + c = 24\np + c = 24 - s\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2, we get:\n\np + c = 2s\n24 - s = 2s\n3s = 24\ns = 8\n\nNow that we know the weight of the smaller cat is 8 pounds, we can substitute it back into equation 3 to find the weight of the larger cat:\n\np + 8 = c\nc = p + 8\n\nFinally, we can substitute the expressions for s and c into equation 1 to find the weight of the puppy:\n\np + (p + 8) + 8 = 24\n2p + 16 = 24\n2p = 8\n**p = 4**\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the weight of the puppy be $a$, the weight of the smaller cat be $b$, and the weight of the larger cat be $c$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=24\\\\\na+c&=2b\\\\\na+b&=c\n\\end{align*} From Equation (2), we have $a=2b-c$. Substituting that into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b+c=24 \\Rightarrow b=8\n\\end{align*} Substituting $a=2b-c$ into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, we have \\begin{align*}\n(2b-c)+b&=c \\Rightarrow 3b=2c\n\\end{align*} Since $b=8$, $c=\\frac{3}{2}b=12$. Finally, substituting the values of $b$ and $c$ into Equation (1) to solve for $a$, we have $a+8+12=24$, or $a=4$. Thus, the puppy weighs $\\boxed{4}$ pounds."
