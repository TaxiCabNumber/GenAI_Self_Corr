At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the arithmetic sequence  $1$, $4$, $7$, $10$, $13$, $\\ldots$.  Find the $15^{\\text{th}}$ term in the sequence.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe first term is $1$. The common difference is $4-1=7-4=10-7=3$. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n=a_1+(n-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference. So, the 15th term is $a_{15}=1+(15-1)3=1+42=\\boxed{43}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{43}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The first term is 1, and the common difference is 3.  Therefore, to get to the $15^\\text{th}$ term, we must add 3 to the first term 14 times, to get $1+ 3(14) = \\boxed{43}$."
