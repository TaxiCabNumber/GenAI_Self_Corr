He adds 250 even numbers in total, so his sum is 250 x 502 = 125,500.\n\nJulie adds up all the integers from 1 to 250, inclusive, so the last integer she adds is 250, and the first integer she adds is 1. The sum of these two numbers is 251. She adds 250 integers in total, so her sum is 250 x 251 = 62,750.\n\nTherefore, Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is 125,500 / 62,750 = 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that if we factor out a 2, then Sean's sum is $2 + 4 + \\cdots + 500 = 2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)$. Julie's sum is $1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250$. So Sean's sum divided by Julie's sum is $$\n\\frac{2(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)}{(1 + 2 + \\cdots + 250)} = \\boxed{2}.\n$$"
