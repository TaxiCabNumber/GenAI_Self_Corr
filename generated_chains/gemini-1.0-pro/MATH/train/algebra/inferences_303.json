        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe denominator of a fraction is 7 less than 3 times the numerator.  If the fraction is equivalent to $2/5$, what is the numerator of the fraction?",
        "inference": "Let \\( x \\) be the numerator of the fraction.\nThen the denominator is \\( 3x - 7\\).\nSince the fraction is equivalent to \\( 2/5\\), we have:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{3x-7} = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$5x = 2(3x-7)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$5x = 6x - 14$$\n\nSubtracting \\( 6x \\) from both sides, we get:\n\n$$-x = -14$$\n\nDividing both sides by \\( -1 \\), we get:\n\n$$x = 14$$\n\nTherefore, the numerator of the fraction is \\( \\boxed{14}.\\)\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{14}\\).

        "ground_truth": "We let the numerator be $x$, so the denominator is $3x-7$.  Because the fraction equals $2/5$, we have $x/(3x-7) = 2/5$.  Multiplying both sides by $5(3x-7)$ (or cross-multiplying) gives $5x = 2(3x-7)$.  Expanding the right side gives $5x = 6x - 14$.  Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-x = -14$, so we find $x = \\boxed{14}$."
