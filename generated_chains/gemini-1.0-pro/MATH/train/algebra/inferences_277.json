        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let \\(x\\) be the length of the rectangular pen. Then the width is \\(40-2x\\), since the perimeter is 40 feet.\n\n**Step 2:** The area of the rectangular pen is \\(A = x(40-2x) = 40x - 2x^2\\).\n\n**Step 3:** To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to 0:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dx} = 40 - 4x = 0$$\n\n**Step 4:** Solving for \\(x\\), we get \\(x = 10\\).\n\n**Step 5:** Substituting \\(x = 10\\) back into the area equation, we get the maximum area:\n$$A = 40(10) - 2(10)^2 = 400 - 200 = 200 \\text{ square feet}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{200}\\).

        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square."
