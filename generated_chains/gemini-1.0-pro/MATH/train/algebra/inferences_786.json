At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe function $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\\lfloor 5.67\\rfloor = 5$, $\\lfloor -\\tfrac 14\\rfloor = -1$, and $\\lfloor 8\\rfloor = 8$.\n\nWhat is the range of the function $$f(x) = \\lfloor x\\rfloor - x~?$$Express your answer in interval notation.",
