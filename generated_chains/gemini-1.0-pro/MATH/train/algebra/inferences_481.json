At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 5th term of an arithmetic sequence of 20 terms with first and last terms of 2 and 59, respectively?",
        "inference": "We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n$$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d$$\n\nwhere a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.\n\nWe know that the first term is 2 and the last term (20th term) is 59, so we can write the following equation:\n\n$$59 = 2 + (20 - 1) * d$$\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\n$$d = 3$$\n\nNow that we know the common difference, we can find the 5th term using the formula above:\n\n$$a_5 = 2 + (5 - 1) * 3$$\n\n$$a_5 = 2 + 4 * 3$$\n\n$$a_5 = 2 + 12$$\n\n$$a_5 = 14$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$14$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From the first term to the 20th term, the common difference is added 19 times.  Therefore, the common difference for the arithmetic sequence is $(59-2)/19=3$.  The fifth term is $2+3\\cdot(5-1)=\\boxed{14}$."
