        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent basketball game, Shenille attempted only three-point shots and two-point shots.  She was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots and $30\\%$ of her two-point shots.  Shenille attempted $30$ shots.  How many points did she score?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the number of successful three-point shots.\n$20\\%$ of $30$ shots = $0.20 \\times 30 = 6$ three-point shots.\n\n2. Determine the number of successful two-point shots.\n$30\\%$ of $30$ shots = $0.30 \\times 30 = 9$ two-point shots.\n\n3. Calculate Shenille's total points.\nTotal points = (Points from three-point shots) + (Points from two-point shots)\n= $3 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 9$\n= $18 + 18$\n= $36$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$.  We know that $x+y=30$.   We need to evaluate $(0.2\\cdot3)x +(0.3\\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\\%$ of them.\n\nSimplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$.  Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \\boxed{18}$."
