So we can write an equation:\n\n$$Mickey's \\; age = 300\\% \\times Jerry's \\; age - 4$$\n\n$$14 = 300\\% \\times x - 4$$\n\n$$14 + 4 = 300\\% \\times x$$\n\n$$18 = 300\\% \\times x$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $M$ and $J$ be the ages of Mickey and Jerry, respectively.  Then, $300\\%$ of Jerry's age is $3J$.  Since Mickey's age is 4 years less than $300\\%$ of Jerry's age, we have $M=3J - 4$.  We are given that $M = 14$, so $14 = 3J-4$.  Adding 4 to both sides gives $18 = 3J$, so $J=6$ and Jerry is $\\boxed{6}$ years old."
