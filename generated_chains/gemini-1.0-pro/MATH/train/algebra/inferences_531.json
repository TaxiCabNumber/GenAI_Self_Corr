At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nThe function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$\n\n**Step 1:** The denominator $x^2$ can never be $0$, so the function is defined for all $x \n\\ne 0$.\n\n**Step 2:** The range of the function is the set of all possible output values. Since the \ndenominator is always positive, the function is always positive.\n\n**Step 3:** The function is increasing on the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$ and decreasing on the \ninterval $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 4:** Therefore, the range of the function is $(0,\\ \\infty)$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$(0, \\infty)$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
