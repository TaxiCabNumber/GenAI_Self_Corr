At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation $2x + y = 6$. What is the area of the region, in square units?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe line $2x + y = 6$ intersects the $y$-axis at $(0, 6)$ and the $x$-axis at $(3, 0)$. The vertices of the triangle are $(0, 0), (3, 0)$, and $(0, 6)$.\n\nThe base of the triangle is 3, and the height is 6, so the area is:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{9}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}.

        "ground_truth": "To start, use the equation to solve for the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the line.  Letting $x$ equal 0, the $y$-intercept is 6.  Letting $y$ equal 0, we find that $2x=6$ so the $x$-intercept is 3.  Using the intercepts, we can graph the line as shown: [asy]size(100,0);\nfill((0,0)--(0,6)--(3,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\nadd(grid(5,8));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"\",(0,8),N);\ndraw((0,6)--(3,0),blue,Arrows);[/asy] We wish to find the area of the shaded region.  This is a right triangle with one base of length 3, and one of length 6.  Therefore, the area is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3\\cdot 6=\\boxed{9}$."
