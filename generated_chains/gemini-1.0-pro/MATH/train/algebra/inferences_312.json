At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Since $y$ is not defined when $2x+3=0$, we have $2x=-3$ and $x=-\\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the unattainable value of $y$ is the value that corresponds to $x=-\\frac{3}{2}$. Substituting $x=-\\frac{3}{2}$ into $y=\\frac{1-x}{2x+3}$, we get $y=\\frac{1-\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}{2\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)+3}=\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}}{-3+3}=\\frac{5}{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $y = \\frac{1 - x}{2x + 3}$, then $1-x=(2x+3)y=2xy+3y$. We can rearrange to $1-3y=x(2y+1)$. When $2y+1=0$ or $y=-\\frac12$, the left hand side is nonzero while the right hand side is zero, so the value $y = \\boxed{-\\frac12}$ is unattainable."
