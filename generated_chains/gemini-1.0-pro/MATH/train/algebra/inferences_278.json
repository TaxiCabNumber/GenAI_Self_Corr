        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the product of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $|4x|+3=35$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get $|4x|=32$.\n\n**Step 2:** Since $|4x|$ is the absolute value of $4x$, it must be nonnegative. Therefore, $4x$ must be either $32$ or $-32$.\n\n**Step 3:** If $4x=32$, then $x=8$.\n\n**Step 4:** If $4x=-32$, then $x=-8$.\n\n**Step 5:** The product of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation is $8\\times(-8)=-64$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-64}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, in order to isolate the absolute value. This gives us $|4x|=35-3=32$, which we can split into two separate cases: $4x=32$ and $4x=-32$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\\frac{32}{4}=8$. For the second case, we would get $x=-\\frac{32}{4}=-8$. Therefore, the two values of $x$ that satisfy the initial equation are $x=8$ and $x=-8$. Since the problem asks for the product of these values, our solution is $(8)(-8)=\\boxed{-64}$."
