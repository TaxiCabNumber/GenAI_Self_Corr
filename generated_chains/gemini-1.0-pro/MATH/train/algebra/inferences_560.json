At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA woman labels the squares of a very large chessboard $1$ through $64$. On each square $k$, the woman puts $2^k$ grains of rice. How many more grains of rice are placed on the $10^{th}$ square than on the first $8$ squares combined?",
        "inference": "The number of grains of rice on the $10^{th}$ square is $2^{10} = 1024$.\n\nThe number of grains of rice on the first $8$ squares combined is $2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 511$.\n\nThe number of more grains of rice placed on the $10^{th}$ square than on the first $8$ squares combined is $1024 - 511 = 513$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{513}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $10^{th}$ square receives $2^{10}=1024$ grains. The first $8$ squares receive $2+2^2+\\dots+2^8=2\\left(\\frac{2^8-1}{2-1}\\right)=2(256-1)=2(255)=510$. Thus the $10^{th}$ square receives $1024-510=\\boxed{514}$ more grains than the first $8$ combined."
