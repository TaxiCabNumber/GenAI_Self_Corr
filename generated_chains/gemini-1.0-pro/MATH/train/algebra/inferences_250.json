At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe is studying a bacteria population.  There are 20 bacteria present at 3:00 p.m. and the population doubles every 3 minutes.  Assuming none of the bacteria die, how many bacteria are present at 3:15 p.m. the same day?",
        "inference": "At 3:03 p.m. there are $20 \\times 2 = 40$ bacteria.\nAt 3:06 p.m. there are $40 \\times 2 = 80$ bacteria.\nAt 3:09 p.m. there are $80 \\times 2 = 160$ bacteria.\nAt 3:12 p.m. there are $160 \\times 2 = 320$ bacteria.\nAt 3:15 p.m. there are $320 \\times 2 = 640$ bacteria.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$640$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are five 3-minute increments between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm, so the bacteria doubles 5 times, so the final population is $2^5 = 32$ times the initial population.  Hence at 3:15 pm there are $20 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{640}$ bacteria."
