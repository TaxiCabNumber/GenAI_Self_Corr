        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the slope of the line $2y = -3x + 6$?",
        "inference": "The equation of a line is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nTo get the equation in this form, we need to solve for $y$.\n\n$$2y = -3x + 6$$\n\n$$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 3$$\n\nSo the slope is $-\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 3$, which is in slope-intercept form.  The coefficient of $x$ is the desired slope, $\\boxed{-\\frac32}$."
