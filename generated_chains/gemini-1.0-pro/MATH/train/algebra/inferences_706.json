At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sequence $6075, 2025, 675 \\ldots$, is made by repeatedly dividing by 3. How many integers are in this sequence?",

This means that the sequence will continue until the last integer is smaller than 1. To find the number of integers in the sequence, we need to find the smallest integer that is smaller than 1 when divided by 3. The smallest integer that is smaller than 1 when divided by 3 is 1/3. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers in the sequence.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
