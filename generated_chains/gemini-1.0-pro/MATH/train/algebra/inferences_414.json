At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe decimal $0.76$ is equal to the fraction $\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$, where $b$ is a positive integer. What is the value of $b$?",
        "inference": "Multiply the decimal by 100, making it 76. Multiply the fraction by 100 to get $\\frac{400b+1900}{600b+1100}$. Since the numerator and denominator are both divisible by 100, we get $\\frac{4b+19}{6b+11}$, where $b$ is a positive integer. In order for the decimal to be equal to the fraction, the numerator and denominator of the fraction must match the numerator and denominator of the decimal. Therefore $4b+19=76$ and $6b+11=100$. Solving for $b$ in the first equation, we get $b=\\frac{57}{4}$. Solving for $b$ in the second equation, we get $b=\\frac{89}{6}$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, we can see that $b=\\boxed{14}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct.",
