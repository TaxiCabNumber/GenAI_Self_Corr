At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-10x-10$ and $y=x^2-4x+6$. Find all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
        "inference": "Step 1: Set the two equations equal to each other. \\begin{align*}\n2x^2-10x-10&=x^2-4x+6\\\\\nx^2-6x-16&=0\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 2: Factor the quadratic equation. \\begin{align*}\n(x-8)(x+2)&=0\\\\\nx-8&=0\\text{ or }x+2&=0\\\\\nx&=8\\text{ or }x&=-2\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 3: Find the corresponding $y$-coordinates for each $x$-coordinate. When $x=8$, $y=2(8)^2-10(8)-10=2(64)-80-10=128-90=\\boxed{38}$. When $x=-2$, $y=2(-2)^2-10(-2)-10=2(4)+20-10=8+10=\\boxed{18}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-2,18;8,38}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-10x-10=x^2-4x+6$. Combine like terms to get $x^2-6x=16$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.\n\nSo we have $x-3=\\pm5$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\\boxed{(8,38)}$."
