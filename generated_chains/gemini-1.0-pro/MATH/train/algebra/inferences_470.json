At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2-4x+7=19$ has two solutions, $a$ and $b$, with $a\\geq b$. What is the value of $2a+b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe have $x^2-4x+7=19$, so $x^2-4x-12=0$. Factoring, we get $(x-6)(x+2)=0$, so $x=6$ or $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we have $a=6$ and $b=-2$. Therefore, $2a+b=2(6)+(-2)=12-2=\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16$, which indicates that the fastest way to solve this problem would be to complete the square. Thus, we have $(x-2)^2=16$, or $x-2=\\pm4$, or $x=6$ and $x=-2$. Since $a\\geq b$, we now know that $a=6$ and $b=-2$, so $2a+b=2(6)-2=\\boxed{10}$."
