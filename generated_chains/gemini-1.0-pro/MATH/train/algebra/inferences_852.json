        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSusie Q has 1000 dollars to invest.  She invests some of the money at the Pretty Penny Bank, which compounds annually at 3 percent.  She invests the rest of the money at the Five and Dime Bank, which compounds annually at 5 percent.  After two years, Susie has a total of $\\$1090.02$.  How much did Susie Q originally invest at the Pretty Penny Bank, in dollars?",
        "inference": "Let x be the amount Susie Q invested at the Pretty Penny Bank. \nThen, 1000-x is the amount she invested at the Five and Dime Bank.\n\nAfter two years, the amount in the Pretty Penny Bank will be x * (1 + (3/100))^2 = 1.0609 * x, \nand the amount in the Five and Dime Bank will be (1000-x) * (1 + (5/100))^2 = 1.1025 * (1000-x)\n\nSince the total amount after two years is $1090.02, we have:\n\n1.0609 * x + 1.1025 * (1000 - x) = 1090.02\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.0416 * x = 1090.02 - 1102.50\n0.0416 * x = -12.48\nx = -12.48 / 0.0416\nx = -300\n\nSince Susie Q cannot invest a negative amount of money, this is not a valid solution. Therefore, the problem has no solution.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{No\\ Solution}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of dollars Susie Q invested at the Pretty Penny Bank.  Then she invested $1000 - x$ at the Five and Dime Bank.  After two years, her account at the Pretty Penny Bank has grown to $x \\cdot 1.03^2$, and her account at the Five and Dime Bank has grown to $(1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2$.  Therefore, \\[x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1090.02.\\]We see that $x \\cdot 1.03^2 + (1000 - x) \\cdot 1.05^2 = 1.0609x + 1102.5 - 1.1025x = 1102.5 - 0.0416x$, so \\[1102.5 - 0.0416x = 1090.02.\\]Then \\[x = \\frac{1102.5 - 1090.02}{0.0416} = \\boxed{300}.\\]"
