        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe line segment joining $(1,3)$ to $(5,7)$ has slope $\\frac{7-3}{5-1}=\\frac{4}{4}=1$.\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of this line segment has slope $-1$.\nSince the perpendicular bisector passes through the midpoint $(3,5)$, its equation is $y-5=-1(x-3)$, which simplifies to $y=-x+8$.\nTherefore, $b=8$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$**",
