        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area of the circle defined by $x^2-6x +y^2-14y +33=0$ that lies beneath the line $y=7$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nComplete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n$$(x^2-6x +9) + (y^2-14y +49) =33-9-49=-25$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow (x-3)^2 + (y-7)^2 =25$$\n\nSo the circle has **radius 5** and **center at (3,7)**. The part of the circle that lies beneath the line \\(y=7\\) is a **semicircle of radius 5**, so its area is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\pi (5)^2 = \\frac{25\\pi}{2}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{25\\pi}{2}}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Add $(-6/2)^2$ and $(-14/2)^2$ to both sides of the equation to get \\[\n(x^2-6x +9) +(y^2-14y +49)=25,\n\\] which in turn can be rewritten as $(x-3)^2 +(y-7)^2 =5^2$.  The center of this circle is $(3,7)$, so the line $y=7$ passes through the center of the circle.  Hence, the area of the circle that lies below $y=7$ is half the area of the circle.  The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{25} = 5$, so the circle has area $25\\pi$.  Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\frac{25\\pi}{2}}$."
