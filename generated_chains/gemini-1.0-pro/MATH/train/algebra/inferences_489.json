        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation $8x^2+15x+c=0$ is $15^2-4\\cdot8\\cdot c=225-32c$. For the quadratic equation to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, we have the inequality $225-32c\\ge0$. Solving this inequality for $c$, we get $c\\le\\frac{225}{32}=\\frac{75}{16}$. Since $c$ is a positive integer, the only possible values of $c$ are $\\boxed{1,2}$. Therefore, the product of all positive integer values of $c$ such that $8x^2+15x+c=0$ has two real roots is $1\\cdot2=\\boxed{2}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}15^2-4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot c &> 0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 225-32c &> 0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad c&< \\frac{225}{32}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{225}{32}$ is 7.
