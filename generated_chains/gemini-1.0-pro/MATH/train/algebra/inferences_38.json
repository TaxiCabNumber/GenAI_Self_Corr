At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has three sides of the following side lengths: $7$, $10$, and $x^2$. What are all of the positive integer values of $x$ such that the triangle exists? Separate your answers using commas and express them in increasing order.",
        "inference": "The triangle inequality theorem states that for a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nFor the first two sides, we have $7 + 10 > x^2$.\nFor the second and third sides, we have $10 + x^2 > 7$.\nFor the first and third sides, we have $7 + x^2 > 10$.\n\nSolving these inequalities, we get $x^2 < 17$, $x^2 > -3$, and $x^2 > 3$.\n\nThe only positive integer values of $x$ that satisfy all three inequalities are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2, 3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \\to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \\to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \\to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$. Therefore, possible values for $x$ are $\\boxed{2, 3, \\text{ and } 4}$."
