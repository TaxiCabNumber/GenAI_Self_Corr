At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo positive integers differ by 6 and their product is 135. What is the larger integer?",
        "inference": "Let the smaller integer be $x$. Then the larger integer is $x+6$. Their product is $x(x+6)=135$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^2+6x=135$. Rewriting in standard quadratic form, we have $x^2+6x-135=0$. Factoring, we get $(x+15)(x-9)=0$. Therefore, $x=9$ or $x=-15$. Since $x$ is positive, we have $x=9$. Therefore, the larger integer is $x+6=\\boxed{15}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
