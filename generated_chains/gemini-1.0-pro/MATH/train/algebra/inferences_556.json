At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJulie works for 48 hours per week for 12 weeks during the summer, making $\\$5000$. If she works for 48 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$5000$, how many hours per week must she work?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate Julie's hourly rate.**\n\nHourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours worked\nHourly rate = $5000 / (48 hours/week * 12 weeks)\nHourly rate = $5000 / 576 hours\nHourly rate = $8.68 per hour\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours needed to make $\\$5000 at the same rate.**\n\nHours needed = Earnings / Hourly rate\nHours needed = $5000 / $8.68 per hour\nHours needed = 576 hours\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of hours per week Julie must work.**\n\nHours per week = Total hours needed / Number of weeks\nHours per week = 576 hours / 48 weeks\nHours per week = 12 hours\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 4 times as many weeks, she can work 4 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 48 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
