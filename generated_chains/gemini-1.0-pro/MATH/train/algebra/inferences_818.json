        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA lattice point in the $x,y$-plane is a point both of whose coordinates are integers (not necessarily positive).  How many lattice points lie on the graph of the equation $x^2-y^2=47$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can rewrite the equation as $x^2=y^2+47$.  If $x$ and $y$ are integers, then $y^2$ is also an integer.  Since $y^2\\geq 0$, we have $y^2\\leq 47$, so $y^2$ can be one of the integers $0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49$.  For each of these values of $y^2$, the corresponding value of $x^2$ is $47+y^2$.  Since $x$ is an integer, we must have $47+y^2$ a perfect square.  The only perfect squares among these values are $47+0=47$, $47+1=48$, $47+4=51$, and $47+9=56$.  Thus, $(x,y)$ can be one of the following pairs: $(7,0)$, $(8,1)$, $(\\sqrt{51},2)$, and $(8\\sqrt{7},3)$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=47$.  Both factors are integers.  The only pairs of factors of $47$ are $(47,1)$ and $(-47,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=47$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-47$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=47$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-47$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the graph."
