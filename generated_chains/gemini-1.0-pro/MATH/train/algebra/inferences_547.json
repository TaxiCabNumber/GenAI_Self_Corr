        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the equation $y=\\frac{x-1}{x^2+6x-7}$ have?",
        "inference": "The equation has vertical asymptotes at the values of x that make the denominator equal to zero. So we need to solve the equation $x^2+6x-7=0$.\nFactoring the quadratic, we get: $(x+7)(x-1)=0$. So the vertical asymptotes are at $x=-7$ and $x=1$.\n**Final Answer: $2$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes $\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x+7)}$. So the denominator equals $0$ when $x=1$ and $x=-7$. However, since the term $x-1$ also exists in the numerator and is of the same degree as in the denominator, $x=1$ is not a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the equation has only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote at $x=-7$."
