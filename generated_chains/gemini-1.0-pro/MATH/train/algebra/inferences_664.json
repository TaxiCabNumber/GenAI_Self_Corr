At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.  Find $a+b$.",

        "ground_truth": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$."
