At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{666}$. Then $100x = 66.\\overline{666}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $99x = 66$, so $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNow let $y = 1.\\overline{333}$. Then $10y = 13.\\overline{333}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $9y = 12$, so $y = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{0.\\overline{666}}{1.\\overline{333}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.

        "ground_truth": "We might recognize the top as $\\frac{2}{3}$, and the bottom as $\\frac{4}{3}$, thereby giving you a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$.  If not, call the numerator $x$.  Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \\frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction."
