At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the squares of two positive integers is 90. The product of the two integers is 27. What is the sum of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x^2+y^2=90$ and $xy=27$. We can simplify the first equation as $y^2=90-x^2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $x(90-x^2)=27$. Expanding and rearranging, we get $x^3-90x+27=0$. This factors as $(x-3)(x^2+3x-9)=0$. Since $x$ is positive, we can discard the first factor. Solving the second factor, we get $x=\\frac{-3\\pm\\sqrt{9+36}}{2}=\\frac{-3\\pm3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Substituting these values of $x$ into $y^2=90-x^2$, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{30}$. Since $y$ is also positive, we can discard the negative value. Therefore, the two integers are $x=\\frac{-3+3\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $y=\\sqrt{30}$. The sum of these two integers is $x+y=\\frac{-3+3\\sqrt{5}}{2}+\\sqrt{30}=\\frac{-3+3\\sqrt{5}+2\\sqrt{30}}{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{-3+3\\sqrt{5}+2\\sqrt{30}}{2}}$ I hope it is correct.",
