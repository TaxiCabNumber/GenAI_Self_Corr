        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends. However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. You have less than 100 gold coins. What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?",
        "inference": "First, you divide the coins as equally as possible, giving an equal amount to each friend. If there is an odd number of coins left over, then one person gets one more coin than the others. In this case, the extra coin is given to one of the 11 friends. So, to give two people an extra coin, you need to have an odd number of coins left over. \n\nTherefore, we need to make 11 equal piles of coins, with an odd number of coins left over. The smallest odd number that works is 3. Therefore, you could have 11 equal piles of 3 coins, with 3 coins left over, for a total of 38 coins. \n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$38$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$."
