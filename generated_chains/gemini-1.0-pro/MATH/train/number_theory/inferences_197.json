At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAbigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market. If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?",
        "inference": "Total number of eggs: 37 + 49 + 14 = 100\n\nNumber of full cartons that can be sold: 100 / 12 = 8 cartons\n\nTotal number of eggs in 8 cartons: 8 * 12 = 96\n\nNumber of eggs left over: 100 - 96 = **4**\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$."
