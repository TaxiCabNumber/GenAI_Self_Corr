At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaniel has exactly $20$ pieces of candy. He has to divide them equally among his $3$ sisters. What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
        "inference": "Daniel has $20$ pieces of candy and he wants to divide the candies equally among $3$ of his sisters. Since $20$ is not divisible by $3$, he first takes out $r$ pieces where $r<20$ is the remainder when $20$ is divided by $3$. Thus,\n$$20= 3k+r, \\quad 0\\le r<3$$\nSolving for $r$, we obtain\n$$r=1$$\nNow, since he wants to divide the candies equally it means that all the three sisters should have equal candies. Thus, he can distribute only $\\frac{20-1}{3}=6$ pieces to each of his sisters.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces."
