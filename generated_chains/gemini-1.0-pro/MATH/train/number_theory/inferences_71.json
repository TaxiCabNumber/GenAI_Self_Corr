At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a certain natural number $n$, $n^2$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, and $n^3$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. What remainder does $n$ give when divided by 5?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** We can write $n^2$ and $n^3$ in terms of 5 as follows:\n\n$$n^2 = 5k + 4$$\n\n$$n^3 = 5l + 2$$\n\n**Step 2:** We can multiply the first equation by $n$ to get:\n\n$$n^3 = 5nk + 4n$$\n\n**Step 3:** We can then subtract the second equation from the third equation to get:\n\n$$4n = 5(nk - l)$$\n\n**Step 4:** Since $n$ is a natural number, $nk - l$ must also be a natural number. This means that $5$ divides $nk - l$.\n\n**Step 5:** Therefore, $5$ also divides $4n$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5.  From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$.  Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5.  Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition. Therefore, we may assume that $0\\leq n <5$.  Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5."
