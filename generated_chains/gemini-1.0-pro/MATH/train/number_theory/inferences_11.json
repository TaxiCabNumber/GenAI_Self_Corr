At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the seven-digit number $854n526$ is divisible by $11$, what is $n$?",
        "inference": "When a number is divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the even places and the sum of the digits in the odd places must be divisible by 11.\n\nThe sum of the digits in the even places is $8 + 4 + 2 = 14$.\n\nThe sum of the digits in the odd places is $5 + n + 6 = n + 11$.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the digits in the even places and the sum of the digits in the odd places is $14 - (n + 11) = 3 - n$.\n\nSince $3 - n$ must be divisible by 11, we have $3 - n = 11k$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 3 - 11k$.\n\nSince $n$ is a digit, it must be an integer between 0 and 9. The only possible value of $k$ that gives us an integer value of $n$ is $k = 0$, which gives us $n = 3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$."
