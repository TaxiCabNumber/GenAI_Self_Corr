At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
        "inference": "Since $y$ is a prime number less than 10, $y$ can be 2,3,5 or 7.\nIf $y=2$, then $10x+y$ is even, and hence $m$ is even. But $m$ is odd since it is the product of three odd prime factors. Thus $y$ cannot be equal to 2.\nIf $y=3$, then $10x+y=10x+3$ is congruent to $x+3$ modulo $3$. Since $x$ is a prime number less than 10, $x$ is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 3. Thus $10x+3$ is congruent to 4 or 8 modulo 3, and hence $10x+3$ is not a prime number. Thus $y$ cannot be equal to 3.\nIf $y=5$, then $10x+y=10x+5$ is congruent to $x+5$ modulo $5$. Since $x$ is a prime number less than 10, $x$ is congruent to 1,3,7 or 9 modulo 5. Thus $10x+5$ is congruent to 6,8,2 or 4 modulo 5, and hence $10x+5$ is not a prime number. Thus $y$ cannot be equal to 5.\nThus $y$ must be equal to 7. Then $10x+y=10x+7$. Since $10x+7$ is a prime number, $x$ must be equal to 1. Thus $m=x\\cdot y\\cdot (10x+y)=1\\cdot 7\\cdot 17=\\boxed{119}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{119}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$."
