At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer that is a divisor of \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\]for all positive even integers $n$?",
        "inference": "Since $n$ is even, $n+1$ is odd.  Because any factor of the product must be a divisor of either $n+1$ or $n+2$, any common divisor of the product must be odd.  The only odd factor common to all 5 factors of the product is $1$, so the largest integer that is a divisor of the product for all positive even integers $n$ is $1$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$."
