At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
        "inference": "Since $11^4$ in base $10$ has 4 digits, $11^4$ in base $b$ has at most $4$ digits.  Thus, the sum of its digits is at most $4(b-1)$.  We want the largest $b$ such that $4(b-1)<2^4=16$.  Solving this inequality, we get $4(b-1)<16$, so $b-1<4$, so $b<5$.  Thus, the largest base $b$ is $b=\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$."
