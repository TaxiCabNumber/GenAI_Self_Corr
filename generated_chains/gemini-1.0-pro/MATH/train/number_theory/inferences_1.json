        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nPrime factorization of the product,\n\n$$x=2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9=2^2\\times3^3\\times2^8\\times5^5\\times2^6\\times3^6\\times7^7\\times2^8\\times3^9$$\n\n$$=2^{16}\\times3^{18}\\times5^5\\times7^7$$\n\n$$=2^{14}\\times3^{16}\\times2^2\\times3^2\\times5^5\\times7^7$$\n\n$$=2^{16}\\times3^{18}\\times5^5\\times7^7$$\n\nThe smallest prime number which has not been taken as a power of 2 or 3 is 5. So we can take 5, 5 times or 5 twice times. So the smallest positive integer which, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square is $5^2$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{25}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
