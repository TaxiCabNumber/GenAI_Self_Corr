The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n",

The smallest positive multiple of $100$ is $100$. Thus, $23n - 50m = 100$.

The only positive integer less than $23$ that is relatively prime to $23$ is $1$. Thus, $2 + m = 1$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = -1$. However, $m$ is a positive integer.
