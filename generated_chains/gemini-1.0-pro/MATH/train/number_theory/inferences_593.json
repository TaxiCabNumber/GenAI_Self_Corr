At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that\n\\begin{eqnarray*}&(1)& x\\text{ and }y\\text{ are both integers between 100 and 999, inclusive;}\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\\\     &(2)& y\\text{ is the number formed by reversing the digits of }x\\text{; and}\\\\     &(3)& z=|x-y|. \\end{eqnarray*}\nHow many distinct values of $z$ are possible?\n",

Therefore, $y \\leq x$.\nThus $z=x-y \\ge 0$.  Since $z$ is an integer, we have $z\\ge 0$.\nHence $0 \\le z \\le x$.\nSince $x$ is a 3-digit number, we have $100 \\le x \\le 999$, so $0 \\le z \\le 999$.\nSince $z$ is an integer, the number of distinct values of $z$ is $1000$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1000}.$ I hope it is correct.",

From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way)."
