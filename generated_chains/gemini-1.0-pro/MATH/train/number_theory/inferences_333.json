At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes exactly 74 colored beads on a string to make a necklace. The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Divide the number of beads by the number of colors in the pattern.\n74 / 5 = 14 R 4\n\n**Step 2:** The remainder tells us the number of beads that are in the partial pattern at the end of the necklace.\n4\n\n**Step 3:** Refer to the pattern to identify the color of the bead that corresponds to the remainder.\nThe bead that corresponds to the remainder of 4 is blue.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{Blue}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$."
