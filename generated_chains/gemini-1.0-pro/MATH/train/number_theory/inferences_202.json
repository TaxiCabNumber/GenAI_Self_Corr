At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat integer $n$ satisfies $0\\le n<9$ and $$-1111\\equiv n\\pmod 9~?$$",
        "inference": "$$-1111\\equiv n\\pmod 9 \\iff -1111-9k=n \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.$$\n\nSince $-1111\\equiv 0\\pmod 9$, we have $-1111-9k=0$ for $k=0$, so $n=0$. Since $n$ is an integer between 0 and 9, we have $n=\\boxed{0}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct."
