        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a unique two-digit positive integer $t$ for which the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$.\n\nWhat is $t$?",
        "inference": "Since the last two digits of $11\\cdot t$ are $36$, we have $11\\cdot t\\equiv 36\\pmod{100}$.\n\nSince $11\\cdot4\\equiv 44\\pmod{100}$ and $11\\cdot9\\equiv 99\\pmod{100}$, we have $11\\cdot t\\equiv 44\\pmod{100}$ or $11\\cdot t\\equiv 99\\pmod{100}$.\n\nSince $t$ is a two-digit positive integer, we have $t>9$.\n\nTherefore, $11\\cdot t\\equiv 44\\pmod{100}$ and $t=4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$."
