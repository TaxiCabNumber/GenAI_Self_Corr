At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Mersenne prime is defined to be a prime number of the form $2^n - 1$, where $n$ must itself be a prime. For example, since $2^3 - 1 = 7$, and 3 is a prime number, 7 is a Mersenne prime. What is the largest Mersenne prime less than 200?",
        "inference": "The Mersenne primes less than 200 are:\n$$2^2 - 1 = 3$$\n$$2^3 - 1 = 7$$\n$$2^5 - 1 = 31$$\n$$2^7 - 1 = 127$$\nThe largest of these is $127$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{127}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest Mersenne Prime less than 200 is $2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = \\boxed{127}$. The next possible Mersenne Prime, $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$, is much too large (and is not prime)."
