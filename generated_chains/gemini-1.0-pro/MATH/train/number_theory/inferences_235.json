At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $120$, and the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, then what is their greatest common divisor?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the GCF**\n\nThe GCF of $A$ and $B$ can be found using the formula:\n\n```\nGCF(A, B) = LCM(A, B) / (A * B)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Find the Products of the Numbers**\n\nWe know that $LCM(A, B) = 120$. We also know that $A:B = 3:4$. This means that $A = 3x$ and $B = 4x$ for some integer $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Products into the Formula**\n\nSubstituting $A = 3x$ and $B = 4x$ into the formula, we get:\n\n```\nGCF(3x, 4x) = 120 / (3x * 4x) = 120 / 12x^2 = 10/x^2\n```\n\n**Step 4: Find the Value of x**\n\nWe need to find the value of $x$ that makes $10/x^2$ an integer. The only integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the GCF**\n\nSubstituting $x = 1$ into the expression for the GCF, we get:\n\n```\nGCF(3x, 4x) = 10/x^2 = 10/1^2 = 10\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$10$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=4k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $120k=(3k)(4k),$ which implies $k=120/12=\\boxed{10}$."
