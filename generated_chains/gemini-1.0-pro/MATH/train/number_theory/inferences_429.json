I hope it is correct.'\nThe marching band has more than 100 members but fewer than 200 members. When they line up in rows of 4 there is one extra person; when they line up in rows of 5 there are two extra people; and when they line up in rows of 7 there are three extra people. How many members are in the marching band?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let's represent the number of members in the band as \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 2**: We know that when they line up in rows of 4, there is one extra person. So, we can write:\n\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$$\n\n**Step 3**: Similarly, we can write the other two conditions:\n\n$$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$$\n\n$$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Step 4**: We need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies all three of these conditions. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for this. By CRT, we have:\n\n$$x \\equiv a_1 \\pmod{m_1}, x \\equiv a_2 \\pmod{m_2}, \\dots, x \\equiv a_n \\pmod{m_n}$$\n\nwhere \\(m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n\\) are pairwise co-prime and \\(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\) are arbitrary integers.\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$$\n\n$$x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$$\n\n$$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$$\n\n**Step 5**: We can check that 4, 5, and 7 are pairwise co-prime. So, we can apply CRT to find the solution. The solution is:\n\n$$x \\equiv (1 \\times 35 + 2 \\times 28 + 3 \\times 20) \\pmod{4 \\times 5 \\times 7}$$\n\n$$x \\equiv 171 \\pmod{140}$$\n\n**Step 6**: Since \\(x\\) is positive and less than 200, the smallest positive integer that satisfies this congruence is:\n\n$$x = 171 \\pmod{140}$$\n\n$$x = 31$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$31$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we look for an integer which leaves remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.  Checking the remainders of 2, 7, 12, 17, $\\ldots$ when divided by 4, we find that 17 is the least positive integer satisfying this condition.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the only positive integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 are those that differ from 17 by a multiple of $4\\cdot 5=20$.  Checking the remainders of 17, 37, $\\ldots$ when divided by 7, we find that $17$ leaves a remainder of 3.
