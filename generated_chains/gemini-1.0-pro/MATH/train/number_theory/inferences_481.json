At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. The positive even factors of $504$ are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$, and $504$. The sum of these factors is $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 504 = 1012$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1012}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$."
