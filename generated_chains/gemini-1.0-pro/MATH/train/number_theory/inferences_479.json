At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $0.8= \\frac{y}{186+x}$, find the smallest value of $x$, if $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can cross-multiply to get $0.8(186+x) = y$. This simplifies to $y = 148.8+0.8x$. Since $y$ is an integer, $0.8x$ must be an integer. The smallest possible integer for $0.8x$ is $1$, which occurs when $x = 1$. Therefore, $y = 148.8+0.8(1) = 149.6$. Since $y$ must also be an integer, we round down to get $y = 149$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$x = 1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$. As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$. This number is 190, which implies $\\boxed{x=4}$."
