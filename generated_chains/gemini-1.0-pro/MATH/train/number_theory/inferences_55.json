At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation?",
        "inference": "The tens place is the same as the remainder when $7^{2005}$ is divided by $100$.\n\nWe have $7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{100}$.\n\nTherefore, $7^{2005} \\equiv 7^{4\\cdot 501 + 1} \\equiv 7 \\pmod{100}$.\n\nThus, the digit in the tens place is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$."
