At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The factors of $1$ are $1$ and $-1$.  Since $1000a+100b+10c+1$ is positive, we have that $1000a+100b+10c+1=1$.  This gives us that $1000a+100b+10c=0$.  Simplifying, we get $100(10a+10b+c)=0$.  Since $100$ is not zero, we must have that $10a+10b+c=0$.  Simplifying, we get $10(a+b)+c=0$.  Since $10$ is not zero, we must have that $a+b=-c$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, we must have that $a+b+c$ is a digit.  The largest possible digit is $9$, so we have that $a+b+c=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",

Since $0<y\\le9$ and $y$ divides into $1000$, $y$ must equal one of $1,2,4,5$ or $8$. Notice that $y\\neq1$ because then $abc = 1000$, which is impossible as $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. So, breaking down the remaining possibilities: \\begin{align*}\ny&=2 \\Rightarrow abc = 2^2\\cdot5^3 = 500 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 5+0+0=5 \\\\\ny&=4 \\Rightarrow abc = 2\\cdot5^3 = 250 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+5+0=7 \\\\\ny&=5 \\Rightarrow abc = 2^3\\cdot5^2 = 200 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+0+0 = 2 \\\\\ny&=8 \\Rightarrow abc = 5^3 = 125 \\Rightarrow a+b+c =1+2+5 = 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value of $a+b+c$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
