        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16?",
        "inference": "The largest four-digit number is 9999. The digits of this number add up to 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36, which is greater than 16. \n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 does not exist.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{there\\space don't\\spaceexist\\space a\\space largest\\space four-digit\\space number\\space whose\\space digits\\space add\\space up\\space to\\space 16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$."
