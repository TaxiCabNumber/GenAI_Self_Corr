At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
        "inference": "The number of rows must be a factor of 288, greater than or equal to 10, and the number of students in each row must be a factor of 288, greater than or equal to 15.\n\nThe factors of 288 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 86, 144, and 288.\n\nThe factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 10 are 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 86, 144, and 288.\n\nThe factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 15 are 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 86, 144, and 288.\n\nThe common factors of 288 that are greater than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 15 are 24, 36, 48, 72, 86, 144, and 288.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $x$ are 24, 36, 48, 72, 86, 144, and 288.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $x$ is $24 + 36 + 48 + 72 + 86 + 144 + 288 = 698$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{698}.$ I hope it is correct.",
