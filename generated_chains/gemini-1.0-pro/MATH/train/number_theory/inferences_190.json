        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
        "inference": "Let's solve the problem step by step:\nIf $3$ students sit in the last row when sitting in rows of $7$, then the number of students in the class must be a multiple of $7$ plus $3$. Similarly, if $1$ student sits in the last row when sitting in rows of $5$, then the number of students must be a multiple of $5$ plus $1$. So, the number of students in the class must be a common multiple of $7$ and $5$. The least common multiple of $7$ and $5$ is $35$, so the number of students is  $35 + 1 = 36$ . \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class."
