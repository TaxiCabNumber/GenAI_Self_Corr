        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo circles, one of radius 5 inches, the other of radius 2 inches, are tangent at point P. Two bugs start crawling at the same time from point P, one crawling along the larger circle at $3\\pi$ inches per minute, the other crawling along the smaller circle at $2.5\\pi$ inches per minute. How many minutes is it before their next meeting at point P?",
        "inference": "The larger circle is $2\\pi \\cdot 5 = 10\\pi$ inches around.\nSince the bugs are each going at an integer multiple of $\\pi$, they will always meet on both circles when they have each traveled an integer number of times around their respective circles.\nThe lcm of 2 and 5 is 10, so that is the lcm of $2\\pi$ and $5\\pi$ as well.  So the big bug goes around 5 times while the smaller bug goes around 2 times, when they meet again at P.\nThus, the smaller bug goes around 2 times in $2 \\cdot 10 / 2.5 \\pi = 4/\\pi $ minutes; so the next meeting is 4 / minutes after the start.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4/\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The circumference of the larger circle, $C_1$, is $2\\cdot5\\pi=10\\pi$. The circumference of the smaller circle, $C_2$, is $2\\cdot2\\pi=4\\pi$. The bug on $C_1$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{10\\pi}{3\\pi}=\\frac{10}{3}$ minutes, while the bug on $C_2$ crawls the circumference in $\\frac{4\\pi}{2.5\\pi}=\\frac{8}{5}$ minutes. The two bugs will meet at point P in some $t$ minutes, when $t\\div\\frac{10}{3}=\\frac{3t}{10}$ and $t\\div\\frac{8}{5}=\\frac{5t}{8}$ are both integers. We have $\\text{GCD}(3,10)=\\text{GCD}(5,8)=1$, so we have to find the LCM of $10=2\\cdot5$ and $8=2^3$. The LCM is $2^3\\cdot5=40$, so the bugs will next meet in $t=\\boxed{40}$ minutes."
