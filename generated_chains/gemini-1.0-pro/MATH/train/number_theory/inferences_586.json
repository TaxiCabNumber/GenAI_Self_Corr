        "inference": "The hyperbola is $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$. Solving this equation for $y$, we get $y = \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 2000^2}$. We want to find the number of lattice points on this hyperbola, which means we want to find the number of pairs of integers $(x, y)$ such that $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$.\n\nSince $x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$, we know that $x+y$ and $x-y$ must both be factors of $2000^2$. The factors of $2000^2$ are $2^8 \\cdot 5^4$, so the possible values of $x+y$ and $x-y$ are:\n\n* $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$ and $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$\n* $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$ and $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n* $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$ and $2^2 \\cdot 5^4$\n* $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$ and $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n* $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$ and $2^2 \\cdot 5^4$\n* $2^2 \\cdot 5^4$ and $2^2 \\cdot 5^4$\n\nFor each of these pairs of factors, we can solve for $x$ and $y$. For example, if $x+y = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$ and $x-y = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$, then we have:\n\n```\nx = (2^4 \\cdot 5^2 + 2^4 \\cdot 5^2) / 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2\ny = (2^4 \\cdot 5^2 - 2^4 \\cdot 5^2) / 2 = 0\n```\n\nSo the lattice point $(2^4 \\cdot 5^2, 0)$ lies on the hyperbola.\n\nWe can do the same thing for each of the other pairs of factors. We find that the lattice points that lie on the hyperbola are:\n\n* $(2^4 \\cdot 5^2, 0)$\n* $(2^4 \\cdot 5^2, \\pm 2^3 \\cdot 5^3)$\n* $(2^4 \\cdot 5^2, \\pm 2^2 \\cdot 5^4)$\n* $(2^3 \\cdot 5^3, \\pm 2^4 \\cdot 5^2)$\n* $(2^3 \\cdot 5^3, \\pm 2^3 \\cdot 5^3)$\n* $(2^3 \\cdot 5^3, \\pm 2^2 \\cdot 5^4)$\n* $(2^2 \\cdot 5^4, 0)$\n* $(2^2 \\cdot 5^4, \\pm 2^4 \\cdot 5^2)$\n* $(2^2 \\cdot 5^4, \\pm 2^3 \\cdot 5^3)$\n\nSo there are a total of $9$ lattice points that lie on the hyperbola.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$9$}.
