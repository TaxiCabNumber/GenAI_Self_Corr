        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many natural-number factors does $\\textit{N}$ have if $\\textit{N} = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe number of factors is the product of the number of factors for each prime factor. For $2^3$, there are $3+1=4$ factors. For $3^2$, there are $2+1=3$ factors. For $5^1$, there are $1+1=2$ factors. Therefore, the total number of factors is $4\\times3\\times2=24$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$24$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$ and $0 \\le c \\le 1$. In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$."
