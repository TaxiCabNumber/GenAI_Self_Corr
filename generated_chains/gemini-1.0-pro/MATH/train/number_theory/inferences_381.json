At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the two-digit integer $MM$, with equal digits, is multiplied by the one-digit integer $M$, the result is the three-digit integer $NPM$. What is the greatest possible value of $NPM$?",
