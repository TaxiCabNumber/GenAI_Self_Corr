At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
        "inference": "Let x and x + 1 be the two consecutive positive integers, and x - 1, x, and x + 1 be the three consecutive integers.\n\nThen, we have:\nx(x + 1) = 210\n(x - 1)x(x + 1) = 210\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\nx - 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, x = 4.\n\nThe five integers are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Their sum is:\n3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$."
