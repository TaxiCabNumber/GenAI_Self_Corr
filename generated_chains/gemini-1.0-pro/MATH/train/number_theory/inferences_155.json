        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminate?",
        "inference": "Since $\\frac{2}{5}=0.4$ terminates, $\\frac{4}{5}=0.8$ terminates, and $\\frac{6}{5}=1.2$ terminates, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ will terminate if and only if $n$ is divisible by 5.  Since $475=5^2\\cdot 19$, $\\frac{n}{475}$ will terminate if and only if the prime factorization of $n$ does not contain a factor of 19.  The only integer between 1 and 474 inclusive that contains a factor of 19 is $19$ itself.  So the number of integers between 1 and 474 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates is $474-1=\\boxed{473}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{473}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal."
