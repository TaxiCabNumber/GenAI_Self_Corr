At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat day of the week will it be 40 days from Tuesday?",

Dividing by 7 (the number of days in a week) gives a remainder of 2.\n\n4. The remainder of 2 corresponds to **Thursday**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{Thursday}. I hope it is correct.**",
