        "inference": "**Solution:**\n**Step 1**:  First, note that $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$. Thus, $5^n\\equiv 5^2\\cdot 5^{n-2}\\equiv 1\\cdot 5^{n-2}\\equiv 5^{n-2}\\pmod 3$ for all integers $n\\geq 2$.\n\n**Step 2**:  Now, consider the powers of $n$ modulo $3$:\n* $n^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$\n* $n^3\\equiv n\\pmod 3$\n* $n^4\\equiv n^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$\n* $n^5\\equiv n^3\\equiv n\\pmod 3$\n\n**Step 3**:  Combining Steps 1 and 2, we have $5^n\\equiv n^5\\pmod 3$ if and only if $5^{n-2}\\equiv n\\pmod 3$.\n\n**Step 4**:  The smallest positive integer $m$ such that $5^m\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ is $m=2$. Therefore, we want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $5^{2k}\\equiv k\\pmod 3$.\n\n**Step 5**:  Note that $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$. Therefore, $5^{2k}\\equiv 1^k\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ for all integers $k$. Thus, $5^{2k}\\equiv k\\pmod 3$ if and only if $k\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{n=5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First notice that $5^n\\equiv 2^n\\pmod 3$, which should make our computations easier. For $n=1,2,3,4$, we get $2^n\\equiv 2,1,2,1\\pmod 3$ respectively and $n^5\\equiv 1,2,0,1\\pmod 3$ respectively. Since we have a congruent pair at $n=\\boxed{4}$, we don't need to look any further."
