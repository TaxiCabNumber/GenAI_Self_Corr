At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "We have $23_b = b^2 + 3b$. Thus, $b^2 + 3b - 23 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(b - 4)(b + 5) = 0$. Since $b > 3$, we must have $b = 5$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer."
