At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what base is the representation of $285_{10}$ a four digit number whose final digit is odd?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Convert $285_{10}$ to base 2.\n$285_{10} = 100011101_2$\n\n**Step 2**: The final digit is odd, so the base must be odd.\n\n**Step 3**: Try different odd bases and see which one gives a four-digit number.\n\n**For base 3**:\n$285_{10} = 3301_3$ (four digits)\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit."
