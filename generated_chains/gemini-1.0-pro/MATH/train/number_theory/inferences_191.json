At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the first digit (from left to right) of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$?",

This can be done by repeated division by $8$.\n\n$$473\\div8=59\\text{ remainder }1$$\n\n$$59\\div8=7\\text{ remainder }3$$\n\n$$7\\div8=0\\text{ remainder }7$$\n\nSo, $473_{10}=731_8$.\n\nThe first digit of $731_8$ is $7$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7}.
