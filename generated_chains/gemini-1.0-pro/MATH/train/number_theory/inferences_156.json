At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where the first and second terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8?",
