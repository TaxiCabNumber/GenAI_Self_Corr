At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7.",

The multiples of 7 less than 74 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70.\nNow, we need to find the largest multiple of 7 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. The largest multiple of 7 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is 70.\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is $\\boxed{70}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{70}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$).  $74 \\div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \\times 7 + 4$.  We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\\boxed{73}$ is the answer."
