        "ground_truth": "We start working from the rightmost column. Since $5>2$, $A_6+B_6+5_6$ is either equal to $12_6$ or $22_6$.

This means that $B_6=1$, which makes $A_6=12_6$. Since $A$ has to be a single-digit integer, this is impossible. Therefore, we try $A_6+B_6=3_6$. This gives us $1_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$, which means $B_6=2$, and $A_6=1_6$. We plug $B=2$ and $A=1$ into the equation to see if it works.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & &_{1}&\\\\ & & & 2& 2 & 1_6\\\\ & & & 4 & 1 & 2_6\\\\& & + & 1 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 1 & 1 & 5& 2_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$Therefore, the difference is $2_6 - 1_6 = \\boxed{1_6}$."
