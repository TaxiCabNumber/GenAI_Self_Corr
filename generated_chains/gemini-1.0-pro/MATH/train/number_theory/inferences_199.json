The digit in each quotient repeats periodically in the same order. Therefore, the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the same as the 8th digit, which is \\(4\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",

When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$.
