        "inference": "**Solution 1:**\n\nExpress the number in base 7:\n\n$$403_{10} = 1132_7$$\n\nThe number of even digits is therefore $\\boxed{2}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by converting $403_{10}$ into base-7. Since $7^3=343$ is the largest power of 7 that is less than 403, and it can go into the given number once, the coefficient of the $7^3$ term will be 1. From here, we are left with a remainder of $403-343=60$. The largest power of 7 less than this number is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 that is less than 60 is $1\\cdot49=49$ itself. This leaves us with $60-49=11$, which we can express as $1\\cdot7^1+4\\cdot7^0$. So, we find that $403_{10}=1\\cdot7^3+1\\cdot7^2+1\\cdot{7^1}+4\\cdot7^0=1114_7$, which only has $\\boxed{1}$ even digit."

        "inference": "**Solution 2:**\n\nSince the number is expressed in base 7, the digits are in the set \\\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\\\}. The only even digits in this set are 0, 2, 4, and 6.
