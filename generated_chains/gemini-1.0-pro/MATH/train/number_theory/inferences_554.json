        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated. The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$. If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$. Play the role of the magician and determine $(abc)$ if $N= 3194$.\n",
        "inference": "The original number $(abc)$ can be recovered from $N$ as follows:\n$$N = (abc) + (acb) + (bca) + (bac) + (cab) + (cba)$$\n$$= 111a + 111b + 111c + 111a + 111c + 111b =222(a+b+c)$$\nThus, $$N/222 = a+b+c$$\nSince $14<\\frac{3194}{222}<15$, $a+b+c =14$. Therefore, $a=9$ or $10$, since $a$ must be greater than $2$ for the number to be three digits. If $a=9$, then $a+b+c =9+b+c = 14$ implies that $b+c=5$. But $b+c$ cannot exceed $18$ , which it  would if $b=9$ and $c=9$. Thus, $a\\neq 9$. It follows that $a=10$, so that $a+b+c = 10+b+c = 14$, which implies that $b+c =4$. Since $b$ and $c$ are digits, the only possibility is $b=2$ and $c=2$. Therefore, the original number is $(abc)=\\boxed{1022}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1022}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality."
