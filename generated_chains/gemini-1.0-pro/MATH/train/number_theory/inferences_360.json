At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of $159137$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**:\nThe prime factors of 159137 are $19, 41, and 383$. \nTherefore, the two largest prime factors are 383 and 41. \nThe positive difference between them is $383 - 41 = \\boxed{342}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{342}$. I hope it is correct.**",
