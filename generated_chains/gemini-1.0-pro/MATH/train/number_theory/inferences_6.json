At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBoth $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b > 1$. When $a^b$ is the greatest possible value less than 399, what is the sum of $a$ and $b$?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of 399 is $3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 19$. So, $a^b < 399$ is equivalent to $a^b < 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 19$. The greatest possible value of $a^b$ less than 399 is $2^6 = 64$, so we have $a^b = 64$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b > 1$, we have $a = 2$ and $b = 6$. Therefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $2 + 6 = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$."
