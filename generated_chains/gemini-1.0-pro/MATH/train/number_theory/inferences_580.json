        "inference": "The integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers if and only if they are of the form $n^2-m^2$. We can find all such integers by finding all pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is between 1 and 1000.\n\nWe can start by finding all pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is less than 1000. We can do this by trial and error. We can start with $n=1$ and $m=0$, and then increase $n$ by 1 until we find a pair of integers that satisfies the condition. We can then continue increasing $n$ by 1 until we find all pairs of integers that satisfy the condition.\n\nWe can then find all pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is greater than or equal to 1. We can do this by trial and error. We can start with $n=1$ and $m=0$, and then increase $n$ by 1 until we find a pair of integers that satisfies the condition. We can then continue increasing $n$ by 1 until we find all pairs of integers that satisfy the condition.\n\nWe can then combine the two lists of pairs of integers to get a list of all pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is between 1 and 1000. We can then count the number of pairs in the list to get the number of integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers.\n\nThe number of pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is less than 1000 is 49. The number of pairs of nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n^2-m^2$ is greater than or equal to 1 is 49. Therefore, the number of integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers is $49+49=\\boxed{98}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{98}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer. All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$"
