        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
        "inference": "Ami skips 3 girls and throws to the 5th girl, so the next throw will be to the 9th girl. This means that the ball will skip 4 girls (3 to get to the 5th girl and 1 more to get to the 9th girl). The ball will continue to skip 4 girls for each throw.\n\nSince there are 11 girls, the ball will complete 2 full circles (11 girls \u00d7 2 = 22 girls) before it returns to Ami. In addition, the ball will need to skip 4 more girls to return to Ami (22 + 4 = 26).\n\nTherefore, the total number of throws necessary for the ball to return to Ami is 26.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{26}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami."
