At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPalindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665. What is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3?",
        "inference": "The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3 is the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6. The smallest four-digit palindrome is 1001. 1001 is not divisible by 6, so the next smallest four-digit palindrome is 1111. 1111 is divisible by 6, so it is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1111}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible."
