I hope it is correct.'\nNatasha has more than $\\$1$ but less than $\\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
        "inference": "- We know the number of dimes, $d$, is more than 1 and less than 10, i.e., $1 < d < 10$.\n- When Natasha puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over, which means $d = 3k+1$ for some integer $k$.\n- Similarly, when she puts them in stacks of 4, she has $d = 4l+1$ for some integer $l$.\n- When she puts them in stacks of 5, she has $d = 5m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n\n- Equating $3k+1$ and $4l+1$, we get $3k = 4l$, which gives $k = 4l/3$. Since $k$ is an integer, $l$ must be a multiple of 3.\n- Similarly, equating $4l+1$ and $5m+1$, we get $4l = 5m$, which gives $l = 5m/4$. Since $l$ is a multiple of 3, $m$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n- The smallest positive integer $m$ that satisfies these conditions is $m = 3$, which gives $l = 5m/4 = 15/4$, and $k = 4l/3 = 20/3$.\n- Therefore, the smallest possible value of $d$ is $d = 3k+1 = 3(20/3)+1 = 21$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system."
