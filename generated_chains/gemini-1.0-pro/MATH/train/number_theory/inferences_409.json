At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of the number must be of the form $p^7$ for some prime number $p$. Thus, the number is $p^7$. The smallest prime number is $2$. Thus, the smallest number $p^7$ is $2^7 = 128$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{128}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$."
