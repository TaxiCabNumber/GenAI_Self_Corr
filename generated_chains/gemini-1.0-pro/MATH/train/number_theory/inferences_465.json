        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$, where $A$ and $B$ are valid digits in their respective bases?",
        "inference": "$A$ in base-5 can take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  $AA_5$ can therefore take the values $00_5, 11_5, 22_5, 33_5,$ or $44_5$.  Converting each of these to base-10 gives $0, 5, 12, 21,$ or $32$.\n\n$B$ in base-7 can take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  $BB_7$ can therefore take the values $00_7, 11_7, 22_7, 33_7, 44_7, 55_7,$ or $66_7$.  Coverting each of these to base-10 gives $0, 8, 19, 34, 53, 76,$ or $103$.\n\nThe smallest base-10 integer that is in both of these lists is $34$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$."
