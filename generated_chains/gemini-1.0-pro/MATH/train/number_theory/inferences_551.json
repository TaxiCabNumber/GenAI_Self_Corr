        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe integer $n$ is the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$. Compute $\\frac{n}{15}$.\n",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\nSince every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$, $n$ is of the form $80000\\cdots80000$. The number of digits of $n$ must be a multiple of $3$ since $15$ is divisible by $3$. The largest number of digits of such a number is $3$, so $n$ has $3$ digits. Therefore, $n = 888$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{n}{15} = \\frac{888}{15} = 59.2$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{59.2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$."
