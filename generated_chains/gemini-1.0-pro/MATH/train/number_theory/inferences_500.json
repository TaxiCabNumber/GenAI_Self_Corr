        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits?",
        "inference": "In base $b$, the largest two-digit number is $b^2-1$. Since $62 > b^2-1$, three digits are needed to express it in base $b$. Therefore, $b^3 \\ge 62$. The smallest $b$ satisfying this inequality is $b = 4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$."
