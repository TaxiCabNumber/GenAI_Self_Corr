At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCall an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
        "inference": "Since $b>1$, the prime factorization of $n$ must include at least one prime number raised to an odd power. Thus, the prime factorization of $n$ must include a factor raised to the first power. \nNow let us consider the prime decomposition of 2010.\n\n$$2010 = 2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot67$$\n\nWe observe that the only factor of 2010 that can be raised to an odd power to give a number less than 2010 is 3. So, the only prime we need to consider is 3. Thus, an odd integer $n<2010$ is oddly powerful if and only if $n=3^e$ for some positive integer $e$. \nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ oddly powerful integers less than 2010.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$."
