At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ has a common difference of $6$. A second sequence begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$. In the range of $1$ to $100$, what is the largest number common to both sequences?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nBoth sequences are arithmetic sequences, so they can be written in the form $a_n=a_1+(n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference. For the first sequence, we have $a_1=1$ and $d=6$, so the $n$th term is $a_n=1+(n-1)6=6n-5$. For the second sequence, we have $a_1=4$ and $d=7$, so the $n$th term is $a_n=4+(n-1)7=7n-3$.\n\nTo find the largest number common to both sequences in the range of $1$ to $100$, we need to find the largest value of $n$ for which both $a_n$ and $b_n$ are integers between $1$ and $100$.\n\nWe can set the two expressions for $a_n$ and $b_n$ equal to each other and solve for $n$:\n\n```\n6n-5=7n-3\n7n-6n=5-3\nn=2\n```\n\nTherefore, the largest number common to both sequences in the range of $1$ to $100$ is the $2$nd term of both sequences, which is $a_2=6(2)-5=7$ and $b_2=7(2)-3=11$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences."
