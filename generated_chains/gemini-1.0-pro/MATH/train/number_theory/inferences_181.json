Let's say the common prime factors are **2, 3,** and **5**.\n\n**Step 3: Factorization with Common Prime Factors**\n\nNow, we can factorize both numbers with the common prime factors:\n\n* 90 = 2 * 3^2 * 5\n* m = 2 * 3^2 * 5 * x\n\nwhere **x** is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 4: Greatest Common Divisor**\n\nThe greatest of the three common divisors of 90 and m is the product of all their common prime factors to the highest power. Therefore:\n\n* Greatest Common Divisor = 2 * 3^2 * 5 = 180\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$180$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$."
