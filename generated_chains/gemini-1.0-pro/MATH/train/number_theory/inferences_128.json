At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo distinct positive integers $x$ and $y$ are factors of 36. If $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36, what is the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$?",
        "inference": "Since $x$ and $y$ are distinct positive integers and $36=2^2\\cdot 3^2$, either $x$ or $y$ must be odd. Let $y$ be odd. Then $x$ must be even. The smallest even factor of 36 is 2, and the smallest odd factor is 3. If $x=2$ and $y=3$, then $x \\cdot y=6$ is a factor of 36, so this is not the smallest possible value of $x \\cdot y$. Therefore, $x=4$ and $y=9$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$36$}. I hope it is correct.",

We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product."
