        "inference": "To find the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer, we can first simplify the expression:\n\n$$\\frac{n+6}{n} = 1 + \\frac{6}{n}$$\n\nSince the expression is an integer, $\\frac{6}{n}$ must be an integer. The positive integral divisors of $6$ are $1, 2, 3, and 6$. Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are:\n\n$$n = 1, 2, 3, 6$$\n\nThe sum of these values is:\n\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = \\boxed{12}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$."
