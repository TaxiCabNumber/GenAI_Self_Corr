At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe have that $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$ is equivalent to $6x+1\\equiv \\frac{4}{3}\\pmod p$, which has no solution if and only if $\\frac{4}{3}\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod p$. Since $3$ is a primitive root of $p$, this is equivalent to $\\frac{4}{3}\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, or $4\\not\\equiv 3\\pmod p$. The only prime for which this is the case is $p=13$, so the sum of all such primes is $\\boxed{13}$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$."
