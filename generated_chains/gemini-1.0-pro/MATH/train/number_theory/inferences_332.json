At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
        "inference": "The proper factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, and $1+2+3+4+6=16>12$, so 12 is abundant.\nThe proper factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, and $1+2+3+6+9=21>18$, so 18 is abundant.\nThe factors of 20 are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10$, and 20 itself, so $1+2+4+5+10=22<20$, so 20 is not abundant.\nThe factors of 21 are $1, 3, 7$, and 21 itself, so $1+3+7=11<21$, so 21 is not abundant.\nThe factors of 22 are $1, 2, 11$, and 22 itself, so $1+2+11=14<22$, so 22 is not abundant.\nThe factors of 23 are $1$, and 23 itself, so $1<23$, so 23 is not abundant.\nThe factors of 24 are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$, and 24 itself, so $1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$, so 24 is abundant.\nSo there are $\\boxed{3}$ abundant numbers less than 25.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1.
