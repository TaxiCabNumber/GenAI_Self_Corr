        "inference": "The sum of the numbers in each row, in each column, and along the two main diagonals must be equal.

        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$."
