At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGeorge is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of cents in the change.  If George receives the maximum number of quarters possible, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to x/25, then the remaining cents are given by x - 25(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/25]).  Since he requires 3 pennies, the remaining amount should be a multiple of 3.  Thus, x - 25(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/25]) = 3k for some integer k.  Similarly, if George receives the maximum number of dimes possible, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to x/10, then the remaining cents are given by x - 10(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/10]).  Since he requires 8 pennies, the remaining amount should be a multiple of 3.  Thus, x - 10(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/10]) = 8l for some integer l.  We need to find the sum of all possible values of x that satisfy these two conditions.  We can start by finding the possible values of x for each condition separately.  For the first condition, we need to find the smallest value of x such that x - 25(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/25]) = 3k for some integer k.  We can start with k = 1 and check if there is a value of x that satisfies the equation.  If there is not, we increment k and try again.  We can continue this process until we find the smallest value of x that satisfies the equation.  For the second condition, we can follow the same procedure to find the smallest value of x such that x - 10(Greatest IntegerFunction[x/10]) = 8l for some integer l.  Once we have found the smallest values of x that satisfy each condition, we can find the range of possible values of x by subtracting the first value from the second value.  The sum of all possible values of x is then equal to the sum of the smallest values of x plus the range multiplied by the average of the smallest values of x.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{123}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents."
