        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
        "inference": "Let the number of members of the band be x.\n\nWhen they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied, so $x = 8r + 2$, where r is the number of columns.\n\nWhen they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied, so $x = 9s + 3$, where s is the number of columns.\n\nSince the membership is between 100 and 200, we have $100 \\le x \\le 200$.\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get $8r + 2 = 9s + 3$.\n\nTherefore, $9s - 8r = -1$.\n\nSince $r$ and $s$ are positive integers, the only solution is $r = 9$ and $s = 8$.\n\nTherefore, $x = 8 \\cdot 9 + 2 = \\boxed{74}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{74}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members."
