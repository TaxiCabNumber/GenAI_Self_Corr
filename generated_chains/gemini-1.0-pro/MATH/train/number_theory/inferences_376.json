At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 2.\n369,963 is odd, so the remainder is 1.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 3.\nThe sum of the digits of 369,963 is 27, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, the remainder is 0.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6.\nSince the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 2 is 1 and the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 3 is 0, the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 4.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$."
