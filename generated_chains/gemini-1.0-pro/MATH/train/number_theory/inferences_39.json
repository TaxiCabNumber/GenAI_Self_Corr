At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
        "inference": "Since the number is divisible by 18, it must be divisible by both 2 and 9. The number is divisible by 2 if and only if n is even, and the number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits is $7+1+2+n=10+n$. For this to be divisible by 9, n must be 8.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$."
