        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct digits can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number?",
        "inference": "Let's consider the possible remainders when a perfect square is divided by 10. If a number is a perfect square, then its remainder when divided by 4 is either 0 or 1. Since the units digit determines the remainder when divided by 4, we need to consider the remainders of perfect squares when divided by 8.\n\nIf a number is a perfect square, then its remainder when divided by 8 is either 0, 1, or 4. This is because a perfect square can be expressed as the sum of two consecutive odd numbers, and the remainder of the sum of two consecutive odd numbers when divided by 8 is either 0, 1, or 4.\n\nTherefore, the possible remainders when an integral perfect square is divided by 10 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. Since the units digit of a number determines the remainder when divided by 10, the possible units digits of an integral perfect-square number are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$."
