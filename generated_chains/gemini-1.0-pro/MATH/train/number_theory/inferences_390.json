At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 100th letter in the pattern ABCABCABC...?",

The remainder tells us which letter in the pattern the 100th letter is. Since the remainder is 1, the 100th letter is the first letter in the pattern, which is A.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$A$}.
