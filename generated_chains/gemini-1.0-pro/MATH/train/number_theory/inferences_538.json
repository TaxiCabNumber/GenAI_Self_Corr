        "inference": "Let the three-digit palindromes be 101 * x and 101 * y, where x and y are two-digit numbers.\n\nThen, we have:\n\n(101 * x) * (101 * y) = 436,995\n\n10101 * x * y = 436,995\n\nx * y = 436,995 / 10101\n\nx * y = 43\n\nThe factors of 43 are 1 and 43, 7 and 6, and 43 and 1.\n\nSince x and y are two-digit numbers, the only possible factors are 6 and 7.\n\nTherefore, x = 6 and y = 7, or x = 7 and y = 6.\n\nThe two three-digit palindromes are 101 * 6 = 606 and 101 * 7 = 707, or 101 * 7 = 707 and 101 * 6 = 606.\n\nTheir sum is 606 + 707 = 1313.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1313}.

We see that $3^2\\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot13=585$. Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\\boxed{1332}$."
