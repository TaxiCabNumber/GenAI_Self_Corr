At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive integers $A,$ $B,$ $A-B,$ and $A+B$ are all prime numbers.

Thus, the sum of the four primes is\n$$A+(A-B)+(A+B)+B=3A\\equiv0\\pmod{3}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{B}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime."
