At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday. School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of Mondays in each month from September to December.\n\n- September: 1 (4, 11, 18, 25)\n- October: 2 (2, 9, 16, 23, 30)\n- November: 1 (6, 13, 20, 27)\n- December: 1 (4, 11, 18, 25)\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the month in which the fifth Monday occurs.\n\n- Total Mondays from September to November: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n- Since we need 5 Mondays, the fifth Monday must occur in December.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the date of the first Monday in December.\n\n- The first Monday in December is Monday, December 4.\n\n**Step 4:** Count forward 4 Mondays from December 4 to determine the date of the Marvelous Monday.\n\n- December 4, 11, 18, 25: 4 Mondays\n- Therefore, the Marvelous Monday falls on **Monday, December 25**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{Monday, December 25}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$."
