At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$?",
        "inference": "Since $2^{10}$ is divisible by the perfect squares $2^2, 2^4, 2^6, 2^8, 2^{10}$, and the perfect square $3^2$ divides $3^{12}$ and the perfect square $5^2$ divides $5^{15}$, the only other perfect squares that could possibly divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$ are $3^2$ and $5^2$. Thus, the number of positive perfect square integers that divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$ is $5+2=\\boxed{7}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number.
