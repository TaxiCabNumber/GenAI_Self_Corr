At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. First, count the number of perfect squares and perfect cubes between 1 and 150.\n    - Perfect squares: $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ... , 12^2 = 144$. There are $\\sqrt{144} = 12$ perfect squares.\n    - Perfect cubes: $1^3, 2^3, 3^3, ... , 5^3 = 125$. There are $\\sqrt[3]{125} = 5$ perfect cubes.\n\n\n2. The numbers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes are: $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125$. There are $12+5-1 = 16$ such numbers.\n\n\n3. Therefore, the number of numbers from 1 to 150 that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes is $150-16 = \\boxed{134}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$134$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube."
