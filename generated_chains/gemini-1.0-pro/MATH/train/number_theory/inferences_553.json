At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Since $c - a = 19$, it follows that $c = 19 + a$. Then, since $c^3 = d^2$, we have \n$$(19 + a)^3 = d^2.$$\nAlso, since $a^5 = b^4$, we have $a = b^{4/5}$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get\n$$(19 + b^{4/5})^3 = d^2.$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n$$19 + b^{4/5} = d.$$\nTherefore, $d - b = d - b^{4/5} = 19\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{b^{1/5}}\\right)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{b^{1/5}}\\right)}$.

        "ground_truth": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$."
