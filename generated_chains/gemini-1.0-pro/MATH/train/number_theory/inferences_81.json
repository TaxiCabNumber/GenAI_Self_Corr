We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the remainder:\n\n```\n-811 = 24 * (-33) + 11\n```\n\nSo, the remainder when $-811$ is divided by $24$ is $11$. Therefore, the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$ is $\\boxed{11}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24)."
