At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFor any positive integer $n$, $n+1$ is the number of positive factors of $n$.\n\nThe greatest possible value of $n$ is 15, so the greatest possible number of positive factors of $n$ is $15+1 = 16$.\n\nThe greatest possible value of $b$ is 15, so the greatest possible number of prime factors of $b$ is 5 (since the prime factorization of 15 is $3 \\times 5$).\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of positive factors of $b^n$ is $16 \\times 5 = \\boxed{80}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$80$}.

        "ground_truth": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors."
