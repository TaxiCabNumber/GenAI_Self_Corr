At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes?",

        "ground_truth": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes."
