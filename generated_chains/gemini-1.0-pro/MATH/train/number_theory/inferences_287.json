At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the common factors of 840 and 1008.\n\n840 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7\n1008 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7\n\nThe common factors are 2^3 * 3 * 7.\n\n**Step 2**: Multiply the common factors to find the largest number of stamps that can be put on each page.\n\n2^3 * 3 * 7 = 168\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{168}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$."
