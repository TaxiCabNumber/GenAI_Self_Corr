        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the first three prime numbers be x. \nThen, x = (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5)/3 = (15 + 10 + 6)/30 = 31/30.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$31/30$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The first three prime numbers are $2$, $3$, and $5$, and their reciprocals are $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$ respectively. To find the mean of these three numbers, we must first find their sum and then divide that sum by $3$. To find the sum of $1/2$, $1/3$, and $1/5$, we first place each fraction over their least common denominator of $30$. Thus, we have that $$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{15}{30} + \\frac{10}{30} + \\frac{6}{30} = \\frac{31}{30}.$$\n\nDividing $\\frac{31}{30}$ by $3$, we get that the mean of these three numbers is $\\frac{31}{30 \\cdot 3} = \\boxed{\\frac{31}{90}}$."
