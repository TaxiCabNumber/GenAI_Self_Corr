At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio $3: 2: 1,$what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?\n",

        "ground_truth": "Denote the number of bananas the first monkey took from the pile as $b_1$, the second $b_2$, and the third $b_3$; the total is $b_1 + b_2 + b_3$.

Also note some other conditions we have picked up in the course of the problem, namely that $b_1$ is divisible by $8$, $b_2$ is divisible by $8$, and $b_3$ is divisible by $72$ (however, since the denominator contains a $27$, the factors of $3$ cancel, and it only really needs to be divisible by $8$). Thus, the minimal value is when each fraction is equal to $8$, and the solution is $8(11 + 13 + 27) = \\boxed{408}$."
