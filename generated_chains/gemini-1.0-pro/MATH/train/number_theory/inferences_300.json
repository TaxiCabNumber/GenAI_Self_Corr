At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 236! ends in how many zeros when expressed as an integer?",
        "inference": "The number of zeros at the end of 236! is equal to the number of factors of 10 in 236!.\n\nEach factor of 10 is either a factor of 2 or a factor of 5.\n\nThere are 58 factors of 2 in 236!.\n\nThere are 23 factors of 5 in 236!.\n\nTherefore, there are 23 + 58 = 81 factors of 10 in 236!.\n\nHence, the number 236! ends in 81 zeros when expressed as an integer.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$81$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros."
