Euler's theorem states that for any integer $a$ and any positive integer $n$ that are relatively prime, $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$.\n\nIn this case, $a = 2$ and $n = 7$.
