At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor $1 \\le n \\le 100$, how many integers are there such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal?",
        "inference": "A decimal is repeating if and only if its denominator has a prime factor of \\(2\\) or \\(5\\), possibly both. Therefore, the only denominators that give repeating decimals are \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(5\\), \\(10\\), \\(20\\), \\(25\\), \\(50\\), and \\(100\\). There are \\(8\\) denominators.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$8$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals."
