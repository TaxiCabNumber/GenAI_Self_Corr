At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn integer $n$ is said to be square-free if the only perfect square that divides $n$ is $1^2$. How many positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than $100$ are square-free?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* Since $n$ is odd and greater than $1$, $n$ can be written as $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n* If $n$ is square-free, then $2k + 1$ must not be divisible by any perfect square other than $1^2$.\n* The only perfect squares less than $100$ are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81$.\n* Of these perfect squares, only $4$ and $16$ are divisible by $2$.\n* Therefore, $2k + 1$ must not be divisible by $4$ or $16$.\n\n**Step 1:**\n* Since $4 = 2^2$, $2k + 1$ must be odd.\n* Thus, $k$ must be even.\n\n**Step 2:**\n* Since $16 = 4^2 = 2^4$, $2k + 1$ must not be divisible by $4^2$.\n* This means that $2k$ must not be divisible by $4$.\n* Thus, $k$ must be odd.\n\nHence, there is a contradiction. No odd integer $k$ can satisfy both the conditions. Therefore, there are no positive odd integers greater than $1$ and less than $100$ that are square-free.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{0}$.

        "ground_truth": "If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$."
