At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?",
        "inference": "Every number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 47 will be of the form 47x + 5 for some counting number x.\n\nSince x is a counting number, the smallest value it can have is 1. The largest value of x will be the largest counting number such that 47x + 5 is less than or equal to 47.

        "ground_truth": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47."
