        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
        "inference": "Since $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, it can be expressed as $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSubstituting this into $n+2010$, we get:\n\n$$n+2010 = (6k+1) + 2010 = 6k + 2011$$\n\nDividing $6k+2011$ by 6, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{6k+2011}{6} = k + \\frac{2011}{6}$$\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, $k + \\frac{2011}{6}$ is not. Therefore, the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6 is the same as the remainder when $2011$ is divided by 6.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6 is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6."
