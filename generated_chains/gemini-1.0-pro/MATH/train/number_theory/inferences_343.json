At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive five-digit integer is in the form $AB,CBA$; where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are each distinct digits. What is the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven?",
        "inference": "Since $AB,CBA$ is divisible by 11, the sum of the digits at even places minus the sum of the digits at odd places should be divisible by 11. Here, the sum of the digits at even places is $B+A$ and the sum of the digits at odd places is $C+C=2C$, so we get:\n$$B+A-2C\\equiv0\\pmod{11},$$\nthat is,\n$$B+A\\equiv2C\\pmod{11}.$$\nSince $A+B+C=1+2+\\cdots+9=45$, we can write $B+A\\equiv2C\\equiv2(45-(B+A))\\equiv90-2(B+A)\\pmod{11}.$\nTherefore, we have $90-2(B+A)\\equiv B+A\\pmod{11},$\nwhich implies $3(B+A)\\equiv90\\pmod{11}$.\n\nCase I: If $B+A=2$, then $2(B+A)=4$ and $90-2(B+A)=90-4=86$. Since $3\\times2=6$, we get $6\\equiv86\\pmod{11}$, which is absurd.\n\nCase II: If $B+A=6$, then $2(B+A)=12$ and $90-2(B+A)=90-12=78$. Since $3\\times6=18$, we get $18\\equiv78\\pmod{11}$, which is also absurd.\n\nCase III: If $B+A=10$, then $2(B+A)=20$ and $90-2(B+A)=90-20=70$. Since $3\\times10=30$, we get $30\\equiv70\\pmod{11}$, which is true.\n\nTherefore, $B+A=10$ and $C=45-(B+A)=45-10=35$. Since $A$, $B$ and $C$ are distinct digits, we have $A=1$, $B=9$ and $C=5$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $AB,CBA$ that is divisible by eleven is $19,591$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19,591}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can test an integer for divisibility by $11$ by alternately adding and subtracting its digits.  For example, $8162$ is divisible by 11 because $8-1+6-2=11$ is divisible by 11.  In this case, $2A-2B+C$ must be divisible by 11.  If there are satisfactory values of $B$ and $C$ corresponding to $A=9$, then the resulting integer would be larger than any integer with $A<9$.  Therefore, we try $A=9$ first.  If $A=9$, then $C-2B+18$ must be divisible by $11$.  Equivalently, $C-2B$ equals $-7$ or $4$, which implies $C=2B-7$ or $C=2B+4$.  Wanting to make $B$ as large as possible, we try $B=9,8,7,\\ldots$. $B$ cannot be $9$ because $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be distinct.  If $B=8$, then $C=9$, so again the digits are not distinct.  If $B=7$, then $C=7$ and still the digits are not distinct.  If $B=6$, then $C=5$, and $AB,\\!CBA=\\boxed{96,\\!569}$."
