At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n^2$ is divisible by 18 and $n^3$ is divisible by 640?",
        "inference": "Since $n^3$ is divisible by 640, $n$ must be divisible by 8, because 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides 640. So, $n = 8k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince $n^2$ is divisible by 18, $n^2 = 9mk$ for some integer $m$, because 9 is the highest power of 3 that divides 18.\n\nSubstituting $n = 8k$ into $n^2 = 9mk$, we get $64k^2 = 9mk$. Dividing both sides by 8, we get $8k^2 = mk$. Since $m$ and $k$ are integers, $m$ must be a multiple of 8. The smallest positive multiple of 8 is 8, so $m = 8l$ for some integer $l$.\n\nSubstituting $m = 8l$ into $8k^2 = mk$, we get $8k^2 = 8lk$. Dividing both sides by 8, we get $k^2 = lk$. Since $k$ and $l$ are integers, $k$ must be a multiple of $l$. The smallest positive multiple of $l$ is $l$, so $k = l$.\n\nTherefore, $n = 8k = 8l = 8 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$8$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$."
