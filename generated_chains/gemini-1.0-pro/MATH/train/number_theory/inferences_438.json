At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a number is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. What is the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7?",
        "inference": "When we subtract 7 from three times the number, we get 3x - 7. According to the question, the remainder when the original number is divided by 7 is 2. This means 3x - 7 is divisible by 7. The number 3 is a multiple of 7 (3 x 7 = 21), and when added to -7, the result (-7 + 3 = -4) is also a multiple of 7 ( -4 x 7 = -28). This means that the remainder for the expression 3x - 7 when divided by 7, is the same as the remainder of 3x -7 -(4 x 7) = 3x - 35 divided by 7. Simplifying further, 3x - 35 = x - 5. So, the remainder should be the same as that of x - 5 when divided by 7.\n\nSince x can be any number, and since remainders are non-negative but less than the divisor, the remainder of x - 5 when divided by 7 must be less than 7. It must also be the smallest non-negative integer with that property. This is the value 5.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$"
