At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?",
        "inference": "The least whole number that is divisible by 7 is 7. However, 7 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 through 6. Therefore, the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6 is 7 + 6 = 13.\nFinal Answer: $\\\\boxed{13}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$."
