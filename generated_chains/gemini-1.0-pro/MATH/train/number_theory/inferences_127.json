At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?",
        "inference": "A perfect square factor of 2160 must contain the prime factors of 2160 in even powers. The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. So, a perfect square factor of 2160 must contain $2^2$, $3^2$, and $5^2$. There is only one such factor: $2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 = 900$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160."
