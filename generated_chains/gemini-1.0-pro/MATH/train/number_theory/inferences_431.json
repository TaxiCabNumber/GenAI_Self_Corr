        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA two-digit integer $AB$ equals $\\frac{1}{9}$ of the three-digit integer $AAB$, where $A$ and $B$ represent distinct digits from 1 to 9. What is the smallest possible value of the three-digit integer $AAB$?",
        "inference": "We can write $AB$ as $10A + B$ and $AAB$ as $100A + 10A + B = 110A + B$.  Then we have $10A + B = \\frac{1}{9}(110A + B)$.  Multiplying both sides by 9, we get $90A + 9B = 110A + B$.  Subtracting $90A$ from both sides, we get $9B = 20A$.  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $B = \\frac{20A}{9}$.  Since $A$ and $B$ are distinct digits from 1 to 9, the smallest possible value of $A$ is 2.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $B$ is $\\frac{20 \\times 2}{9} = 4$.  The smallest possible value of $AAB$ is therefore $110A + B = 110 \\times 2 + 4 = 224$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{224}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We rewrite $AB$ as $10A+B$ and $AAB$ as $100A+10A+B$. Now we set $AAB=9\\cdot AB$ since $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$ of $AAB$. \\begin{align*}\n100A+10A+B&=9(10A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=90A+9B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n5A&=2B\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ such that $5A=2B$ are $A=2$ and $B=5$. So $AAB=\\boxed{225}$."
