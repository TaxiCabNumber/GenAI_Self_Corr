        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
        "inference": "Alex needs the number of jellybeans to be a multiple of 13, with a remainder of 11.\nMultiples of 13 are: 13, 26, 39, 52, ...\n\nThe smallest multiple of 13 that leaves a remainder of 11 when divided by 13 is 26.\n\nSo, Alex should buy 26 jellybeans.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans."
