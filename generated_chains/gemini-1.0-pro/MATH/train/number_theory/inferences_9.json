At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n$ is a positive integer, then let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$?",

Thus, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is the sum of the digits of the integer $\\frac{10^n}{5^{{}^n}} = 2^n$, since multiplying by $10^n$ simply shifts all the digits $n$ places to the left. As a result, we start computing powers of 2, looking for an integer which has digits summing to a number greater than 10. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128\n\\end{align*}The sum of the digits in 128 is 11. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is greater than 10 is $n = \\boxed{7}$."
