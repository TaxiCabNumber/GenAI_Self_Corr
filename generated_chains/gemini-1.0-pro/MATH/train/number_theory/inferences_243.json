At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6.

Therefore, the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12 is:\n$$2004 + 8 = 2012$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2012$}. I hope it is correct.",
