At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe least common multiple of two integers is 36 and 6 is their greatest common divisor. What is the product of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: The LCM of two integers, a and b, is given by: LCM (a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).\n\n**Step 2**: We are given that LCM(a, b) = 36 and GCD(a, b) = 6.\n\n**Step 3**: Substituting these values into the formula, we get: 36 = (a * b) / 6.\n\n**Step 4**: Solving for the product of a and b, we get: a * b = 36 * 6.\n\n**Step 5**: a * b = 216.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{216}$.
