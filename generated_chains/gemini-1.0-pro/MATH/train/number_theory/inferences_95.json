At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when (99)(101) is divided by 9?",
        "inference": "99 can be written as 9 * 11 + 0. \n101 can be written as 9 * 11 + 2. \nSo (99)(101) can be written as (9 * 11 + 0)(9 * 11 + 2) = (9 * 11)(9 * 11) + (9 * 11)(2) + (0)(9 * 11) + (0)(2) = 81 * 121 + 189 + 0 + 0 = 9801 + 189 = 10080. \nNow, 10080 divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 1.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Notice that when we divide (99)(101) by 9, we get $\\frac{99\\cdot101}{9}=11\\cdot101$. The quotient is an integer and there is no remainder, so (99)(101) is a multiple of 9 and the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe notice that $99\\cdot101=99\\cdot100+99=9999$. We can easily see that 9999 is divisible by 9, as the division results in 1111 with a remainder of 0. Alternatively, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. In this case, the sum of the digits in 36, a multiple of 9, so 9999 is a also a multiple of 9. That means the remainder when it is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{0}$."
