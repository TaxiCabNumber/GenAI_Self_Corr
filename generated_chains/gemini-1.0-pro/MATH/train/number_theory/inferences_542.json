At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 200th term of the increasing sequence of positive integers formed by omitting only the perfect squares?",
        "inference": "The first term is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, etc. The $n$th term is therefore $2n-1$. So the 200th term is $2\\cdot200-1=399$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{399} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$."
