At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let x be Jane's age one year ago. Then her age one year from now will be \\(x + 2\\).\n\n**Step 2**: Since the number of years in Jane's age one year ago was a perfect square, we can write \\(x = n^2\\) for some integer n.\n\n**Step 3**: Since Jane's age one year from now will be a perfect cube, we can write \\(x + 2 = m^3\\) for some integer m.\n\n**Step 4**: Substituting the expression for \\(x\\) from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3, we get \\(n^2 + 2 = m^3\\).\n\n**Step 5**: Since the only integer solutions to the equation \\(n^2 + 2 = m^3\\) are \\(n = 1\\) and \\(m = 1\\), we must have \\(x = n^2 = 1\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old."
