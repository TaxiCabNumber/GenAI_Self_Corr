At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many perfect squares are factors of 180?",
        "inference": "1. The prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5.\n2. A perfect square has a prime factorization in which all exponents are even.\n3. The only exponents in the prime factorization of 180 that are even are 2 and 3.\n4. Therefore, there are 2 perfect squares that are factors of 180: 4 and 9.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$.  An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180.  An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even.  Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\\cdot3^0$, $2^0\\cdot3^2$, $2^2\\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\\cdot3^2$."
