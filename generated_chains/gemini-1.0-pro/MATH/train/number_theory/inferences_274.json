At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place are divisible by $15$?",
        "inference": "First, let's find the number of three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place. This can be done by multiplying the number of choices for the hundreds place ($9$, since $0$ cannot be used) by the number of choices for the tens place ($10$) and the number of choices for the units place ($1$, since $5$ is already fixed). So, there are $9 \\times 10 \\times 1 = 90$ such integers.\n\nNext, let's find the number of three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $3$. Since $15 = 3 \\times 5$, any three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place that is divisible by $15$ must also be divisible by $3$. To be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$. The sum of the digits of a three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place is equal to the sum of the digits of the hundreds and tens place plus $5$. So, we need to find the number of pairs of digits that sum to a multiple of $3$.\n\nThere are $4$ such pairs: $(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (0, 3)$. So, there are $4 \\times 10 = 40$ three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $3$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $5$. Since $15 = 3 \\times 5$, any three-digit integer with a $5$ in the units place that is divisible by $15$ must also be divisible by $5$. To be divisible by $5$, the units digit must be $0$ or $5$. So, there are $2 \\times 10 \\times 1 = 20$ three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $5$.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$ is $40$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15."
