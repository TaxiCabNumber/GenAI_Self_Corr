        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
        "inference": "Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. \n\nSo, the party was on the $1000$th day of her life, which is $1000 - 1 = 999$ days after her birth.\n\nTo find the day of the week of the party, we need to know how many days are in a week. There are $7$ days in a week.\n\nWe can divide $999$ by $7$ to find how many weeks are in $999$ days. $999 \\div 7 = 142$ weeks with a remainder of $5$ days.\n\nThis means that the party was $5$ days after the start of the $142$nd week.\n\nSince the party was $5$ days after the start of the $142$nd week, and the week starts on Sunday, the party was on **Friday**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$Friday$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$."
