At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?",
        "inference": "5 is a factor of 100, so the multiples of 5 less than 100 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95. Among these, the ones with a units digit of 5 are: 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5."
