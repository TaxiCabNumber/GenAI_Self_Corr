At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct four-digit numbers are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits?",
        "inference": "1. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n2. The sum of the digits of a four-digit number ending in 23 is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of the first two digits is divisible by 3.\n3. There are 10 choices for the first digit (0-9), and 3 choices for the second digit (1, 4, 7) to make the sum of the first two digits divisible by 3.\n4. There is only one choice for the last two digits (23).\n5. Therefore, there are $10 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 30$ distinct four-digit numbers divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3."
