        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA number $n$ has $3$ divisors. How many divisors does $n^2$ have?",
        "inference": "$n=p^a$, $p$ is a prime, $a$ is a positive integer. \n\nThe divisors of $n$ are $1, p, p^2$ The divisors of $n^2$ are $1, p, p^2,p^3,p^4$. \n\nThe number of divisors of $n^2$ is $3+1=\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime. Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number. As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime. Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$."
