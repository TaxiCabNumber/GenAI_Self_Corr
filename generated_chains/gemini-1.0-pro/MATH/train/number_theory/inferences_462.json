At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe decimal expansion of $8/11$ is a repeating decimal. What is the least number of digits in a repeating block of 8/11?",
        "inference": "First, we find the remainder of 8 divided by 11: $8\\div11=0$ remainder $8$. \n\nThen, we bring down the remainder: $8.0\\div11=0$ remainder $8$. \n\nRepeating this process gives us: $8.00\\div11=0$ remainder $8$ and $8.000\\div11=0$ remainder $8$. \n\nWe see that the remainder is always $8$, so the decimal expansion of $8/11$ is $0.\\overline{8}$. \n\nThe repeating block consists of 1 digit, so the least number of digits in a repeating block of $8/11$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
