At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlicia has $n$ candies, where $n$ is a positive integer with three digits. If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$. If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
        "inference": "Let's consider $n$ modulo $8$ and $5$.\n\nIf $n+5$ is a multiple of $8$, then $n+5$ is in the form of $8k$ for some integer $k$. So, $n$ is in the form of $8k-5$.\n\nIf $n-8$ is a multiple of $5$, then $n-8$ is in the form of $5m$ for some integer $m$. So, $n$ is in the form of $5m+8$.\n\nTherefore, we have $8k-5=5m+8$.\n\n$8k=5m+13$.\n\nSince $k$ and $m$ are integers, $5m+13$ must be divisible by $8$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer divisible by $8$ is $8$. So, $5m+13=8$.\n\n$5m=-5$.\n\n$m=-1$.\n\nTherefore, $n=5m+8=5(-1)+8=\\boxed{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits."
