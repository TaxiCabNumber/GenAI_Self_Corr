At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
        "inference": "The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\nSince the sum of all the positive factors of $x$ is 24, we have:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 24 = 58$$\nSince one of the factors is 3, we have:\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 = 36$$\nSo, we have:\n$$x = 36$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$."
