At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the 25th day of the year 2003 falls on a Saturday, on what day of the week did the 284th day of the year 2003 fall?",
        "inference": "**1. Convert the days to the number of weeks and days:**\n284 days = 40 weeks and 4 days\n25 days = 3 weeks and 4 days\n\n**2. Subtract the number of weeks and days to find the time difference:**\nTime difference = (40 weeks - 3 weeks) + (4 days - 4 days) = 37 weeks\n\n**3. Multiply the number of weeks by 7 (days in a week) to find the number of days:**\nElapsed days = 37 weeks * 7 days/week = 259 days\n\n**4. Find the remainder of the elapsed days divided by 7 to find the number of extra days:**\nRemainder = 259 days % 7 days = 0 days\n\n**5. Since there are no extra days, the day of the week remains the same. Therefore, the 284th day of 2003 also falls on Saturday.**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{Saturday}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$."
