At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many perfect squares less than 1000 have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4?",
        "inference": "The perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2 are: 2\n\nThe perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 3 are: 3, 23\n\nThe perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 4 are: 4, 14, 24, 44, 54, 64, 74\n\nSo, there are $1+2+7=10$ perfect squares less than 1000 with a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
