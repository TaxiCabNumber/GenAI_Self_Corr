At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe operation $\\star$ is defined as $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$. For how many integer values of $x$ will the value of $10 \\star x$ be a positive integer?",
        "inference": "1. We know that $a \\star b = a^2 \\div b$. So, $10 \\star x = 10^2 \\div x = 100 \\div x$.\n2. For $10 \\star x$ to be a positive integer, $100 \\div x$ must be a positive integer.\n3. This means that $x$ must be a positive integer that divides $100$.\n4. The positive integers that divide $100$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50$, and $100$.\n5. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ integer values of $x$ for which $10 \\star x$ is a positive integer.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $10 \\star x = n$ a positive integer, then $10^2 = 100 = nx$. In other words, $x$ must be a positive integer divisor of 100. Since 100 factors as $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$, its exponents tell us that it has $(2+1)(2+1) = \\boxed{9}$ positive divisors."
