I hope it is correct.'\nEach pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of packs of hot dogs and $y$ be the number of packs of hot dog buns.\n\nWe have $10x$ hot dogs and $8y$ buns.\n\nWe have 4 hot dogs left over.  This means that $10x - 8y = 4$.\n\nSolving for $y$ in terms of $x$, we get $y = \\frac{10}{8}x - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe want to find the second smallest possible value of $x$.\n\nWe know that $y$ must be an integer, since it represents the number of packs of buns.\n\nWe also know that $x$ must be an integer, since it represents the number of packs of hot dogs.\n\nTherefore, $5x - 2$ must be divisible by $4$.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $5x - 2$ that is divisible by $4$ is $2$.\n\nTherefore, $5x = 4$, so $x = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nHowever, since $x$ must be an integer, this is not a valid solution.\n\nThe next smallest possible value of $5x - 2$ that is divisible by $4$ is $6$.\n\nTherefore, $5x = 6$, so $x = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n\nAgain, since $x$ must be an integer, this is not a valid solution.\n\nThe next smallest possible value of $5x - 2$ that is divisible by $4$ is $10$.\n\nTherefore, $5x = 10$, so $x = 2$.\n\nThis is a valid solution, since $x$ is an integer and $\\frac{5}{4}x - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{4}(2) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}$ is also an integer.\n\nTherefore, the second smallest possible value of $x$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$."
