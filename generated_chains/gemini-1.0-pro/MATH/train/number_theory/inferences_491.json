        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of the digits in the base 8 representation of $6543_{10}$?",
        "inference": "The base 8 representation of $6543_{10}$ is $12353_8$.\nThe product of the digits is $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 90$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$90$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To convert to base 8, we realize $8^{5}>6543_{10}>8^{4}$. So, we can tell that $6543_{10}$ in base eight will have five digits. $8^{4}=4096$, which can go into 6543 only one time at most, leaving $6543-1\\cdot4096 = 2447$ for the next four digits. $8^{3}=512$ goes into 2447 four times at most, leaving us with $2447-4\\cdot512 = 399$. Then, $8^{2}=64$ goes into 399 six times at most, leaving $399-6\\cdot64 = 15$. Next, we have $8^{1}=8$, which can go into 15 one time, leaving $15-1\\cdot8 = 7$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $6543_{10}$ is $14617_{8}$.  We are looking for the product of the digits, which is $1\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot1\\cdot7 = \\boxed{168}$."
