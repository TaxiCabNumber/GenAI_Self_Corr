At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Since $15n$ is a perfect square, $n$ must be a multiple of $15$. \nThe multiples of $15$ less than or equal to $1000$ are $15, 30, 45, ..., 1000$. \nThere are $\\frac{1000}{15} = 66.666... \\approx 67$ multiples of $15$ less than or equal to $1000$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{67}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$)."
