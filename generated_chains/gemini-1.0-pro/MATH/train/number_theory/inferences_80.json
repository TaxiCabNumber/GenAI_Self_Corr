At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $n$ is a positive integer, and given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, what is $n$?",
        "inference": "Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$, then $n$ is a multiple of $24$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $24$, then $n=24k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nSince $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, then $108$ is a multiple of $n$. Since $108$ is a multiple of $n$, then $108=nk$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nTherefore, $108=24k^2$. Dividing both sides by $24$, we get $4.5=k^2$.

This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.\n\nSimilarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.\n\nThe only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself. Thus, $n=\\boxed{36}$."
