        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a class of math students lined up for a class picture on Picture Day, they found that when they stood in rows of four there was one person left over. When they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and when they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over. What is the fewest number of students possible in this class?",
        "inference": "Let the number of students in the class be $x$.\nWhen they stood in rows of four, there was one person left over. So, $x$ is one more than a multiple of four.\n$x = 4k + 1$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nWhen they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students. So, $x$ is two more than a multiple of five.\n$x = 5m + 2$, where $m$ is a positive integer.\n\nWhen they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over. So, $x$ is three more than a multiple of seven.\n$x = 7n + 3$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\n\nSince $x$ is the same for all three cases, we can set the three equations equal to each other and solve for $k$, $m$, and $n$.\n$4k + 1 = 5m + 2 = 7n + 3$\n\nSolving the system of equations gives $k = 2$, $m = 3$, and $n = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation for $x$, we get\n$x = 4(2) + 1 = 5(3) + 2 = 7(1) + 3 = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the fewest number of students possible in this class is $\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first two pieces of information imply that the number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 4 and 2 more than a multiple of 5. Checking numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5, we find that 2, 7, and 12 are not 1 more than a multiple of 4, but 17 does satisfy this condition. Moreover, 17 is also three more than a multiple of 7. Thus $\\boxed{17}$ is the least positive integer satisfying all three conditions.\n\nRemark: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers satisfying the given conditions are of the form $17 + \\text{lcm}(4,5,7)k = 17+140k$, where $k$ is an integer."
