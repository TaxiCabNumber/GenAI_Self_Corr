At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nPowers of 3:\n$1,3,9,27,81,243,\\cdots$\n\nSums of distinct powers of 3:\n$4=1+3$,\n$10=3+3+3+1$,\n$12=9+3$.\n\nAs the powers of 3 increase, the number of sums of distinct powers of 3 that fall between each pair of powers of 3 increases as well. For example, there is only one sum of distinct powers of 3 between $3$ and $9$, but there are three sums of distinct powers of 3 between $9$ and $27$.\n\nThe $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of the sequence must be either a power of $3$ or a sum of distinct powers of $3$. Since $243=3^5$ is the largest power of $3$ less than $100$, the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term must be a sum of distinct powers of $3$.\n\nSince the sum of all the powers of $3$ up to $243$ is $243+81+27+9+3+1=364$, the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term must be $100-364=-264$. Since there are no negative terms in the sequence, the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term must be the first term, $1$.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$."
