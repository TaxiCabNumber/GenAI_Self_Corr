        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $x$ be the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3. Then 412 + $x$ = 3k for some positive integer $k$.\n\nSince 412 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, we have 412 + $x$ is congruent to $x$ modulo 3. Therefore, $x$ must be congruent to 3 modulo 3.\n\nThe least positive integer congruent to 3 modulo 3 is 3 itself.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412."
