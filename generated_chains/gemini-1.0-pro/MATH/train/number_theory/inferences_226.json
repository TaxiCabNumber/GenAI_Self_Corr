        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$?",
        "inference": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.076923076923...$, which is a repeating decimal with a period of $6$.\n\nSo, the 43rd digit after the decimal point is the same as the 5th digit in the period, which is $9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer."
