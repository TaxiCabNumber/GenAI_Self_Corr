        "ground_truth": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions."
