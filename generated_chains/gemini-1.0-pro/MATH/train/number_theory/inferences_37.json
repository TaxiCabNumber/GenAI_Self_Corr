        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integers $n\\geq 2$ is $1001_n$ a prime number?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $1001_n$ is divisible by $1001=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13$, it is a prime number if and only if $n$ is divisible by $7$, $11$, or $13$.\nThe smallest values of $n$ that are divisible by $7$, $11$, or $13$ are $n=7$, $n=11$, and $n=13$, respectively.\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ positive integers $n\\geq2$ for which $1001_n$ is a prime number.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$."
