At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers in the sequence $101$, $104$, $109$, $116$,$\\ldots$ are of the form $a_n=100+n^2$, where $n=1,2,3,\\ldots$ For each $n$, let $d_n$ be the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$. Find the maximum value of $d_n$ as $n$ ranges through the positive integers.\n",
        "inference": "The greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n+1}$ is the greatest common divisor of $100+n^2$ and $100+(n+1)^2$. This is the same as the greatest common divisor of $100+n^2$ and $2n+1$. Thus, we want to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of $100+n^2$ and $2n+1$ as $n$ ranges through the positive integers.\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $100+n^2$ and $2n+1$. We have\n\n$$100+n^2=2n(2n+1)+(100-4n^2-2n)$$\n\n$$2n+1=100-4n^2-2n+(4n^2+2n)$$\n\n$$100-4n^2-2n=25-4n^2-2n$$\n\n$$25-4n^2-2n=25-4n(n+1/2)$$\n\n$$25-4n(n+1/2)=25-4(n^2+n/2)$$\n\n$$25-4(n^2+n/2)=25-4(n+1/2)(n-1/2)$$\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $100+n^2$ and $2n+1$ is $25-4(n+1/2)(n-1/2)$. The maximum value of this expression occurs when $n=1/2$. Thus, the maximum value of $d_n$ is $25-4(1+1/2)(1-1/2)=\\boxed{9}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $(x,y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then we have $d_n=(a_n,a_{n+1})=(100+n^2,100+n^2+2n+1)$. Now assuming that $d_n$ divides $100+n^2$, it must divide $2n+1$ if it is going to divide the entire expression $100+n^2+2n+1$.\nThus the equation turns into $d_n=(100+n^2,2n+1)$. Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.\nSo $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$. It simplified the way we wanted it to! Now using similar techniques we can write $d_n=(-2(2n+1)+401,2n+1)=(401,2n+1)$. Thus $d_n$ must divide $\\boxed{401}$ for every single $n$. This means the largest possible value for $d_n$ is $401$, and we see that it can be achieved when $n = 200$."
