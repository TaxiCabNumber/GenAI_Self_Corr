At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. What is the least number of stamps he can combine so the value of the stamps is 33 cents?",
        "inference": "Bryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. Let's say he has $x$ 3-cent stamps and $y$ 4-cent stamps.\n\nThe total value of his stamps is $3x + 4y$ cents\n\nWe want the least number of stamps he can combine so that the value of the stamps is 33 cents.\n\nSo, we want to find the smallest number of stamps that satisfy the equation:\n\n$$3x + 4y = 33$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$$3x = 33 - 4y$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{33 - 4y}{3}$$\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the smallest value of $y$ that makes $x$ an integer is $y=2$.\n\nWhen $y=2$, $x=9$.\n\nSo, Bryan can combine the least number of stamps, which is $9$ 3-cent stamps and $2$ 4-cent stamps, to get a total value of $33$ cents.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps."
