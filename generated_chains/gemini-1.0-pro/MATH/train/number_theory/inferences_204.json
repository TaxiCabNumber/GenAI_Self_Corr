At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of $23^{23}$?",
        "inference": "$23^{23}$ ends in $3$ and $23^2$ ends in $9$. Thus, $23^{23}$ = $23^{22} * 23$ ends in $3 * 3$ = $9$. Therefore, the final digit is $9$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
