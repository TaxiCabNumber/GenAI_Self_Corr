At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two. Find the sum of all possible values of $N$.\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet's represent the three integers as $x$, $y$, and $z$. We know that $x + y + z = \\frac{N}{6}$. Since one of the integers is the sum of the other two, we can write $z = x + y$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $x + y + (x + y) = \\frac{N}{6} \\Rightarrow 2(x + y) = \\frac{N}{6} \\Rightarrow x + y = \\frac{N}{12}$. Substituting this into $z = x + y$, we get $z = \\frac{N}{12}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the product of the three integers: $N = xyz = x(x + y)(x + y + z) = x\\left(\\frac{N}{12}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{12} + \\frac{N}{12}\\right) = \\frac{N^3}{1728}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1728}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the three integers be $a, b, c$. $N = abc = 6(a + b + c)$ and $c = a + b$. Then $N = ab(a + b) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 12(a + b)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$."
