        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIf $a,b,$ and $c$ are integers with $1<c<b<a$ and the volume of the box is 240 cubic units, then we have $abc=240$.  Since $c<b<a$, we have $c^2<bc<ac<a^2$.  Since $c^2<bc$, we have $c<b$.  Since $bc<ac$, we have $b<a$.  Since $ac<a^2$, we have $c<a$.  Therefore, we have $c<b<a$.  Since $c<b$ and $bc=240$, we have $c=1$ or $c=2$.  Since $c=2$ and $bc=240$, we have $b=120$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{120}$.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$."
