At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of such an integer must be $p^4$, where $p$ is prime. The factors are $1$, $p$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$. So the least such integer is $2^4=$ **8**.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$."
