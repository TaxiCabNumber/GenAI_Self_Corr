        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1:** Convert 200 and 1200 to base 2.\n\n200 = 11001000\n1200 = 10010110000\n\n**Step 2:** Count the number of digits in each number.\n\n200 has 8 digits.\n1200 has 11 digits.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the number of digits in 200 from the number of digits in 1200.\n\n11 - 8 = 3\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations."
