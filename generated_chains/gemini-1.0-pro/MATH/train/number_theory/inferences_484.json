At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou recently bought more than 100 eggs. The eggs are sorted in containers that can store exactly 12 eggs. However, upon inspecting the containers, you realize that two containers each hold only 11 eggs, while all the other containers hold 12 eggs. What is the smallest number of eggs you could have right now?",
        "inference": "I know that I have at least 100 eggs, and that some of the eggs are in containers that hold 12 eggs, while 2 containers hold 11 eggs. I want to determine the smallest possible number of eggs I could have.\n\nLet x be the number of containers that hold 12 eggs.\n\nThen, the total number of eggs in the containers that hold 12 eggs is 12x.\n\nAnd, the total number of eggs in the 2 containers that hold 11 eggs is 11 * 2 = 22.\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs I have is 12x + 22.\n\nI know that I have at least 100 eggs, so:\n\n12x + 22 >= 100\n\nSolving for x:\n\n12x >= 78\n\nx >= 6.5\n\nSince x must be an integer, the smallest possible value of x is 7.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of containers that hold 12 eggs is 7.\n\nThe total number of eggs in these containers is 7 * 12 = 84.\n\nAdd the 22 eggs in the containers that hold 11 eggs:\n\n84 + 22 = 106\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{106}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$."
