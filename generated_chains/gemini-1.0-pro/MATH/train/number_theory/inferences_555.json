        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can factor $n^3+100$ as $(n+10)(n^2-10n+10)$ by Vieta's formulas.  Since $n+10$ is a factor of $n^3+100$, we must have $n^2-10n+10$ is an integer.  This means that $10n-n^2$ is a perfect square.  Therefore, $n(10-n)$ is a perfect square.  Since $0 \\le n \\le 9$ (as $n$ is a positive integer), the only possible perfect squares are $0$, $1$, and $4$.  If $n(10-n)=0$, then $n=0$ or $n=10$.  If $n(10-n)=1$, then $n$ is a positive integer less than $10$ such that $n$ and $10-n$ are both $1$.  The only such integer is $n=5$.  If $n(10-n)=4$, then $n$ is a positive integer less than $10$ such that $n$ and $10-n$ are both $2$.  The only such integer is $n=4$.  Therefore, the only possible values of $n$ are $0$, $4$, $5$, and $10$.  We can check that $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$ when $n=0$, $4$, or $5$, but not when $n=10$.  Therefore, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$."
