At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004. What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$?",

Then, the sum $x + y + z$ is minimized when the factors of 2004 are as close as possible to each other.\nThe prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. Therefore, the three factors are $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 167$.\nThe sum of the three factors is $x + y + z = 2 + 3 + 167 = 172$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{172}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$."
