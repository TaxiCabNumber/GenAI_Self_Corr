At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn base $b$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct. (That's \"one hundred\" in the ordinary sense, $100_{10}$.)\n\nWhat is $b$?",
        "inference": "Let $d(n)$ be the number of distinct digits of $n$ in base $b$. If $n$ is a three-digit number, then $d(n)\\leq 3$. The number of three-digit numbers in base $b$ is $b^3$. Thus, the number of three-digit numbers in base $b$ with $d(n) = 3$ is $b^3 - b^2$. The number of three-digit numbers in base $b$ with $d(n) = 2$ is $b(b-1)b^2$ (since the first digit can be any of $b$ digits, but the other two digits must be different from the first). The number of three-digit numbers in base $b$ with $d(n) = 1$ is $b(b-1)^2$ (since the first and second digits must be different, but the third digit can be any of $b-2$ digits). Thus, the total number of three-digit numbers in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct is $b^3 - b^2 + b(b-1)b^2 + b(b-1)^2$. We are given that this is equal to $100_{10}$, so we have \\begin{align*}\nb^3 - b^2 + b(b-1)b^2 + b(b-1)^2 &= 100_{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^3 + b^2(b-1) + b(b-1)^2 &= 100_{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^3 + b^2(b-1) + b(b^2-2b+1) &= 100_{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^3 + b^3-b^2 + b^3 - 2b^2 + b &= 100_{10}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3b^3 - 4b^2 + b - 100 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (3b - 5)(b^2 + b - 20) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3b - 5 = 0 \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad b^2 + b - 20 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad b = \\frac{5}{3} \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad b = 4 \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad b = -5.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $b$ must be a positive integer, we have $b = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation!
