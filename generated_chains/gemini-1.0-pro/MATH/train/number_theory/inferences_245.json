At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 100 are both a square and a cube?",

The next cube after 27 is 64 which is both a square and a cube. The only other cube less than 100 is 81 which is both a square and a cube.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube."
