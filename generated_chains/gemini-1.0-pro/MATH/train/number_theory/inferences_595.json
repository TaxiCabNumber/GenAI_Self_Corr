I hope it is correct.'\nThe decimal representation of $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n,$ contains the digits $2, 5$, and $1$ consecutively, and in that order. Find the smallest value of $n$ for which this is possible.\n",
        "inference": "Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, the decimal expansion of $m/n$ is terminating and contains no repeating blocks of digits. Therefore, the digits $2, 5$, and $1$ must occur in that order at the end of the decimal expansion. The last digit of the decimal expansion of $m/n$ is the remainder when $m$ is divided by $n$. Therefore, $m$ must be $1$ more than a multiple of $n$. The digit before the last digit is the remainder when $m$ is divided by $n$. Therefore, $m$ must be $5$ more than a multiple of $n$. The digit before that is the remainder when $m$ is divided by $n$. Therefore, $m$ must be $2$ more than a multiple of $n$. These three conditions are equivalent to $m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, $m \\equiv 5 \\pmod{n}$, and $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{n}$. The smallest $n$ that satisfies these three conditions is $n = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
