        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe integers between 0 and 8 inclusive are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThe inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $b$ such that $ab \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$.\nWe can check which of the integers between 0 and 8 have an inverse modulo 9:\n- 0 has no inverse because $0b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ for any integer $b$.\n- 1 has an inverse of 1 because $1 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 2 has an inverse of 5 because $2 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 3 has an inverse of 3 because $3 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 4 has an inverse of 7 because $4 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 5 has an inverse of 2 because $5 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 6 has an inverse of 6 because $6 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 7 has an inverse of 4 because $7 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\n- 8 has an inverse of 8 because $8 \\cdot 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.\nTherefore, there are 6 integers between 0 and 8 inclusive that have an inverse modulo 9.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.
