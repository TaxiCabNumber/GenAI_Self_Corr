At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $0.\\overline{42}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Converting $0.\\overline{42}$ to a fraction:\n\n$$0.\\overline{42} = 0.424242 \\cdots = \\frac{42}{100}+\\frac{42}{10000}+\\frac{42}{1000000}+\\cdots$$\n\nThis is a geometric series with $a=42/100$ and $r=1/100$. The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by $S=\\frac{a}{1-r}$, so we have:\n\n$$0.\\overline{42} = \\frac{42/100}{1-1/100} = \\frac{42}{99}$$\n\nTherefore, $a=42$ and $b=99$ so $a+b=42+99 = 141$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{141}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{42}$. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 42.\\overline{42}$. Subtracting these two equations gives $99x = 42$, so $x = \\frac{42}{99} = \\frac{14}{33}$. Thus $a+b = 14+33 = \\boxed{47}$."
