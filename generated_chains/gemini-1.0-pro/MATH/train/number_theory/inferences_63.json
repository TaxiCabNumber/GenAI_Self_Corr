Observe that the decimal part of $\\frac{3}{26}$ is a repeating decimal with a period of 6.\nSolution: The repeating part is $115384$.\n\n3. Find the remainder when $100$ is divided by $6$.\nSolution: $100\\div 6=16$ remainder $4$.\n\n4. The $100$th digit after the decimal point is the $4$th digit in the repeating block.\nSolution: The $4$th digit in $115384$ is $5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$."
