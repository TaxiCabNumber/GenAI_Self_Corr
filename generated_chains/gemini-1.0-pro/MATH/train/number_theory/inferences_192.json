        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction $\\frac{1}{129}$?",
        "inference": "1. Divide 1 by 129 to find the decimal representation of the fraction.\n2. The first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point is the first digit of the repeating block of digits in the decimal representation.\n3. Divide 100 by 129 to find the repeating block of digits.\n4. The first nonzero digit in the repeating block of digits is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we multiply this fraction by 10, we do not change any of the digits; we simply shift all the digits one place to the left. Therefore, if we multiply the fraction by a sufficiently large power of 10, then the first digit obtained when dividing by 129 will be the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$. Observing that $100 < 129 < 1000$, we compute $\\frac{1000}{129}=7 \\frac{97}{129}$. So the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
