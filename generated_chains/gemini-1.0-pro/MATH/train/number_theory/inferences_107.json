I hope it is correct.'\nA whole number is said to be ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5. What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number $n$. We know that $n$ is a three-digit number, so $100 \\le n \\le 999$. We also know that $n$ is 9-heavy, so $n \\equiv a \\pmod{9}$ where $a > 5$. We can write $n = 9q + a$, where $q$ is the quotient when $n$ is divided by 9. Substituting this into the first inequality, we get $100 \\le 9q + a \\le 999$. Subtracting $a$ from all sides, we get $100 - a \\le 9q \\le 999 - a$. Dividing all sides by 9, we get $\\frac{100 - a}{9} \\le q \\le \\frac{999 - a}{9}$. Since $q$ is an integer, we have $\\frac{100 - a}{9} \\le q \\le \\frac{999 - a}{9} - 1$. Solving for $a$, we get $\\frac{100 - q}{9} \\le a \\le \\frac{999 - 9q}{9} - 1$. Since $a > 5$, we have $\\frac{100 - q}{9} > 5$. Solving for $q$, we get $q < 100 - 45 = 55$. Since $q$ is an integer, we have $q \\le 54$. Substituting this into the first inequality, we get $100 \\le 9q + a \\le 9 \\cdot 54 + a$. Subtracting $a$ from all sides, we get $100 - a \\le 9q \\le 486$. Dividing all sides by 9, we get $\\frac{100 - a}{9} \\le q \\le \\frac{486}{9}$. Since $q$ is an integer, we have $\\frac{100 - a}{9} \\le q \\le \\frac{486}{9} - 1$. Solving for $a$, we get $\\frac{100 - q}{9} \\le a \\le \\frac{486 - 9q}{9} - 1$. Since $a > 5$, we have $\\frac{100 - q}{9} > 5$. Solving for $q$, we get $q < 100 - 45 = 55$. Since $q$ is an integer, we have $q \\le 54$. Therefore, the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number is $9 \\cdot 54 + 6 = 486$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{486}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9."
