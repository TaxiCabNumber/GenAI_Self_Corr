At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive integer divisors of 175, except 1, are arranged around a circle so that every pair of adjacent integers has a common factor greater than 1. What is the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7?",
        "inference": "Factors of 175 are 1, 5, 7, 25, 35, and 175. The only pairs with common factors greater than 1 are 7 and 25, and 35 and 175.\nTherefore, the integers adjacent to 7 are 25 and 35, and their sum is 25 + 35 = 60.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$175=5^2\\cdot7^1$. To arrange the divisors of 175, we can (conveniently) start with the divisor 7. Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, the two divisors that are adjacent to 7 must be multiples of 7, which means they have to be $5^1\\cdot7=35$ and $5^2\\cdot7=175$. Thus, the sum of the two integers adjacent to 7 is $35+175=\\boxed{210}$."
