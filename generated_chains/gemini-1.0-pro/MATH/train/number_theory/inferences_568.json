        "inference": "The divisors of $75$ are $1,3,5,15,25,75$.  The number of divisors of $n$ is the product of the number of divisors of each of the prime factors of $n$.

Since $n$ is a multiple of $75$, it has at least $12$ positive integral divisors, including $1$ and itself.  Therefore, $n$ does not have exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, so there is no such number $n$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{no such number}}$",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power.
