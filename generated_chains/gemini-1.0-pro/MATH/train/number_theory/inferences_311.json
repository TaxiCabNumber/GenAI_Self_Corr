        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFirst, we compute $5^3 = 125$, so the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ will be the same as the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993 \\mod 3}$.  By the division algorithm, $1993 = 3 \\cdot 664 + 1$, so $1993 \\mod 3 = 1$.  Therefore, the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ are the same as the rightmost three digits of $5^1 = 5$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{005}$. I hope it is correct.**",
