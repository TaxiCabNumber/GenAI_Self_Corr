        "inference": "We can write $15 + 22k = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, where $k$, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers. Solving for $d$, we get $d = 15 + 22k - 1000a - 100b - 10c = 15 - 1000(a - 22k) - 100(b + 22k) - 10c = 15 - 1000m - 100n - 10c$, where $m = a - 22k$ and $n = b + 22k$. Since $d$ is a digit, we have $0 \\le d \\le 9$, so $15 - 1000m - 100n - 10c \\le 9$. Solving for $m$, we get $m \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{1000}(15 - 100n - 10c) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1000}(5 - 10n - c)$. Since $m$ is an integer, we have $m \\ge 1 - \\frac{1}{1000}(5 - 10n - c) = 2$, so $1 - \\frac{1}{1000}(5 - 10n - c) \\ge 2$. Solving for $c$, we get $c \\le 5 - 10n - \\frac{1}{1000}$. Since $c$ is a digit, we have $0 \\le c \\le 9$, so $0 \\le 5 - 10n - \\frac{1}{1000} \\le 9$. Solving for $n$, we get $n \\le \\frac{1}{10}(5 - \\frac{1}{1000}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $n$ is an integer, we have $n = 0$. Therefore, $c = 5$. Substituting $n = 0$ into $d = 15 - 1000m - 100n - 10c$, we get $d = 15 - 1000m - 10(5) = 15 - 1000m - 50 = 1000(1 - m) - 35$. Since $d$ is a digit, we have $0 \\le d \\le 9$, so $1000(1 - m) - 35 \\le 9$. Solving for $m$, we get $m \\le 1 + \\frac{44}{1000} = 1.044$. Since $m$ is an integer, we have $m = 1$. Therefore, $d = 1000(1 - m) - 35 = 1000(1 - 1) - 35 = -35$. Since $d$ is a digit, we have $-35 \\le d \\le 9$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no $4$-digit integer congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\infty}$. I hope it is correct.",
