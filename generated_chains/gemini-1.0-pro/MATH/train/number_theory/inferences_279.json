        "inference": "First, we find the multiplicative inverse of $4$ modulo $27$. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n27 &= 4(6) + 3\\\\\n4 &= 3(1) + 1\\\\\n3 &= 1(3) + 0\\\\\n1 &= 3(0) + 1\\\\\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSo, $1 = 3(0) + 1 = 3(0) + 1(4) - 3(1)(4) = 1(4) - 3(1)(4)$, which gives us $1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{27}$.\n\nNow, we can solve the congruence $4x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$ by multiplying both sides by $1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{27}$:\n\n$$4x(1) \\equiv 13(1) \\pmod{27} \\Rightarrow x \\equiv 13(1) \\pmod{27} \\Rightarrow x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{27}$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}.$ I hope it is correct.",
