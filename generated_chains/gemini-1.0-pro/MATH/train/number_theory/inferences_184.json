At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A$ be the set of all numbers which can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$?",
        "inference": "The sum of any three consecutive positive integers is of the form $n+(n+1)+(n+2)$, which simplifies to $3n+3=3(n+1)$. Therefore, all numbers in $A$ are multiples of $3$.\nThe greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ is thus $3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
