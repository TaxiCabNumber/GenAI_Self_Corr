One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",
        "inference": "In one marathon, Leila runs $26$ miles and $385$ yards, or $26 \\cdot 1760 + 385 = 45985$ yards.\n\nIn ten marathons, Leila runs $45985 \\cdot 10 = 459850$ yards.\n\nSince $y < 1760$, the only possible value of $y$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$."
