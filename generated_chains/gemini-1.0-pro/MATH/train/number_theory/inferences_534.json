At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
        "inference": "The positive divisors of $400$ are $1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,25,40,50,80,100,200,400$.\n\nTheir sum is \n\n$$1+2+4+5+8+10+16+20+25+40+50+80+100+200+400=961.$$\n\nThe prime factorization of $961$ is $961=7\\times137$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ has $\\boxed{2}$ distinct prime factors.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor."
