        "inference": "**Step 1:** A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.  Therefore, the digits of $x + 5678$ must be symmetrical.\n**Step 2:** The only single-digit number that is a palindrome is 0.  Therefore, the last digit of $x$ must be 0.\n**Step 3:** Since the last digit of $x$ is 0, the last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 8.  Therefore, the second-to-last digit of $x$ must be 1.\n**Step 4:** Since the second-to-last digit of $x$ is 1, the second-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 6.  Therefore, the third-to-last digit of $x$ must be 7.\n**Step 5:** Since the third-to-last digit of $x$ is 7, the third-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 5.  Therefore, the fourth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 6.\n**Step 6:** Since the fourth-to-last digit of $x$ is 6, the fourth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 6.  Therefore, the fifth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 5.\n**Step 7:** Since the fifth-to-last digit of $x$ is 5, the fifth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 7.  Therefore, the sixth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 6.\n**Step 8:** Since the sixth-to-last digit of $x$ is 6, the sixth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 1.  Therefore, the seventh-to-last digit of $x$ must be 7.\n**Step 9:** Since the seventh-to-last digit of $x$ is 7, the seventh-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 5.  Therefore, the eighth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 6.\n**Step 10:** Since the eighth-to-last digit of $x$ is 6, the eighth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 8.  Therefore, the ninth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 5.\n**Step 11:** Since the ninth-to-last digit of $x$ is 5, the ninth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 7.  Therefore, the tenth-to-last digit of $x$ must be 6.\n**Step 12:** Since the tenth-to-last digit of $x$ is 6, the tenth-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 1.  Therefore, the eleventh-to-last digit of $x$ must be 7.\n**Step 13:** Since the eleventh-to-last digit of $x$ is 7, the eleventh-to-last digit of $x + 5678$ will be 5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome is $x = \\boxed{1765675617}$.\n**Final Answer: $1765675617$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$."
