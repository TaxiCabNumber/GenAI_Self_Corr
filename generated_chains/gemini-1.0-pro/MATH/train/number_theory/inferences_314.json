        "inference": "The smallest four-digit number is $1000$.\n\nSince $33=3\\times11$, to find the smallest four digit number that is divisible by $33$, we need to find the smallest four digit number that is divisible by both $3$ and $11$.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number that is divisible by $3$ is $1002$.\n\nTo find the smallest four digit number that is divisible by $11$, we need to check the divisibility rule for $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ is as follows:\n\n>A number is divisible by $11$ if the sum of the digits in the odd places is equal to the sum of the digits in the even places.\n\nFor the number $1002$, the sum of the digits in the odd places is $1+0=1$, and the sum of the digits in the even places is $0+2=2$.

        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $33$, it needs to be divisible by both $11$ and $3$.\nFor an integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. For it to be divisible by $3$, then $a+b+c+d$ must be divisible by $3$.\nFor our digits to be as small as possible, we want $a-b+c-d$ to be equal to $0$. So $a+c=b+d$. We set $a+c=b+d=x$. Thus, we also have that $2x$ must be divisible by $3$. The smallest even positive integer that's divisible by $3$ is $6$, so $x=3$. Thus we have $a+c=3$ and $b+d=3$.\nFor a number to be as small as possible, we want the left digits to be as small as possible. The smallest number $a$ could be is $1$, so $c=2$. For $b$ and $d$, we want $b$ to be as small as possible since it's a larger place than $d$, so $b=0$ and $d=3$. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{1023}$."
