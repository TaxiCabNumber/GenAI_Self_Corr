        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
        "inference": "The 50th term of the sequence is the 50th positive multiple of 3 that contains a 1 in its digits.\n\nThe first few positive multiples of 3 are:\n$$3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, \\ldots$$\n\nThe first term of the sequence is 12, so the 50th term is the 50th term after 12 in the sequence of positive multiples of 3.\n\nThe next few positive multiples of 3 are:\n$$27, 30, 33, 36, 39, \\ldots$$\n\nThe next term of the sequence is 51, so the 50th term is the 50th term after 51 in the sequence of positive multiples of 3.\n\nThe next few positive multiples of 3 are:\n$$54, 57, 60, 63, 66, \\ldots$$\n\nThe next term of the sequence is 81, so the 50th term is the 50th term after 81 in the sequence of positive multiples of 3.\n\nTherefore, the 50th term of the sequence is $81 + 49 \\times 3 = \\boxed{270}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{270}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$."
