At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many more digits does the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ have than the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$?",
        "inference": "We first convert $987_{10}$ to base 3, which is $10122_3$. We then convert $987_{10}$ to base 8, which is $1577_8$. The base-3 representation has $5$ digits, while the base-8 representation has $4$ digits. Therefore, the base-3 representation has $5-4=\\boxed{1}$ more digit than the base-8 representation.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent."
