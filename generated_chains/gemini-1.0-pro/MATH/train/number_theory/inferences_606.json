At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) represent the number of rows and \\(y\\) represent the number of columns in the rectangular formation. Then, the total number of members is \\(x\\times y\\).\n\nGiven that in a square formation, there are 5 members left over, we have:\n\n$$x^2=y^2+5$$\n\nGiven that in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over, we have:\n\n$$(x+7)\\times(x-7)=y^2$$\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$(x+7)\\times(x-7)=(x^2+5)$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$x^2-49=x^2+5$$\n\n$$-49=5$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution. Therefore, there is no maximum number of members this band can have.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{No\\ solution}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$."
