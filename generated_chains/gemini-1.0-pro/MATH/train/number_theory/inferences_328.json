At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $N$ be the sum of the divisors of $200$. What is the largest prime factor of $N$?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of $200$ is $2^3 \\times 5^2$. The sum of the divisors of $200$ is $(1 + 2 + 4 + 8) \\times (1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 15 \\times 155 = 2325$. The prime factorization of $2325$ is $3^2 \\times 5^3$. The largest prime factor of $2325$ is $5$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $200$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$. It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 5 + 5^2)$, as each factor of $200$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that $N = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 5 + 25) = (15)(31)$. The largest prime factor is $\\boxed{31}$."
