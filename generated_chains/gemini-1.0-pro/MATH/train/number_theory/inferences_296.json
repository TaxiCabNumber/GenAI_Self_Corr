        "inference": "The prime factorization of $4125$ is $3 \\cdot 5^5$. To have $4125$ as a factor of $n!$, $n$ must be at least $16$ (since $5^5$ is divisible by $5!$), and $n$ must be even (since $3$ is divisible by $(2!)(4!) \\cdots (2k!)$ for any positive integer $k$).\n\nThe least even integer greater than or equal to $16$ is $18$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{18}$.

        "ground_truth": "We find the prime factorization of $4125$. $4125= 11 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$. The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \\ge 11$. The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5. Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations. Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$."
