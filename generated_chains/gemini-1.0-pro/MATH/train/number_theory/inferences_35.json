        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt is currently $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00 \\text{ p.m.}$ What time will it be in $6666$ seconds?  (Enter the time in the format \"HH:MM:SS\", without including \"am\" or \"pm\".)",
        "inference": "- First, we need to find the number of minutes in $6666$ seconds. To do this, we divide $6666$ by $60$.\n$$\\frac{6666}{60} = 111.1$$\n\n- Since $111.1$ is not a whole number, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. Rounding $111.1$ to the nearest whole number gives us $111$.\n- So, in $6666$ seconds, there are $111$ minutes.\n\n- Next, we need to find the number of hours in $111$ minutes. To do this, we divide $111$ by $60$.\n$$\\frac{111}{60} = 1.85$$\n\n- Since $1.85$ is not a whole number, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. Rounding $1.85$ to the nearest whole number gives us $2$.\n- So, in $111$ minutes, there are $2$ hours.\n\n- Finally, we need to add the number of hours and minutes to the current time to find the time in $6666$ seconds.\n$$3:00:00 + 2:111:00 = 5:111:00$$\n\n- Therefore, in $6666$ seconds, the time will be $\\boxed{5:111:00}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5:111:00}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$"
