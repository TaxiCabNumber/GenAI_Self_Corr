        "inference": "We first need to find the numbers $x$, $1 \\le x\\le 100,$ for which there exists a positive integer $y$ with $y<x$ such that $\\frac xy$ is an integer.  Since $\\frac xy$ is an integer, $y$ divides $x$.  Thus, $x$ must be a multiple of all the integers $y$ with $1\\le y<x$.  The smallest number that is a multiple of all the integers $1,2,\\ldots,n-1$ is $n!$, so $x$ must be a multiple of $y!$.  Conversely, if $x$ is a multiple of $y!$, then $y$ divides $x$, and since $y<x$, $\\frac xy$ is an integer.  Thus, the numbers $x$ with the desired property are $x=y!$, $1\\le y\\le 99$.\n\nNow we need to determine, for each such $x$, the number of positive integers $y$ with $y<x$ such that $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer. Since $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer, $y+1$ divides $x+1$. Since $y+1<x+1$, we have $y+1\\le \\frac{x+1}{2}$. Thus, $y+1$ must divide $\\frac{x+1}{2}$.  Therefore, $y+1$ must divide both $x+1$ and $\\frac{x+1}{2}$.  The only positive divisors of $\\frac{x+1}{2}$ are $1$, $2$, and $\\frac{x+1}{2}$.  Since $y+1$ divides both $x+1$ and $\\frac{x+1}{2}$, the only possibilities for $y+1$ are $1$ and $2$.  If $y+1=1$, then $y=0$, which is not allowed.  If $y+1=2$, then $y=1$.  Therefore, for each $x$ with $x$ a multiple of $y!$, $1\\le y\\le 99$, there is exactly one positive integer $y$ with $y<x$ such that $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ is an integer.  Thus, the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $y<x\\le 100$ such that $\\frac xy$ and $\\frac{x+1}{y+1}$ are both integers is equal to the number of multiples of $y!$ between $1$ and $100$, which is equal to $\\boxed{99}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{99}$.
