        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
        "inference": "Since the number is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.\nThe sum of two even and two odd digits is odd.\nThe smallest odd multiple of 9 is 9.\nThe smallest four-digit number with an odd sum of digits is 1023.\nBut 1023 is not divisible by 9.\nThe next smallest four-digit number with an odd sum of digits is 1032.\n1032 is divisible by 9.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1032}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$."
