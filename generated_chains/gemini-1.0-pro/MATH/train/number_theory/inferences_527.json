At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be such a debt. \n\nThen $x\\equiv 0\\pmod{300}$ and $x\\equiv 0\\pmod{210}$. \n\nThe smallest positive integer $x$ which satisfies these two congruences is the least common multiple of $300$ and $210$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $300$ is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of $210$ is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. \n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of $300$ and $210$ is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2\\cdot7=\\boxed{4200}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4200}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs."
