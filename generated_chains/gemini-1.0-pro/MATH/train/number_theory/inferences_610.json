At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits. Find the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}.$\n",
        "inference": "We want to find the sum of all numbers in $\\mathcal{S}$. Let $x=0.\\overline{abc}$. Then $1000x=a+0.\\overline{abc}=a+x$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $999x=a$, so $x=\\frac{a}{999}$.\n\nSimilarly, we have $10x=0.0\\overline{abc}=0.\\overline{abc}$, so $10x=x$. Thus $x=0$ or $x=1$. Since $a, b, c$ are distinct digits, we have $a=1, b=2, c=3$ or $a=9, b=8, c=7$. In the first case, $x=\\frac{1}{999}$, and in the second case, $x=\\frac{9}{999}$. Therefore, the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ is $\\frac{1}{999}+\\frac{9}{999}=\\frac{10}{999}=\\frac{100}{9990}=\\frac{1000}{99900}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1000}{99900}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
