        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
        "inference": "Let \\( x\\) be the number of students in each of the three rows with the same number of students. Since the fourth row has one more student, it has \\( x+1\\) students. Since there are over 30 students, we have\n\n$$\n3x + (x+1) > 30\n$$\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get\n\n$$\n4x > 29\n$$\n\n$$\nx > \\frac{29}{4}\n$$\n\n$$\nx > 7.25\n$$\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the smallest possible value of x is \\(8\\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible class size is\n\n$$\n3x + (x+1) = 3(8) + (8+1) = 24 + 9 = \\boxed{33}\n$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{33}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students."
