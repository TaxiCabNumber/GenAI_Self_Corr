At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Divide the total number of hot dogs by the number of hot dogs in each set to find the number of sets. Then, multiply the number of sets by the number of hot dogs in each set to find the total number of hot dogs in the sets. Finally, subtract the total number of hot dogs in the sets from the total number of hot dogs to find the number of hot dogs left over.\n\n**Calculation:**\n```\nNumber of sets = 25,197,624 \u00f7 4 = 6,299,406\nTotal number of hot dogs in sets = 6,299,406 \u00d7 4 = 25,197,624\nNumber of hot dogs left over = 25,197,624 - 25,197,624 = 0\n```\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$0$}.

        "ground_truth": "We look for the remainder when $25,197,624$ is divided by $4$. We could manually divide to see that $4$ divides evenly into $25,197,624$ for a remainder of $0$, but the quicker way is to know the divisibility rule for $4$. If the last two digits of the number form a multiple of $4$, then the number itself is divisible by $4$.  In this case, $24$ is a multiple of $4$, so $25,197,624$ is also a multiple of $4$. That means $\\boxed{0}$ hot dogs will be left over."
