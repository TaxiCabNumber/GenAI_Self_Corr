At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25?",
        "inference": "We can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime p and any integer a, $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. In this case, $p = 5$, so we have $19^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, $19^{1999} \\equiv (19^4)^{499} \\times 19 \\equiv 1^{499} \\times 19 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25 (which is $5^2$) is the same as the remainder of $19$ divided by $5^2$, which is $19$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$. I hope it is correct.",
