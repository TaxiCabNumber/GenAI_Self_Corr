The largest non-negative integer $k$ such that $11k+6<1000$ is $k=89$. Therefore, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are congruent to $6$ (mod $11$) is $89+1=\\boxed{90}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$90$}. I hope it is correct.",

We seek the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $6+11k<1000$. This maximal $k$ is the greatest integer less than $\\frac{1000-6}{11}$, which is 90.
