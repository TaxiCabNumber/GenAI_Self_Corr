At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKyle bought 2 glass bottles that can hold 15 origami stars each. He then bought another 3 identical glass bottles. How many stars must Kyle make to fill all the glass bottles he bought?",
        "inference": "1. The first step is to find the total number of stars that can fit in the 2 glass bottles that Kyle bought initially.\n2. To do this, we can multiply the number of stars that can fit in each bottle (15) by the number of bottles (2).\n3. So, 15 x 2 = 30 stars.\n4. Next, we need to find the total number of stars that can fit in the 3 additional glass bottles that Kyle bought.\n5. To do this, we can multiply the number of stars that can fit in each bottle (15) by the number of bottles (3).\n6. So, 15 x 3 = 45 stars.\n7. Finally, we need to add the number of stars that can fit in the 2 initial bottles to the number of stars that can fit in the 3 additional bottles to find the total number of stars that Kyle must make.\n8. So, 30 + 45 = 75 stars.\nI hope it is correct: 75",
        "ground_truth": "Kyle has 2 + 3 = <<2+3=5>>5 glass bottles.\nHe needs to make 15 x 5 = <<15*5=75>>75 origami stars\n#### 75"
