At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total distance Tim bikes during the week:\nDistance = (Distance to work x 2) x 5 workdays + Weekend bike ride\n= (20 miles x 2) x 5 + 200 miles\n= 40 miles x 5 + 200 miles\n= 200 miles + 200 miles\n= 400 miles\n2. Find the time it takes Tim to bike 400 miles at 25 mph:\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 400 miles / 25 mph\n= 16 hours\nI hope it is correct: $16$ hrs",
        "ground_truth": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16"
