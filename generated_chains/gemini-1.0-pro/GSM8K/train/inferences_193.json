At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelody planted sunflowers from two different seed packets. She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assume the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is x inches.\n2. Since the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than those from Packet B, the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 1.2 * x.\n3. We are given that the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, so we can set up the equation: 1.2 * x = 192.\n4. Solving for x, we get: x = 192 / 1.2 = 160.\n5. Therefore, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B was 160 inches.\n\nI hope it is correct: 160",
        "ground_truth": "The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.\nWe know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.\nTo figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.\n#### 160"
