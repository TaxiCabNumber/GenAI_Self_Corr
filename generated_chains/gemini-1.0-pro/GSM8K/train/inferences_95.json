At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels and so she goes to the bank. After getting back from the bank, she discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. What is the total value of her money now?",
        "inference": "- Alice has 20 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, she has a total of 20 x 25 = 500 cents.\n- She exchanges all of her quarters for nickels. Since there are 5 nickels in a quarter, she will get 5 x 20 = 100 nickels.\n- 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. So, the number of iron nickels is 100 x 20% = 20.\n- The total value of the iron nickels is 20 x $3 = $60.\n- The value of the remaining nickels is 100 - 20 = 80. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, the value of the remaining nickels is 80 x 5 = $4.\n- Therefore, the total value of her money now is $60 + $4 = $64.\nI hope it is correct: $64",
