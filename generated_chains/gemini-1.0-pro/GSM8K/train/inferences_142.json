At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?",
