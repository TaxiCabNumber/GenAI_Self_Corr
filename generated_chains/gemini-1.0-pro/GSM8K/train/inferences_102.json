At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEllie has found an old bicycle in a field and thinks it just needs some oil to work well again.  She needs 10ml of oil to fix each wheel and will need another 5ml of oil to fix the rest of the bike. How much oil does she need in total to fix the bike?",

Ellie also needs 5ml of oil to fix the rest of the bike.\n4. Therefore, Ellie needs 20ml + 5ml = 25ml of oil in total to fix the bike.\n\nI hope it is correct: 25 ml",
        "ground_truth": "Ellie needs 2 wheels * 10ml of oil per wheel = <<2*10=20>>20ml of oil.\nTo fix the rest of the bike as well, she needs 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25ml of oil.\n#### 25"
