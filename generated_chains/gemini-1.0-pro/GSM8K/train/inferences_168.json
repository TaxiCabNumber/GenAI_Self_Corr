At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSilvia\u2019s bakery is offering 10% on advanced orders over $50.00.  She orders 2 quiches for $15.00 each, 6 croissants at $3.00 each and 6 buttermilk biscuits for $2.00 each.  How much will her order be with the discount?",
