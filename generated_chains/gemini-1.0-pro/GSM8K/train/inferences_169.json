At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBorris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?",

Increase the amount of grapes used by 20%.\n15 kg/month * 120% = 18 kg/month\n\n3. Find the amount of grapes used in a year.\n18 kg/month * 12 months = 216 kg/year\nI hope it is correct: 216 kg",
