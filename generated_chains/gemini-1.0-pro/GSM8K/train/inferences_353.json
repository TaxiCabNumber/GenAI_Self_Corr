At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Friday, Remy paid Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture. Later that evening, the company\u2019s accountant discovered that a new intern in the sales department had overcharged Remy. If the cost of a piece of furniture is $134, how much money will Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC reimburse Remy?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total amount that should have been charged for 150 pieces of furniture:\n\n```\nCost per piece * Number of pieces = Total amount\n$134 * 150 = $20,100\n```\n\n2. Subtract the incorrect total amount from the total amount that should have been charged:\n\n```\nTotal amount that should have been charged - Incorrect total amount = Overcharged amount\n$20,100 - $20,700 = $600\n```\n\n3. Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy the overcharged amount:\n\n```\nOvercharged amount = $600\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: $600",
        "ground_truth": "The total cost of all the pieces of furniture should be 134 * 150 = <<134*150=20100>>20100 dollars\nSally\u2019s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy the difference between the total cost and the amount he paid, which is 20700 - 20100 = <<20700-20100=600>>600 dollars\n#### 600"
