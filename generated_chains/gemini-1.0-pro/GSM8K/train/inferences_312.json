At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFarmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the number of emus is x.\n\nAn emu has one head. So, the number of heads in the flock is x.\n\nAn emu has two legs. So, the number of legs in the flock is 2x.\n\nGiven that the total number of heads and legs is 60, we can write an equation:\n\nx + 2x = 60\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n3x = 60\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 20\n\nTherefore, there are **20 emus** in Farmer Brown's flock.\nI hope it is correct: 20 emus",
        "ground_truth": "Each emu has 1+2=<<1+2=3>>3 heads and legs.\nThen the flock has 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 animals.\n#### 20"
