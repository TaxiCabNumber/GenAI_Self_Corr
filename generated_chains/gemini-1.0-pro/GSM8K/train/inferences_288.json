At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to get gym memberships so he can get in shape.  The gym close to his house is close but doesn't have everything he wants so he gets two different gym memberships.  The cheap one costs $10 a month and has a sign-up fee of $50.  The second gym is 3 times more expensive and it has a sign-up fee of 4 months membership.  How much total did he pay in the first year for gym membership?",

So, for the first year, John will pay 10 * 12(months) = $120 for membership and $50 for the sign-up fee, for a total of $170 for the cheap gym.\n\nThe expensive gym costs 3 times more than the cheap gym, which means it costs $10 * 3 = $30 per month. It also has a sign-up fee of 4 months of membership, so John will pay $30 * 4 = $120 for the sign-up fee. For the first year, John will pay $30 * 12(months) = $360 for membership.\n\nSo, the total amount John paid for gym membership in the first year is $170 + $360 = $530.\n\nI hope it is correct: $530",
