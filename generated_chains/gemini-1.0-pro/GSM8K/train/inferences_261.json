        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nYou can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?",
        "inference": "Let's say there are x oranges, y apples, and z watermelons. Since the total number of fruits is 36, we have: x + y + z = 36.\n\nSince the price of 1 orange is $0.50, the total price of the oranges is 0.50x.\n\nSince you bought y apples and 4 apples have the same price as 1 watermelon, then y/4 = z.\n\nThe total price of the apples is y * (price of 1 apple).\n\nThe total price of the watermelons is z * (price of 1 watermelon).\n\nSince the total bill was $66, we have: 0.50x + y * (price of 1 apple) + z * (price of 1 watermelon) = 66.\n\nSubstituting y/4 = z into the equation, we get: 0.50x + y * (price of 1 apple) + (y/4) * (price of 1 watermelon) = 66.\n\nSince you bought the same number of apples and oranges, x = y.\n\nSubstituting x = y into the equation, we get: 0.50y + y * (price of 1 apple) + (y/4) * (price of 1 watermelon) = 66.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 1.50y + (y/4) * (price of 1 watermelon) = 66.\n\nSince the price of 1 watermelon is 4 times the price of 1 apple, (price of 1 watermelon) = 4 * (price of 1 apple).\n\nSubstituting (price of 1 watermelon) = 4 * (price of 1 apple) into the equation, we get: 1.50y + (y/4) * 4 * (price of 1 apple) = 66.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 1.50y + y * (price of 1 apple) = 66.\n\nCombining like terms, we get: 2.50y = 66.\n\nDividing both sides by 2.50, we get: y = 26.4.\n\nTherefore, the price of 1 apple is (price of 1 apple) = 66 - 0.50 * 26.4 / 26.4 = 1.25.\n\nI hope it is correct: $1.25$",
