At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames is a first-year student at a University in Chicago. He has a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. How much money does he spend on coursework materials?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the percentages to decimal form:\n30% = 0.3\n15% = 0.15\n25% = 0.25\n2. Multiply James's budget by each decimal to find how much he spends on each category:\nFood: 0.3 * $1000 = $300\nAccommodation: 0.15 * $1000 = $150\nEntertainment: 0.25 * $1000 = $250\n3. Subtract the total amount he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment from his budget to find how much he spends on coursework materials:\nCoursework materials: $1000 - ($300 + $150 + $250) = $1000 - $700 = $300\nI hope it is correct: $300",
        "ground_truth": "Accommodation is 15% * $1000=$<<15*.01*1000=150>>150\nFood is          30% * $1000=$<<30*.01*1000=300>>300\nEntertainment is   25% * $1000=$<<25*.01*1000=250>>250\nCoursework materials are thus $1000-($150+$300+$250) = $300\n#### 300"
