At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a race, there are eight runners. The first five runners finish the race in 8 hours, while the rest of the runners finish the race 2 hours later. Calculate the total time the eight runners took to finish the race.",

The remaining three runners took 10 hours to finish the race (8 hours + 2 hours), so the total time for them is 3 * 10 = 30 hours.\n3. To find the total time for all eight runners, we add the time for the first five runners and the time for the remaining three runners: 40 hours + 30 hours = 70 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: 70 hours",
