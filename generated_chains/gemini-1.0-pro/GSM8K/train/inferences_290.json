They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?",

Each boy got 1 egg more than each girl, so each girl got (8 / 7) - 1 = 1/7 eggs.\n6. 7 girls got 1 * 7 = 7 eggs.\n7. The boys got 8 eggs.\n8. 8 - 7 = 1 boy got an extra egg; 8 / 1 = 8 boys.\nI hope it is correct: 8",
