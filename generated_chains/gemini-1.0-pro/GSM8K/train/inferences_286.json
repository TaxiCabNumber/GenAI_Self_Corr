At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere were 18 students assigned in a minibus for a field trip. Eight of these students were boys. On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same since some of the girls were not able to join the trip. How many girls were not able to join the field trip?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet the number of girls who were able to join the trip be x.\nAccording to the given information, we can write the equation:\nx + 8 = 18 - x\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2x = 10\nDividing both sides by 2, we find:\nx = 5\nTherefore, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is:\n18 - 5 - 8 = 5\n**I hope it is correct: 5**",
        "ground_truth": "8 boys + 8 girls = <<8+8=16>>16 students joined the field trip.\nThus, 18 - 16 = <<18-16=2>>2 girls were not able to join the field trip.\n#### 2"
