        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCary is an engineer in charge of designing an irrigation system for three farmers. Farmer Bob grows 3 acres of corn, 9 acres of cotton, and 12 acres of beans. Farmer Brenda grows 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of cotton, and 14 acres of beans. Farmer Bernie grows 2 acres of corn and 12 acres of cotton. If corn takes 20 gallons of water an acre, cotton takes 80 gallons of water an acre, and beans take twice as much water as corn, what percentage of the total water used will go to Farmer Bob's farm?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total acreage of each farmer.\nBob: 3 + 9 + 12 = 24 acres\nBrenda: 6 + 7 + 14 = 27 acres\nBernie: 2 + 12 = 14 acres\n\n2. Multiply the acreage of each crop by the water usage per acre.\nCorn: 20 gallons/acre\nCotton: 80 gallons/acre\nBeans: 40 gallons/acre (twice as much as corn)\n\nTotal water usage for each farmer:\nBob: (3 * 20) + (9 * 80) + (12 * 40) = 1,120 gallons\nBrenda: (6 * 20) + (7 * 80) + (14 * 40) = 1,260 gallons\nBernie: (2 * 20) + (12 * 80) = 960 gallons\n\n3. Find the total water usage by adding the water usage for each farmer.\nTotal water usage: 1,120 + 1,260 + 960 = 3,340 gallons\n\n4. Calculate the percentage of water going to Farmer Bob's farm.\nPercentage used by Bob: (1,120 / 3,340) * 100% = **33.53%**\n\nI hope it is correct: 33.53%",
