At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?",
        "inference": "The hare runs 10 feet/second and the turtle runs 1 foot/second. So, the hare runs 10 times as fast as the turtle.\n\nIf the turtle gets a head start of x seconds, then the hare will need to run for (20 - x) seconds to finish the race.\n\nSince the hare runs 10 times as fast as the turtle, it will cover the same distance in 1/10th of the time.\n\nSo, the hare will need to run for (20 - x) / 10 seconds to finish the race.\n\nIn order for the hare and the turtle to finish in a tie, the hare must run for the same amount of time as the turtle.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n(20 - x) / 10 = x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the turtle needs a head start of 10 seconds in order to finish the race in a tie.\nI hope it is correct: 10",
        "ground_truth": "We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet/second = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds\nWe can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot/second = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds\nFinally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds\n#### 18"
