They planned to share the doughnuts evenly with their 8 other friends. How many doughnuts will each of them receive?",

Combine the total number of doughnuts: 24 + 36 = 60 doughnuts. \n\n3. Divide the total number of doughnuts by the number of people sharing: 60 doughnuts / 10 people = 6 doughnuts per person.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 6",
