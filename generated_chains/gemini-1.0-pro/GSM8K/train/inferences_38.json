At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n- We need to determine the amount of tea used for a 12-ounce cup of tea at the ratio of 1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of tea.\n- The ratio of 1 ounce to 8 ounces is equivalent to the ratio of x ounces to 12 ounces (where x represents the amount of tea needed for 12 ounces of tea).\n- To solve for x, we can set up a proportion: 1/8 = x/12. Cross-multiplying, we get 12 = 8x. Dividing both sides by 8, we find x = 3/2.\n- Since each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, we multiply the amount of tea needed for 12 ounces (x = 3/2) by the number of people (12) to get the total amount of tea needed: 12 * 3/2 = 18 ounces.\n- **I hope it is correct: 18 ounces**",
        "ground_truth": "She is making 72 ounces of water because 12 x 6 = <<12*6=72>>72\nShe needs 9 ounces of tea because 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9\n#### 9"
