        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony has a terrible toothache and decides to buy some painkillers from the store.  He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home.  He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days.  On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better.  How many pills are left in the bottle?",
        "inference": "1. First, determine the number of pills Tony takes each day. He takes 2 pills three times a day, so he takes a total of 6 pills each day for the first 2 days: 6 pills/day x 2 days = 12 pills.\n2. Next, determine the number of pills Tony takes each day for the next 3 days. He cuts his dosage in half, so he takes 3 pills each day for the next 3 days: 3 pills/day x 3 days = 9 pills.\n3. Finally, determine the number of pills Tony takes on the sixth day. He takes 2 pills in the morning, so he takes a total of 2 pills on the sixth day.\n4. Add up the total number of pills Tony takes: 12 pills + 9 pills + 2 pills = 23 pills.\n5. Subtract the total number of pills Tony takes from the original number of pills in the bottle: 50 pills - 23 pills = 27 pills left.\n\nI hope it is correct: 27",
        "ground_truth": "Tony starts with 50 pills and takes 2 pills each 3 times a day, meaning he takes 2*3=6 pills in total.\nTony repeats this process for two days in total, meaning over those two days he takes 2*6= <<2*6=12>>12 pills\nTony then cuts down his pill usage in half, meaning he's now taking 6/2= <<6/2=3>>3 pills a day.\nSince he repeats this process for three days, that means he takes 3*3= <<3*3=9>>9 pills for that period.\nAdding in the two pills Tony took on the final day, that means he took 12+9+2=<<12+9+2=23>>23 pills.\nSince there were 50 pills in the bottle to begin with, this means Tony has 50-23=<<50-23=27>>27 pills remaining.\n#### 27"
