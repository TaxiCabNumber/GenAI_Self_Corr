At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers and twice as many peppers than the cucumbers. How many vegetables did the garden produce?",
        "inference": "The garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers, and twice as many peppers than the cucumbers. So, the number of cucumbers is x, the number of potatoes is 237, and the number of peppers is 2x. We can find the total number of vegetables by adding the number of cucumbers, potatoes, and peppers produced.\nTotal vegetables = cucumbers + potatoes + peppers\nSubstituting x for cucumbers and 2x for peppers, we get:\nTotal vegetables = x + 237 + 2x\nCombining like terms, we get:\nTotal vegetables = 3x + 237\nTo find the total number of vegetables, we need to know the value of x, the number of cucumbers. The problem states that the number of cucumbers is 60 fewer than the number of potatoes. So, we can substitute 237 - 60 for x in the equation:\nTotal vegetables = 3(237 - 60) + 237\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\nTotal vegetables = 3(177) + 237\nMultiplying, we get:\nTotal vegetables = 531 + 237\nAdding, we get:\nTotal vegetables = 768\nI hope it is correct: 768",
        "ground_truth": "The garden produced 237 potatoes - 60 = <<237-60=177>>177 cucumbers.\nThe garden produced 177 cucumbers * 2 peppers/cucumber = <<177*2=354>>354 peppers.\nThe garden produced 237 potatoes + 177 cucumbers + 354 peppers = <<237+177+354=768>>768 vegetables.\n#### 768"
