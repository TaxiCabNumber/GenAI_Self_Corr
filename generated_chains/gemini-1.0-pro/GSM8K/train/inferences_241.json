At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Lu owns a computer store. For last month, half of their sales are laptops, one-third are netbooks, and the rest are desktop computers. If Mr. Lu's store was able to sell a total of 72 computers, how many of them are desktop computers?",
        "inference": "1. Half of 72 is 36, so 36 computers are laptops.\n2. One-third of 72 is 24, so 24 computers are netbooks.\n3. 72 - 36 - 24 = 12, so 12 computers are desktop computers.\nI hope it is correct: $12$",
        "ground_truth": "There were 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 laptops sold.\nThere were 72/3 = <<72/3=24>>24 netbooks sold.\nSo, there were a total of 36 + 24 = <<36+24=60>>60 laptops and netbooks sold.\nThus, 72 - 60 = <<72-60=12>>12 desktop computers were sold last month.\n#### 12"
