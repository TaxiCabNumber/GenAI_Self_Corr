At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?",
