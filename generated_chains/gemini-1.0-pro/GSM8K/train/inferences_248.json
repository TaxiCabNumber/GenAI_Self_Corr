At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn 18-month magazine subscription is normally $34. The magazine is currently running a promotion for $0.25 off each twice-a-month issue when signing up for the 18-month subscription. How many dollars cheaper is the promotional subscription than the normal one?",

        "ground_truth": "The subscription sends twice monthly issues, so there are 2 * 18 = <<2*18=36>>36 issues.\nThus, the promotional offer is 36 * 0.25 = $<<36*0.25=9>>9 cheaper than the normal subscription.\n#### 9"
