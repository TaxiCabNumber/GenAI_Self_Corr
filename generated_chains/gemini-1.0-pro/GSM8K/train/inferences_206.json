At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are some lions in Londolozi at first. Lion cubs are born at the rate of 5 per month and lions die at the rate of 1 per month. If there are 148 lions in Londolozi after 1 year, how many lions were there in Londolozi at first?",
        "inference": "First, let me find the total number of lions born in 1 year. There are 12 months in a year and since the birth rate of lion cubs is 5 per month, so the total number of lion cubs born in a year is 5 \u00d7 12 = 60\n\nNow, I need to find the total number of lions that died in 1 year. Since the death rate of lions is 1 per month, so the total number of lions that died in a year is 1 \u00d7 12 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the total number of new lions (cubs born - lions died) in a year is \n60 - 12 = 48\n\nFinally, I can find the number of lions that were there in Londolozi at first by subtracting the total number of new lions in a year from the total number of lions in Londolozi after 1 year: \n148 - 48 = 100\n\nI hope it is correct: 100",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5-1=<<5-1=4>>4 more lions each month.\nThere will be 4*12=<<4*12=48>>48 more lions after 1 year.\nThere were 148-48=<<148-48=100>>100 lions in Londolozi at first.\n#### 100"
