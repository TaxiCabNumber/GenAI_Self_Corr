At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?",

So 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 packages of raspberries\nThe raspberries cost $5.00 per package and she needs 2 so 5*2 = $<<5*2=10.00>>10.00\nEvery quart needs 2 cups of heavy cream and she's making 2 quarts so 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 quarts\nShe will spend $6.00 on strawberries, $10.00 on raspberries and $4.00 on heavy cream bringing the total to 6+10+4 = $<<6+10+4=20.00>>20.00\n#### 20"
