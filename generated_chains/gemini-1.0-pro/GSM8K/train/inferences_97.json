At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nNancy shelved 12 + 8 + 4 = 24 books from the top section of the cart.\n\nHalf of the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, so she put back 1/2 x (24 books) = 12 mystery books.\n\nShe then shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, which included 5 Western novels and 6 biographies, so she shelved a total of 5 + 6 = 11 books from the bottom of the cart.\n\nTherefore, she had a total of 24 + 12 + 11 = 47 books on the book cart when she started.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 47 $books$**",
        "ground_truth": "Half of the books on the bottom section of the cart are mystery books, which means they are the same as the number of Western novels and biographies put together. So there are 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11 mystery novels.\nAdd them all together, and there are 12 history + 8 romance + 4 poetry + 11 mystery + 5 Western + 6 biographies = <<12+8+4+11+5+6=46>>46 books total\n#### 46"
