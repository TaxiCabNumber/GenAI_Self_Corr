At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUrsula is working at a marketing firm. She created a 30-second long commercial. Her boss told her that this commercial is too long to air and told her to shorten the commercial by 30%. How long will this commercial be after Ursula makes the desired changes?",
        "inference": "- The commercial's original length is 30 seconds.\n- Ursula needs to shorten the commercial by 30%.\n- To find the new length of the commercial, we need to multiply the original length by 1 minus the percentage of reduction.\n- So, new length = original length \u00d7 (1 - percentage of reduction)\n- New length = 30 seconds \u00d7 (1 - 30%)\n- New length = 30 seconds \u00d7 0.7\n- New length = 21 seconds\nI hope it is correct: 21 seconds",
        "ground_truth": "Ursula's boss want's the commercial to be 30/100 * 30 = <<30/100*30=9>>9 seconds shorter.\nAfter Ursula makes the desired changes, the ad is going to be 30 - 9 = <<30-9=21>>21 seconds long.\n#### 21"
