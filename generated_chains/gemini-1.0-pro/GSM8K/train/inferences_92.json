They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?",

Determine the amount of money Bob will earn in a year: $4 per day x 365 days = $1,460\n3. Calculate the total amount of money they will earn in a year: $2,190 + $1,460 = $3,650\n4.
