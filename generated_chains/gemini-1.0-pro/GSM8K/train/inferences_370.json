        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNurse Missy is attending to the needs of 12 patients in her hospital ward.  Most of her patients require standard care, but one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements, which increases the serving time by 20%.  At dinner time, she brings each patient their meal. It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.  How long does it take, in minutes, for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements:\n12 x 1/3 = 4 patients\n\n2. Calculate the increased serving time for patients with special dietary requirements:\n5 minutes + (20% of 5 minutes) = 6 minutes\n\n3. Calculate the total time to serve all patients:\n4 patients x 6 minutes per patient + 8 patients x 5 minutes per patient = 24 minutes + 40 minutes = 64 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 64",
        "ground_truth": "Nurse Missy has 12*(1/3)=<<12*(1/3)=4>>4 special needs patients.\nShe has 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 standard care patients.\nSpecial needs patients take 20% longer to serve, which means serving takes 1.2*5=6 minutes per patient.\nTo serve dinner to all of her standard care patients, it will take 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 minutes.\nTo serve dinner to all of her special needs patients, it will take 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 minutes.\nIn total, it will take 40+24=<<40+24=64>>64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.\n#### 64"
