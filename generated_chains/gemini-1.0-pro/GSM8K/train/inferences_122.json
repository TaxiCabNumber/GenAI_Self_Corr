At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a conference room, 40 chairs with a capacity of 2 people each were arranged in rows in preparation for the board meeting of a company, whose number of members was the same as the chairs' capacity. If 2/5 of the chairs were not occupied, and the rest each had two people, calculate the number of board members who did attend the meeting.",
