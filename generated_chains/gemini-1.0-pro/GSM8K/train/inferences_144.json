At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe owner of a Turkish restaurant wanted to prepare traditional dishes for an upcoming celebration. She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?",
        "inference": "1. Since each package contained 4 pounds of meat, the total weight delivered by the first two butchers was 10 x 4 + 7 x 4 = 68 pounds\n2. To find the weight delivered by the third butcher, we need to subtract the weight delivered by the first two butchers from the total weight of 100 pounds.\n3. Therefore, the weight delivered by the third butcher was 100 - 68 = 32 pounds.\n4. Since each package contained 4 pounds of meat, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher was 32 / 4 = 8 packages.\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 packages",
        "ground_truth": "Since each package weighed 4 pounds, the first butcher delivered 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 pounds\nThe second butcher's delivery was 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 pounds\nThe first two butchers therefore delivered 40 + 28 = <<40+28=68>>68 pounds\nSubtracting that weight from the total weight of ground beef gives 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds\nIt therefore means the third butcher delivered 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.\n#### 8"
