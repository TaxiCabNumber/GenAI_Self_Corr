At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere is very little car traffic on Happy Street. During the week, most cars pass it on Tuesday - 25. On Monday, 20% less than on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, 2 more cars than on Monday. On Thursday and Friday, it is about 10 cars each day. On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day. How many cars travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday?",
