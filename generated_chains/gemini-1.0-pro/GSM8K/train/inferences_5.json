At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?",
        "inference": "- Mark has 10 yellow flowers.\n- There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. So, there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers.\n\n- There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers together. So, there are (10 + 18) * 0.25 = 7 green flowers.\n\n- Therefore, Mark has a total of 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden.\n\nI hope it is correct: #### 35",
