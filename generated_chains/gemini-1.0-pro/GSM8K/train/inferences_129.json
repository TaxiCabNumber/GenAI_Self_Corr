At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDan owns an ice cream shop and every sixth customer gets a free ice cream cone. Cones cost $2 each. If he sold $100 worth of cones, how many free ones did he give away?",
        "inference": "1. Divide the total amount of money Dan earned by the price of each cone to find the number of cones he sold: $100 / $2 = 50 cones\n2. Determine the fraction of customers who received free cones: 1/6\n3. Multiply the number of cones sold by the fraction of customers who received free cones to find the number of free cones: 50 cones * 1/6 = 8.33 free cones\nI hope it is correct: 8.33 free cones",
        "ground_truth": "He sold 50 cones because 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50\nHe gave away 10 cones because 50 / 5 = <<50/5=10>>10\n#### 10"
