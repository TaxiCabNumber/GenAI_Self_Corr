At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlyssa, Keely, and Kendall ordered 100 chicken nuggets from a fast-food restaurant. Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa. How many did Alyssa eat?",
        "inference": "1. Let x be the number of nuggets Alyssa ate.\n2. Keely and Kendall each ate 2x nuggets.\n3. Together, they ate a total of x + 2x + 2x = 5x nuggets.\n4. Since they ordered 100 nuggets, we have 5x = 100.\n5. Solving for x, we get x = 20.\nI hope it is correct: Alyssa ate 20 nuggets.",
        "ground_truth": "To figure out this problem we need to turn it into an equation. Let\u2019s make A the number of nuggets Alyssa ate. We know all three girls ate 100 nuggets total, so 100 nuggets = A (how many Alyssa ate) + 2A (how many Keely ate) + 3A (how many Kendall ate) or 100 = A + 2A + 3A which is 100 = 5A\nThen we will divide each side by 5 to figure out how many nuggets Alyssa ate, 100/5 = 5A/5 or 20 = A.\n#### 20"
