        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFive friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the order:\n\nHamburger: 5 x $3 = $15\nFrench fries: 4 x $1.20 = $4.80\nSoda: 5 x $0.5 = $2.50\nSpaghetti: 1 x $2.7 = $2.70\n\nTotal cost: $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.70 = $25.00\n\n2. Divide the total cost by the number of people:\n\n$25.00 \u00f7 5 = $5.00\n\nEach person will pay $5.00.\n\n**I hope it is correct: $5.00$**",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of 5 pieces of hamburger is $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nThe cost of 4 sets of French fries is $1.20 x 4 = $<<1.20*4=4.80>>4.80.\nThe cost of 5 cups of soda is $0.5 x 5 = $<<0.5*5=2.50>>2.50.\nSo their total bill is $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 +$2.7 = $<<15+4.8+2.5+2.7=25>>25.\nHence, each of the five friends will contribute $25/5 = $<<25/5=5>>5.\n#### 5"
