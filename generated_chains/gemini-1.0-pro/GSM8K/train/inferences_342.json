So he was on the sideline for some time after playing 35 minutes.\n3. The total time he was on the sideline is the sum of the time he was on the sideline after playing 20 minutes and the time he was on the sideline after playing 35 minutes.\n4. Since the game was 90 minutes long, the time he was on the sideline is 90 minutes minus the time he played (which is 20 minutes plus 35 minutes).\n5. So, the time he was on the sideline is 90 minutes - 55 minutes = 35 minutes.\nI hope it is correct: 35 minutes",
