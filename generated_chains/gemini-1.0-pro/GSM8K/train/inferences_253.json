At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA rectangular plot of private property is fenced in by a chain-link fence. The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let the length of the short sides be x feet.\n\n**Step 2:** Then the length of the long sides is 3x feet.\n\n**Step 3:** The total length of the fence is 2(x + 3x) = 8x feet.\n\n**Step 4:** 8x = 640\n\n**Step 5:** x = 80\n\n**Step 6:** The length of the short side that needs to be replaced is x = 80 feet.\n\nI hope it is correct: 80",
        "ground_truth": "Let S be the length of the short side of the fence.\nThus, the length of a long side of the fence is 3S.\nThere are 2 of each side, so the whole fence is 2S + 2 * 3S = 2S + 6S = 8S long.\nThe whole fence is 8S = 640 feet long.\nThus, the short side of the fence that needs to be replaced is S = 640 / 8 = <<640/8=80>>80 feet long.\n#### 80"
