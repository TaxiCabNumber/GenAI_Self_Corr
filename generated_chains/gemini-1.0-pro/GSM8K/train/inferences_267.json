        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJimmy is going to sell pizzas at the carnival to make some money. The carnival only gave him 7 hours to do so. He bought a 22kg sack of flour to make his pizzas and he takes 10 min to make each pizza for the customers. At the end of the 7 hours, he saw some flour was left. Knowing that each pizza needs 0.5kg of flour to make, how many pizzas can he make to bring home with the flour left?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 7 hours to minutes: 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes\n2. Calculate the total amount of flour used to make pizzas: 22kg * 1000g/kg = 22000g\n3. Calculate the number of pizzas that can be made with 22kg of flour: 22000g / 500g/pizza = 44 pizzas\n4. Calculate the total amount of time spent making the pizzas: 44 pizzas * 10 minutes/pizza = 440 minutes\n5. Calculate the time left after making the pizzas: 420 minutes - 440 minutes = -20 minutes\n6. Since Jimmy cannot make pizzas in negative time, he has 20 minutes left.\n7. Calculate the amount of flour left after making the pizzas: -20 minutes * 10g/minute = -200g\n8. Calculate the number of pizzas that can be made with the remaining flour: -200g / 500g/pizza = -0.4 pizzas\n9. Since Jimmy cannot make a negative number of pizzas, he cannot make any more pizzas with the remaining flour.\nI hope it is correct: 0 $pizzas$",
        "ground_truth": "Each hour Jimmy makes 60min \u00f7 10min/pizza = <<60/10=6>>6 Pizzas\nThe number of total pizzas made equals 7 hours x 6 pizzas/hour = <<7*6=42>>42 pizzas\nThe amount of total flour used equals 42 pizzas x 0.5 kg/pizza = <<42*0.5=21>>21 kg\nThe amount of flour left equals 22 kg - 21 kg = <<22-21=1>>1 kg\nThe number of pizzas Jimmy can make is 1kg \u00f7 0.5kg/pizza = <<1/0.5=2>>2 pizzas\n#### 2"
