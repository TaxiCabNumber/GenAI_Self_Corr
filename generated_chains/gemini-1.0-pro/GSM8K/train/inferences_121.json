At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStella and Twinkle are filling up a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks at the rate of 250 blocks per hour per person. They work for four hours and are then joined by 6 other people who also work at the same rate. How many hours did filling the truck take?",
        "inference": "1. Stella and Twinkle filled 250 x 4 x 2 = 2000 blocks in 4 hours.\n2. The remaining blocks to be filled = 6000 - 2000 = 4000 blocks.\n3. Now, 8 people are working, so the rate of filling = 250 x 8 = 2000 blocks per hour.\n4. Therefore, the time taken to fill the remaining 4000 blocks = 4000/2000 = 2 hours.\n5.
