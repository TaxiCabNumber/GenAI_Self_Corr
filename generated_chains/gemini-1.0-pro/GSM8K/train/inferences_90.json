At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHerman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?",
        "inference": "1. January has 31 days.  He will need 31 * 2 * 1/2 = 31 cups for January.\n2. February normally has 28 or 29 days.  Since it doesn't say in this problem, we will take the average which is (28 + 29) / 2 = 28.5.  He will need 28.5 * 2 * 1/2 = 28.5 cups for February.\n3. December has 31 days.  He will need 31 * 2 * 1/2 = 31 cups for December.\n4. Total cups needed for all three months is 31 + 28.5 + 31 = 90.5 cups.\nI hope it is correct: 90.5",
        "ground_truth": "December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days for a total of 31+31+28 = <<31+31+28=90>>90 days\nHe feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon for a total of 1/2+1/2 = <<1/2+1/2=1>>1 cup per day\nIf he feeds them 1 cup per day for 90 days then he will need 1*90 = <<1*90=90>>90 cups of birdseed\n#### 90"
