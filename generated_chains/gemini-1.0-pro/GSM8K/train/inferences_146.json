At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRichard can clean his room in 22 minutes. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard to clean her room while Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory. If they have to clean their rooms twice a week, how many minutes do all three spend cleaning their rooms each week?",
        "inference": "1. Richard takes 22 minutes to clean his room.\n2. Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard, so Cory takes 22 + 3 = 25 minutes to clean her room.\n3. Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory, so Blake takes 25 - 4 = 21 minutes to clean his room.\n4. If they have to clean their rooms twice a week, then:\n   - Richard spends 22 x 2 = 44 minutes cleaning his room each week.\n   - Cory spends 25 x 2 = 50 minutes cleaning her room each week.\n   - Blake spends 21 x 2 = 42 minutes cleaning his room each week.\n5. Therefore, all three of them spend 44 + 50 + 42 = 136 minutes cleaning their rooms each week.\nI hope it is correct: 136",
