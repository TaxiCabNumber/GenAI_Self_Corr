At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA library cabinet houses five ancient scrolls. The first scroll is 4080 years old. If each scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll\u2019s age, how old is the fifth scroll?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the age of the second scroll**\n\nThe second scroll is older than the first by half as many years as the first scroll\u2019s age. So, the second scroll is 4080 + (4080 / 2) = 6120 years old.\n\n**Step 2: Find the age of the third scroll**\n\nThe third scroll is older than the second by half as many years as the second scroll\u2019s age. So, the third scroll is 6120 + (6120 / 2) = 9180 years old.\n\n**Step 3: Find the age of the fourth scroll**\n\nThe fourth scroll is older than the third by half as many years as the third scroll\u2019s age. So, the fourth scroll is 9180 + (9180 / 2) = 13770 years old.\n\n**Step 4: Find the age of the fifth scroll**\n\nThe fifth scroll is older than the fourth by half as many years as the fourth scroll\u2019s age. So, the fifth scroll is 13770 + (13770 / 2) = 20655 years old.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 20655**",
