So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for $26 each; 2 necklaces for $83 each; and 1 computer game for $90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a $12 rebate. What is the total cost of the gifts after the rebate?",

Add the cost of the polo shirts and the necklaces: $78 + $166 = $244\n4. Add the cost of the computer game: $244 + $90 = $334\n5. Subtract the rebate from the total cost: $334 - $12 = $322\nI hope it is correct: $322$",
