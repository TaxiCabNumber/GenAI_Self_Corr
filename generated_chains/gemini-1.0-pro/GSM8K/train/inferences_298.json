So, Jack took a total of x/2 + 4 candies.\nAfter Jack took his candies, there were x/2 - 4 candies left.\nPaul took the remaining 7 candies. So, there were a total of x/2 - 4 - 7 = x/2 - 11 candies left after both Jack and Paul took their candies.\nSince there were no candies left on the table, we have:\nx/2 - 11 = 0\nSolving for x, we get:\nx/2 = 11\nx = 11 * 2\nx = 22\nI hope it is correct: 22",
