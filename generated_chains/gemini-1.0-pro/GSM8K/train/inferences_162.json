At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDaniel has a collection of 346 video games. 80 of them, Daniel bought for $12 each. Of the rest, 50% were bought for $7. All others had a price of $3 each. How much did Daniel spend on all the games in his collection?",
        "inference": "- Daniel bought 80 games for $12 each, so he spent 80 * $12 = $960 on those games.\n- 50% of the remaining games were bought for $7 each. Since there are 346 - 80 = 266 games in total, 50% of the remaining games is 266/2 = 133 games. So Daniel spent 133 * $7 = $931 on those games.\n- The rest of the games were bought for $3 each. There are 346 - 80 - 133 = 133 games in this category. So Daniel spent 133 * $3 = $399 on those games.\n- Adding up the amounts Daniel spent on each category of games, we get 960 + 931 + 399 = $2,290.\n\nI hope it is correct: $2290",
