At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?",
        "inference": "Tina's hourly wage is $18.00. She works 10 hours every day. So, she works 10 hours * 5 days = 50 hours each week. She is eligible for overtime for hours worked over 8 hours per shift. So, she is eligible for overtime for 50 hours - 8 hours * 5 days = 20 hours each week. Her overtime pay is $18.00 + $18.00 / 2 = $27.00 per hour. So, she makes $27.00 * 20 hours = $540.00 each week in overtime pay. Her total pay each week is $18.00 * 40 hours + $540.00 = $900.00.\nI hope it is correct: $900.00",
