At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJack is running a bake sale to help pay for his basketball team's uniforms. He's already sold 4 brownies for $3 each and 5 lemon squares for $2 each. If Jack's goal is to make $50 and he sells cookies for $4 each, how many cookies does he need to sell to reach his goal?",
        "inference": "Jack has already made $4 * 3 + $5 * 2 = $12 + $10 = $22 from the brownies and lemon squares. So, he needs to make $50 - $22 = $28 from cookies. Since each cookie is $4, he needs to sell $28 / $4 = 7 cookies.\nI hope it is correct: 7 cookies",
        "ground_truth": "Jack earned from the brownies $3 per brownie * 4 brownies = $<<3*4=12>>12.\nJack earned from the lemon squares $2 per square * 5 squares = $<<2*5=10>>10.\nHe still needs to earn $50 - $12 - $10 = $<<50-12-10=28>>28.\nHe sells cookies for $4 each, so Jack still needs to sell $28 / $4 = <<28/4=7>>7 cookies.\n#### 7"
