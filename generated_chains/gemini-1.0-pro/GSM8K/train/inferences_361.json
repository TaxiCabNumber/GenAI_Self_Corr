        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?",
        "inference": "1. The distance covered on the first day is 20 hours * 30 kilometers per hour = 600 kilometers.\n2. Since the ship is only one-third of the way to its destination, the total distance to the destination is 600 kilometers * 3 = 1800 kilometers. \n3. Therefore, the ship has been blown backward by the storm by 1800 kilometers - 600 kilometers = 1200 kilometers.\nI hope it is correct: 1200",
        "ground_truth": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers.\n#### 200"
