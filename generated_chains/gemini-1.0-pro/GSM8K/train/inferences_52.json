At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArnel had ten boxes of pencils with the same number of pencils in each box.  He kept ten pencils and shared the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. If his friends got eight pencils each, how many pencils are in each box?",
        "inference": "Arnel had ten boxes of pencils and kept ten pencils.  So, there are 10 * x - 10 pencils remaining.  He shared these pencils equally among his five friends, who each got eight pencils.  So, we can write the equation: 10 * x - 10 = 5 * 8.  \n\nWe can solve for x by first multiplying both sides of the equation by 1/10: x - 1 = 4.  Then, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation: x = 5.  \nI hope it is correct: 5",
        "ground_truth": "Arnel shared 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 pencils with his friends.\nSo, he had 10 + 40 = <<10+40=50>>50 pencils in all.\nTherefore, each box had 50/10 = <<50/10=5>>5 pencils inside.\n#### 5"
