At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?",
        "inference": "\u2022 The first tank hold 48 gallons of water, the second tank has half that amount which is 24 gallons.\n\u2022 With the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, the first tank will hold 48 inches of fish and the second tank will hold 24 inches of fish.\n\u2022 48 inches of fish will hold 16 three-inch fish and the second tank will hold 12 two-inch fish.\n\u2022 If one three-inch fish is eaten, there will be 15 three-inch fish in the first tank and 12 two-inch fish in the second tank.\n\u2022 There will be 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank.\nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "The second tank is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 gallons.\nFollowing her rule, Gail keeps 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 two-inch fish in the second tank.\nShe keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 fish in the first tank.\nIf one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 16 - 1 = <<16-1=15>>15 fish in the first tank.\nThus, Gail would have 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 more fish in the first tank.\n#### 3"
