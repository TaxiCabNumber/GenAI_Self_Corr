At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKeaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times while working at the construction site. Reece, also working at the same site, climbed a ladder 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder 15 times. What's the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed in inches?",
        "inference": "1. Keaton climbed a 30 feet ladder twenty times which means he covered a distance of (30 x 20) = 600 feet.\n2. Reece's ladder was 4 feet shorter than 30 feet which means his ladder was (30 - 4) = 26 feet.\n3. Reece climbed the ladder 15 times which means he covered a distance of (26 x 15) = 390 feet.\n4. The total distance covered by both workers = (600 + 390) = 990 feet.\n5. There are 12 inches in 1 foot which means the total distance climbed by both workers in inches = (990 x 12) = 11880 inches.\nI hope it is correct: $11880$",
        "ground_truth": "If Keaton climbed his ladder twenty times, he covered a length of 30*20 = <<30*20=600>>600 feet.\nReece's ladder, 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder, was 30-4 = <<30-4=26>>26 feet long.\nIf Reece climbed the ladder 15 times, he covered a length of 15*26 = <<15*26=390>>390 feet.\nKeaton and Reece's total length covered while climbing the ladders is 390+600 = <<390+600=990>>990 feet.\nSince one foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length they climbed the ladders in inches is 12*990 = <<12*990=11880>>11880 inches.\n#### 11880"
