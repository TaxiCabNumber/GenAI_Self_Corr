At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast year Jessica paid $1000 for rent, $200 for food, and $100 for car insurance each month. This year her rent goes up by 30%, food costs increase by 50%, and the cost of her car insurance triples because she was at fault in an accident. How much more does Jessica pay for her expenses over the whole year compared to last year?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate Jessica's total expenses last year:\n- $1000 (rent) + $200 (food) + $100 (car insurance) = $1300\n\n2. Calculate the percentage increase in her expenses this year:\n- Rent: 30% increase\n- Food: 50% increase\n- Car insurance: triples (300% increase)\n\n3. Calculate the new monthly expenses for this year:\n- Rent: $1000 + (30% of $1000) = $1300\n- Food: $200 + (50% of $200) = $300\n- Car insurance: $100 * 3 = $300\n\n4. Calculate the new total expenses for this year:\n- $1300 (rent) + $300 (food) + $300 (car insurance) = $1900\n\n5. Calculate the difference in expenses between this year and last year:\n- $1900 (this year) - $1300 (last year) = $600\n\nI hope it is correct: $600",
