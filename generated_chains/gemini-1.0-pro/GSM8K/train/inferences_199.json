At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGary bought his first used car for $6,000.  Gary borrowed the money from his dad who said he could pay him back the full amount over 5 years.  Gary decided he would pay his dad back the full amount in 2 years.  How much more is Gary spending per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5?",

To do this, we divide the total amount borrowed ($6,000) by the number of months in 5 years (60 months). This gives us a monthly payment of $100. \n\nNext, we need to find out how much Gary pays per month when he pays back the loan over 2 years. To do this, we divide the total amount borrowed ($6,000) by the number of months in 2 years (24 months). This gives us a monthly payment of $250. \n\nFinally, we need to find out how much more Gary is spending per month when he pays back the loan over 2 years instead of 5.
