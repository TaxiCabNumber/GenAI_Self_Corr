At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA roadwork company is paving a newly constructed 16-mile road. They use a mixture of pitch and gravel to make the asphalt to pave the road. Each truckloads of asphalt uses two bags of gravel and five times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch to make. It takes three truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. The company paved 4 miles of road on one day, then one mile less than double that on the second day. How many barrels of pitch will the company need to finish the remaining road on the third day?",
        "inference": "**Step 1.**  Since 3 truckloads of asphalt are needed to pave each mile of road, 12 truckloads are needed to pave 4 miles.\n\n**Step 2.**  The company paved one mile less than double that, or 7 miles, on the second day.  So, they have paved a total of 11 miles of the 16-mile project.\n\n**Step 3.**  Each truckload of asphalt requires five times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch.  So, if there are \\(x\\) barrels of pitch, there are 5\\(x\\) bags of gravel.\n\n**Step 4.**  Since each truckload of asphalt requires two bags of gravel, it requires 2/5 as many barrels of pitch.\n\n**Step 5.**  So, each truckload of asphalt requires (2/5)\\(x\\) barrels of pitch.\n\n**Step 6.**  Twelve truckloads of asphalt are needed to pave four miles, so four truckloads of asphalt are required to pave one mile.\n\n**Step 7.**  So, for the 11 miles they have already paved, they have used 44 truckloads of asphalt, which required 44(2/5)\\(x\\) barrels of pitch.\n\n**Step 8.**  They still have 5 miles to pave, which will require 20 truckloads of asphalt.  This will require 20(2/5)\\(x\\) additional barrels of pitch.\n\n**Step 9.**  So, the total number of barrels of pitch required for the entire project is 44(2/5)\\(x\\) + 20(2/5)\\(x\\), or 128/5\\(x\\).\n\n**Step 10.**  To finish the remaining road on the third day, they will need \\(x\\)-\\(\\frac{128}{5}x=\\frac{3}{5}x\\) barrels of pitch.  \n\n**I hope it is correct: $$ \\frac{3}{5}x $$**",
        "ground_truth": "On the second day, the company paved 4 * 2 - 1 = <<4*2-1=7>>7 miles.\nThe company has 16 - 7 - 4 = <<16-7-4=5>>5 miles of road remaining to pave.\nThey will need 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 truckloads of asphalt to pave 5 miles of road.\nFor 15 truckloads, they will need 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 bags of gravel.\nThus, the company will need 30 / 5 = <<30/5=6>>6 barrels of pitch to finish the road on the third day.\n#### 6"
