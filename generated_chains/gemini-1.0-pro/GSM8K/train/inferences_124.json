At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoy is winding balls of yarn for her cat to play with. The first ball is half the size of the second ball. The third ball is three times as large as the first ball. She used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. How many feet of yarn did she use for the second ball?",

We know that:\n\n- The first ball is half the size of the second ball (First ball = 0.5 * Second ball)\n- The third ball is three times as large as the first ball (Third ball = 3 * First ball)\n- Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball (Third ball = 27 feet)\n\nWe can use the last equation to solve for the first ball.\n\nThird ball = 27 feet\n3 * First ball = 27 feet\nFirst ball = 9 feet\n\nNow that we know the size of the first ball, we can use the first equation to solve for the second ball.\n\nFirst ball = 0.5 * Second ball\n9 feet = 0.5 * Second ball\nSecond ball = 18 feet\n\nI hope it is correct: 18",
        "ground_truth": "The first ball is a third of the size of the third ball, so it used 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 feet of yarn.\nThe second ball is twice the size of the first ball, so she used 9 * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 feet of yarn.\n#### 18"
