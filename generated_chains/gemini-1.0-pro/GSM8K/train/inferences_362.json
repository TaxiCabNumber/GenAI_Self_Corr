        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaren\u2019s work tote bag is twice the weight of her husband Kevin\u2019s briefcase when the briefcase is empty. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen\u2019s tote. Kevin\u2019s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase. If Karen\u2019s tote weighs 8 pounds, how many more pounds does Kevin\u2019s laptop weigh than Karen\u2019s tote?",
