At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more cows than goats.  If the farmer has 56 animals total, how many goats does he have?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of goats as \u2019x\u2019. \nThen, the number of cows would be \u2018x + 4\u2019 and the number of pigs would be \u20182(x + 4)\u2019 \n\nAccording to the question, the total number of animals is 56. So, we can write the equation: \n\nx + (x + 4) + 2(x + 4) = 56 \n\nSolving for x: \n\nx + x + 4 + 2x + 8 = 56 \n4x + 12 = 56 \n4x = 56 - 12 \n4x = 44\n x = 11 \n\nTherefore, the number of goats is 11.\n\nI hope it is correct: $11$",
