        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAngela is a bike messenger in New York. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?",
        "inference": "1. Let's think step-by-step.\n2. Let x be the number of meals Angela delivers.\n3. According to the problem, the number of packages is 8 times the number of meals, so the number of packages is 8x.\n4. The total number of meals and packages is 27, so we can write an equation:\nx + 8x = 27\n5. Simplifying the equation:\n9x = 27\n6. Solving for x:\nx = 3\n7. Therefore, Angela delivers 3 meals.\nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "Let p be the number of packages Angela delivers and m be the number of meals. We know that p + m = 27 and p = 8m.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 8m + m = 27\nCombining like terms, we get 9m = 27\nDividing both sides by 9, we get m = 3\n#### 3"
