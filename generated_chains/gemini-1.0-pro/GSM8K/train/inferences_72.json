At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- The aquarium has a volume of 4 * 6 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.\n- When Nancy fills the aquarium halfway, it has 36 cubic feet of water.\n- When the cat knocks the aquarium over, it spills half the water, leaving 18 cubic feet of water.\n- When Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium, she adds 18 * 3 = 54 cubic feet of water.\n- So, the aquarium now has 18 + 54 = 72 cubic feet of water.\n\nI hope it is correct: 72",
        "ground_truth": "First calculate the volume of the aquarium by multiplying its length, width and height: 4 ft * 6 ft * 3 ft = <<4*6*3=72>>72 cubic ft\nThen figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after the cat knocks it over: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\nThen figure out what proportion of the aquarium is full after Nancy refills it: 3 * 1/4 = 3/4\nNow multiply the proportion of the aquarium that's full by the aquarium's volume to find out how much water is in it: 72 cubic ft * 3/4 = <<72*3/4=54>>54 cubic ft\n#### 54"
