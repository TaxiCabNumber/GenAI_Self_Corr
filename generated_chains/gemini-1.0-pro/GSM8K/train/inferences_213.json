At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMike and Ted planted tomatoes.  In the morning, Mike planted 50 tomato seeds while Ted planted twice as much as Mike.  In the afternoon, Mike planted 60 tomato seeds while Ted planted 20 fewer tomato seeds than Mike. How many tomato seeds did they plant altogether?",

Ted planted twice as many seeds as Mike in the morning, so he planted 2*50 = 100 seeds in the morning. In the afternoon, he planted 20 fewer seeds than Mike, meaning he planted 60-20 = 40 seeds in the afternoon. This means he planted 100+40 = 140 seeds in total.\n\n3. Therefore, Mike and Ted planted 110+140 = 250 tomato seeds altogether.\n\nI hope it is correct: 250",
