At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find out how much salt is in the seawater. We know that the water is 20% salt, so 20% of 2 liters is the amount of salt. 20% of 2 liters is 0.4 liters. \n2. Now, we need to convert liters to milliliters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so 0.4 liters is 400 milliliters. I hope it is correct: 400",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many liters of the seawater are salt: 2 liters * 20% = <<2*20*.01=.4>>.4 liters\nThen multiply that amount by 1000 ml/liter to find the number of ml of salt Jack gets: .4 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<.4*1000=400>>400 ml\n#### 400"
