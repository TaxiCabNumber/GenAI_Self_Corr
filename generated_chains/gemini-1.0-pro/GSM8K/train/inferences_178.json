At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSimon wanted to buy flowers that his mom could plant for Mother's Day.  The garden center was offering 10% off all purchases.  He bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each.  If he paid with a $50 bill, how much change would Simon receive back from his purchase?",
        "inference": "**1. Calculate the total cost of the flowers:**\n5 pansies x $2.50 each = $12.50\n1 hydrangea = $12.50\n5 petunias x $1.00 each = $5.00\nTotal cost = $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $30.00\n\n**2. Calculate the 10% discount:**\nDiscount = 10% x $30.00 = $3.00\n\n**3. Calculate the total cost after the discount:**\nCost after discount = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00\n\n**4. Calculate the change from the $50 bill:**\nChange = $50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00\n\n**Answer:** Simon would receive back I hope it is correct: $23.00",
        "ground_truth": "5 pansies at $2.50 each is 5*2.50 = $<<5*2.5=12.50>>12.50\n5 petunias at $1.00 each 5*1 = $<<5*1=5.00>>5.00\nAll total he spends 12.50+12.50+5.00 = $<<12.50+12.50+5.00=30.00>>30.00\nThe sale is 10% off so 30*.10 = $<<30*.10=3.00>>3.00\nThe purchase total now comes to 30-3 = $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00\nHe pays with a $50 bill so 50-27 = $<<50-27=23.00>>23.00\n#### 23"
