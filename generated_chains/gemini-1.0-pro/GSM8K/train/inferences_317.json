She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. She works part-time 20 hours per week. How many hours left over does Madeline have?",

Convert 8 hours per day sleeping to hours per week: 8 hours/day * 7 days/week = 56 hours/week\n3. Add up all the hours spent in class, on homework, sleeping, and working: 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours/week\n4. Subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a week: 168 - 122 = 46 hours left over\n**I hope it is correct: 46 $hours left over$**",
        "ground_truth": "Madeline spends 4*7=<<4*7=28>>28 hours on homework.\nShe spends 8*7-56 hours sleeping.\nTherefore, she is busy 28+18+56+20=<<28+18+56+20=122>>122 hours per week.\nThere are 7*24=<<7*24=168>>168 hours per week.\nThus, Madeline has 168-122=<<168-122=46>>46 hours left over.\n#### 46"
