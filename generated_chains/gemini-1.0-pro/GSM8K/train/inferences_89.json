Every Friday, his number of borrowed books is about 40% higher than the daily average. How many books does he borrow in a week if the library is open from Monday to Friday?",

On Fridays, he borrows 40% more books than the daily average. So, on Friday, he borrows 40 + 40 * 0.4 = 56 books.\n\n3. In a week, he borrows 160 + 56 = 216 books.\n\nI hope it is correct: 216",
        "ground_truth": "The number of books borrowed on Friday is higher by 40 * 40/100 = <<40*40/100=16>>16 books.\nThere are 5 days from Monday to Friday inclusive, so Krystian borrows an average of 5 * 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 books during that time.\nWith Friday's increase in borrowings, during one week Krystian borrows 200 + 16 = <<200+16=216>>216 books.\n#### 216"
