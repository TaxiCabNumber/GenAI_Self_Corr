At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJason is mixing a batch of black paint. He needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. If he adds 900 ml of water, how much charcoal does he add?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the ratio of charcoal to water: 2 grams of charcoal / 30 ml of water\n2. Convert the amount of water from ml to grams: 900 ml * 1 gram / 1 ml = 900 grams\n3. Use the ratio to calculate the amount of charcoal needed: 900 grams of water * (2 grams of charcoal / 30 grams of water) = 60 grams of charcoal\nI hope it is correct: 60 grams",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many ml of water Jason needs for 1 gram of charcoal: 30 ml / 2 grams = <<30/2=15>>15 ml/g\nThen divide the amount of water Jason uses by the amount of water per gram of charcoal to find how much charcoal he uses: 900 ml / 15 ml/g = <<900/15=60>>60 g\n#### 60"
