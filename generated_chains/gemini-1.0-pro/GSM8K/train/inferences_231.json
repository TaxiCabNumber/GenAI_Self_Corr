At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in a fume hood, and 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them. Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present. If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?",
        "inference": "1. First, find the number of beakers that were tested with copper ions. Since 45 drops were used and 3 drops were used per beaker, 45 drops / 3 drops per beaker = 15 beakers with copper ions were tested.\n2. Then, subtract the number of beakers with copper ions from the total number of beakers to find the number of beakers without coppe ions that were tested. 22 beakers - 15 beakers with copper ions = 7 beakers without copper ions were tested. \n\nI hope it is correct: 7",
        "ground_truth": "There were 45 / 3 = <<45/3=15>>15 beakers tested to find all the beakers with copper ions.\nThus, 15 - 8 = <<15-8=7>>7 beakers without copper ions were tested.\n#### 7"
