At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRalph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?",
        "inference": "1. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. That means he hit 100 * 2/5 = 40 balls.\n2. Out of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. That means he hit 75 * 1/3 = 25 balls.\n3. Therefore, out of all the tennis balls, he hit 40 + 25 = 65 balls.\n4. Out of all the 175 tennis balls, he didn't hit 175 - 65 = 110 balls.\n\nI hope it is correct: 110",
