At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry\u2019s two daughters play softball on different teams. They each have 8 games this season. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play. If each game lasts for 2 hours, how many hours will Jerry spend at the field watching his daughters play and practice altogether?",
        "inference": "1. Each daughter has 8 games.\n2. Each game lasts for 2 hours.\n3. So, each daughter spends 8 x 2 = 16 hours playing games.\n4. Each team practices 4 hours for every game they play.\n5. So, each daughter spends 8 x 4 = 32 hours practicing.\n6. Therefore, each daughter spends 16 + 32 = 48 hours on games and practices.\n7. Jerry has two daughters.\n8. So, Jerry spends 48 x 2 = 96 hours on games and practices altogether.\nI hope it is correct: 96 hours",
