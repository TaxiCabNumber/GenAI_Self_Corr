At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAndy and Bob went to the canteen to buy snacks. They spent the same amount. Andy bought a can of soda at $1 and two hamburgers at $2 each.  Bob ordered two sandwiches for $3 and a can of fruit drink.  How much did Bob's fruit drink cost?",
        "inference": "Andy's bill = $1 + 2 x $2 = $5.\nSince Andy and Bob spent the same amount, Bob's bill was also $5.\nCost of two sandwiches = $3, so the cost of the fruit drink = $5 - $3 = $2.\nI hope it is correct: $2",
        "ground_truth": "Two hamburger cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.\nSo, Andy spent $1 + $4 = $<<1+4=5>>5.\nTherefore, Bob's fruit drink cost $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.\n#### 2"
