At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJan buys 1000 feet of cable.  She splits it up into 25-foot sections.  She gives 1/4 of that to a friend.  She then puts half of the rest in storage. How much does she keep on hand?",

Calculate the number of sections Jan puts in storage: 30 sections * 1/2 = 15 sections\n\n5.
