At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSonja makes her own peanut butter with peanuts and oil in a blender. She uses a ratio of two ounces of oil to smooth out every eight ounces of peanuts. Her last batch of peanut butter weighed 20 ounces. How many ounces of oil did she use?",
