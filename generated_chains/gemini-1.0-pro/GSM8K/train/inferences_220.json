At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it. How many more gallons of gas does he need to travel 600 miles, back and forth?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the miles per gallon for the car.\nMiles per gallon = distance traveled / gallons of gas used\nMiles per gallon = 400 miles / 20 gallons\nMiles per gallon = 20 miles per gallon\n\n2. Calculate the total distance Mr. Montero needs to travel.\nTotal distance = distance to destination + distance back\nTotal distance = 600 miles + 600 miles\nTotal distance = 1200 miles\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of gas Mr. Montero needs to travel the total distance.\nGallons of gas needed = total distance / miles per gallon\nGallons of gas needed = 1200 miles / 20 miles per gallon\nGallons of gas needed = 60 gallons\n\n4. Subtract the amount of gas Mr. Montero already has from the total amount of gas he needs.\nGallons of gas needed = 60 gallons - 8 gallons\nGallons of gas needed = 52 gallons\n\n**I hope it is correct: 52 gallons**",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Montero is traveling a total distance of 600 miles + 600 miles = <<600+600=1200>>1200 miles.\nThere are 1200 miles / 400 miles = <<1200/400=3>>3 sets of 400 miles in 1200 miles.\nSo Mr. Montero needs 20 gallons/set x 3 sets = <<20*3=60>>60 gallons in all.\nSince his car has 8 gallons already, then he needs to add 60 gallons - 8 gallons = <<60-8=52>>52 gallons more.\n#### 52"
