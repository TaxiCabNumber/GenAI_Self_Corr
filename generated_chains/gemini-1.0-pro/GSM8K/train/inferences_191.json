At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a section of the forest, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits. Three foxes invade this region and hunt the rodents. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. How many rabbits and weasels will be left after 3 weeks?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by each fox in 3 weeks:\n\nTotal weasels caught = 4 weasels/week * 3 weeks = 12 weasels\n\nTotal rabbits caught = 2 rabbits/week * 3 weeks = 6 rabbits\n\n2. Calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by all three foxes:\n\nTotal weasels caught = 12 weasels * 3 foxes = 36 weasels\n\nTotal rabbits caught = 6 rabbits * 3 foxes = 18 rabbits\n\n3. Subtract the total number of weasels and rabbits caught from the initial population to find the remaining population:\n\nRemaining weasels = 100 weasels - 36 weasels = 64 weasels\n\nRemaining rabbits = 50 rabbits - 18 rabbits = 32 rabbits\n\n**I hope it is correct: Remaining weasels = 64, Remaining rabbits = 32**",
