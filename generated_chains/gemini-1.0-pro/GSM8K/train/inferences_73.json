At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt is Roger\u2019s turn to provide a snack for the baseball team after the game and he has decided to bring trail mix. The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. Roger has 13 members on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches and 2 helpers. How many packs of trail mix does he need to buy?",
