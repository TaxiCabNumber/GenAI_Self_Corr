At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMissy had a giant piggy bank in her bedroom.  Every day she would search the house for change to put in her bank.  After 4 years, the bank was opened and it contained $450 in change.  If the second, third, and fourth-year she doubled the amount of money she put in the bank from the amount she had put in the previous year, how much money, in dollars, did she put in the bank the first year?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year as x.\n\nIn the second year, she doubled the amount, so she put in 2x.\n\nIn the third year, she doubled the amount again, so she put in 4x.\n\nIn the fourth year, she doubled the amount one last time, so she put in 8x.\n\nThe total amount of money in the bank after 4 years is the sum of the amounts she put in each year:\n\nx + 2x + 4x + 8x = 450\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n15x = 450\n\nDividing both sides by 15:\n\nx = 30\n\nTherefore, Missy put in $30 in the bank the first year.\n\nI hope it is correct: $30$",
        "ground_truth": "We let x be the amount of money she put in the bank the first year,\nThen the second year was 2*x,\nand the third year was 2*2*x=4*x,\nand the fourth year was 2*2*2*x=8*x.\nAnd the total amount she put in the bank, $450, is the sum of all four years, or $450 = x+(2*x)+(4*x)+(8*x).\nThis simplifies to $450=15*x.\nAnd therefore, the amount of money she put in the bank the first year was x=$<<30=30>>30.\n#### 30"
