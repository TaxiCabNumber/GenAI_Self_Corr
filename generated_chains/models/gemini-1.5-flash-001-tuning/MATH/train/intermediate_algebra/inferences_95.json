        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA famous theorem states that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there is a unique conic section (ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) which passes through all five points. The conic section passing through the five points \\[(-\\tfrac32, 1), \\; (0,0), \\;(0,2),\\; (3,0),\\; (3,2).\\]is an ellipse whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the length of its minor axis.",
        "inference": "Solution: \nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(3,2)$, which is $\\left( \\tfrac{3}{2}, 1 \\right)$. The ellipse passes through $(0,0)$, so the distance from the center of the ellipse to a point on the ellipse is $\\tfrac{3}{2}$.  The ellipse also passes through $(0,2)$, so the distance from the center to a point on the ellipse is $1$. These are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. Thus, the length of the minor axis is $2 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The four points $(0,0),$ $(0,2),$ $(3,0),$ and $(3,2)$ form a rectangle, and the horizontal line through $(-\\tfrac32, 1)$ bisects the rectangle. So, visually, we hope that the center of the ellipse coincides with the center of the rectangle, which has coordinates $\\left(\\tfrac32, 1\\right),$ and that its major axis should pass through the point $(-\\tfrac32, 1).$\n\nIn this case, the semimajor axis has length $\\tfrac32 - (-\\tfrac32) = 3.$ Then, its equation must take the form \\[\\frac{(x-\\tfrac32)^2}{3^2} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{b^2} = 1\\]where $b$ is the length of the semiminor axis. Since $(0,0)$ lies on the ellipse, setting $x=y=0,$ we have \\[\\frac{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1,\\]or $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1.$ Solving for $b$ gives $b = \\frac{2\\sqrt3}{3},$ so the length of the minor axis is $2b = \\boxed{\\frac{4\\sqrt3}{3}}.$"
