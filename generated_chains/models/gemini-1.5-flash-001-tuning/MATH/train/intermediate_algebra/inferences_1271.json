At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe coefficients of the polynomial\n\\[x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0\\]are all integers.  Let $n$ be the exact number of integer roots of the polynomial, counting multiplicity.  For example, the polynomial $(x + 3)^2 (x^2 + 4x + 11) = 0$ has two integer roots counting multiplicity, because the root $-3$ is counted twice.\n\nEnter all possible values of $n,$ separated by commas.",

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $-b,$ which is an integer.
