        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the complex number $z$ satisfying the equation $2z-3i\\bar{z}=-7+3i$.  Note that $\\bar{z}$ denotes the conjugate of $z$.",
        "inference": "Let $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then $\\bar{z}=x-yi$.  Substituting into the equation, we get \\[2(x+yi)-3i(x-yi)=-7+3i.\\]Expanding, we have \\[2x+2yi-3ix-3y=-7+3i.\\]Equating real and imaginary parts, we obtain the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n2x-3y&=-7, \\\\\n2y-3x&=3.\n\\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $x=-3$ and $y=1$.  Therefore, $z=\\boxed{-3+i}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{-3+i}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $-3i\\bar{z}=-3b-3ia$.  We now find that \\[ 2z-3i\\bar{z} = 2a+2ib -3b - 3ia = (2a-3b) + (2b-3a)i. \\]So if $2z-3i\\bar{z}=-7+3i$ then (by matching real and imaginary components) we must have $2a-3b=-7$ and $-3a+2b=3$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=1$ and $b=3$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{1+3i}$."
