        "inference": "The solution you provided is correct!  Here's a slightly more concise explanation:\n\n* **Understanding the Geometry:** Since $PA + PD = PB + PC = 8$, point $P$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AB$ and $CD$.  These bisectors intersect at the center of the square, which is the point $(0,0)$.\n\n* **Finding the Equation:**  We can directly use the fact that $P$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $CD$. This line passes through the midpoint of $CD$, which is $(0,1)$, and has slope 0.  Therefore, its equation is $y = 1$.\n\n* **Substituting:** Since $P$ is on the line $y=1$, we can substitute $y = 1$ into the equation $2x^2 y^2 + 55x^2 + 38y^2 - 81 = 0$. This gives us:\n   \n   $2x^2 + 55x^2 + 38 - 81 = 0$\n   \n   $57x^2 = 43$\n   \n   $x^2 = \\frac{43}{57}$\n\n* **Finding the Distance:**  The distance between the point $P = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{43}{57}}, 1 \\right)$ and the point $A = (-3,0)$ is:\n\n   $PA = \\sqrt{\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{43}{57}} + 3 \\right)^2 + 1^2}$\n\n   Simplifying, we get $PA = \\frac{83}{\\sqrt{57}}$.\n\n* **Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{83}$. \n",
