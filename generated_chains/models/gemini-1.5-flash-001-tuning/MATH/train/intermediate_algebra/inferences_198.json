        "inference": "You are absolutely correct! There's a mistake in the solution. The issue is that we cannot conclude that $p(x)$ must be a constant polynomial just because the right-hand side of the equation is bounded. The problem is that the terms in the sum on the right-hand side do not necessarily increase as $n$ increases.\n\nHere's a corrected approach:\n\nLet $q(x) = p(x^3).$  Then the given equation becomes\n\\[q(y) - q(y - 2) = q(\\sqrt[3]{y})^2 + 12.\\]Let $a = q(0),$ $b = q(1),$ and $c = q(-1).$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nq(2) - q(0) &= b^2 + 12, \\\\\nq(4) - q(2) &= a^2 + 12, \\\\\nq(6) - q(4) &= c^2 + 12, \\\\\nq(8) - q(6) &= b^2 + 12,\n\\end{align*}and so on.  Adding these equations, we get\n\\[q(2n) - q(0) = (n - 1)(b^2 + a^2 + c^2) + 12n.\\]Since $q(x)$ is a polynomial, the left-hand side is bounded as $n$ goes to infinity.  Therefore, the right-hand side must also be bounded, which means $b^2 + a^2 + c^2 = 0.$  This forces $a = b = c = 0.$\n\nThen $q(0) = q(1) = q(-1) = 0.$  Since $q(x)$ is a polynomial, this means $q(x)$ is divisible by $x(x - 1)(x + 1).$  But\n\\[q(y) - q(y - 2) = q(\\sqrt[3]{y})^2 + 12\\]for all $y,$ so $q(x)$ is also divisible by $x - 2.$  This means $q(x)$ is divisible by $x(x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2).$\n\nSince $q(x) = p(x^3),$ $p(x)$ is divisible by $(x^3)(x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1)(x^3 - 2).$  But $p(x)$ is a polynomial, so $p(x)$ must be a constant polynomial.\n\nLet $p(x) = c.$  Then the given equation becomes\n\\[c - c = c^2 + 12,\\]so $c^2 + 12 = 0.$  This equation has no real solutions, so there is $\\boxed{\\text{no solution}}.$\n",
