This equation does not have any integer solutions, as we can test by finding that the discriminant is less than zero, $(-1)^2-4(1)(2)=-7$.\n\nIf $b=-1, d=5$, then $ac+b+d=ac+4=-2$, so $ac=-6$. We substitute $a=1-c$ from the first equation to get the quadratic $c^2-c-6=0$, which has solutions $c=-2$ (so $a=3$) or $c=3$ (so $a=-2$). In either case, we get that $a+b+c+d=\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe remaining equation, $ad + bc = 17$, tells us that the coefficients are $a = 3, b = -1, c = -2, d = 5.$"
