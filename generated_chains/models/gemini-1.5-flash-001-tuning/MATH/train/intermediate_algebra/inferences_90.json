        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the polynomial has *only* integer roots.  The Integer Root Theorem only tells us that *if* the polynomial has an integer root, then that root must divide the constant term. \n\nTo find the possible values of *a*, we need to use the fact that the polynomial has a root of multiplicity 2. This means the polynomial can be factored as  (x + 1)\u00b2(x + b) for some value of *b*. Expanding this, we get:\n\nx\u00b3 + (2 + b)x\u00b2 + (2b + 1)x + b = x\u00b3 + 3x\u00b2 + ax + 7\n\nMatching coefficients, we get:\n\n2 + b = 3\n2b + 1 = a\nb = 7\n\nSolving these equations, we find *a* = 15 and *b* = 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of *a* is **15**. \n",
