I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. Suppose that $f(1)=0$, $50<f(7)<60$, $70<f(8)<80$, $5000k<f(100)<5000(k+1)$ for some integer $k$. What is $k$?",
        "inference": "Since $f(1)=0$, we know that $a+b+c=0$.  Therefore, $c=-a-b$.  Substituting into the definition of $f(x)$, we get\n\\[f(x)=ax^2+bx-a-b.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(7)&=49a+7b-a-b=48a+6b, \\\\\nf(8)&=64a+8b-a-b=63a+7b, \\\\\nf(100)&=10000a+100b-a-b=9999a+99b.\n\\end{align*}Since $50<f(7)<60$, $70<f(8)<80$, and $5000k<f(100)<5000(k+1)$, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n50&<48a+6b<60, \\\\\n70&<63a+7b<80, \\\\\n5000k&<9999a+99b<5000(k+1).\n\\end{align*}From the first two inequalities, we can solve for $a$ and $b$.
