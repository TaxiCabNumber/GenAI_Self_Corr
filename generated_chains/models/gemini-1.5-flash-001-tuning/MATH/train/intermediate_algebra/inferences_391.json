        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that because $[p(x)]^3 - x$ is a cubic polynomial, it must be a multiple of $(x-1)(x+1)(x-8)$.  This is not necessarily true. For example, $x^3 - x$ is a cubic polynomial, but it's not a multiple of $(x-1)(x+1)(x-8)$.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to use the fact that $[p(x)]^3 - x$ is **divisible** by $(x-1)(x+1)(x-8)$. This means there exists a polynomial $q(x)$ such that:\n\n$$[p(x)]^3 - x = (x-1)(x+1)(x-8) q(x)$$\n\nSubstituting $x=1$, $x=-1$, and $x=8$ into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$[p(1)]^3 - 1 = 0$$\n$$[p(-1)]^3 + 1 = 0$$\n$$[p(8)]^3 - 8 = 0$$\n\nTherefore, $p(1) = 1$, $p(-1) = -1$, and $p(8) = 2$.  The rest of the solution proceeds as before.\n\nLet $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.  Then\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= 1, \\\\\na - b + c &= -1, \\\\\n64a + 8b + c &= 2.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = \\frac{1}{12},$ $b = \\frac{1}{3},$ and $c = \\frac{1}{4}.$  Therefore,\n\\[p(13) = \\frac{1}{12} \\cdot 13^2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 13 + \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{221}{12}}.\\]\n",
