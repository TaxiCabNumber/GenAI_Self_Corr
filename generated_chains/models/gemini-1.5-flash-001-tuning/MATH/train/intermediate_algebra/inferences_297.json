I hope it is correct.'\nAn ellipse has foci at $F_1 = (0,2)$ and $F_2 = (3,0).$  The ellipse intersects the $x$-axis at the origin, and one other point.  What is the other point of intersection?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nLet the other point of intersection be $(a,0)$.  Since the ellipse intersects the $x$-axis at the origin, the center of the ellipse is $\\left( \\frac{a}{2}, 1 \\right).$  The distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus is $\\frac{a}{2}$ and $1,$ respectively.  The sum of these distances is equal to the length of the major axis, which is $a.$  Therefore,\n\\[\\frac{a}{2} + 1 = a.\\]Solving for $a,$ we find $a = \\boxed{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
