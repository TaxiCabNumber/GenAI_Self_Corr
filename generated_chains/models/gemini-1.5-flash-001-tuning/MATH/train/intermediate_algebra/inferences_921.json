This means that one of the roots must be real.  Let the roots be $r$, $s$, and $t$, where $r$ is real and $s$ and $t$ are complex.

Since $r$ is real and $s$ and $t$ are complex conjugates, the product $rst$ is also real.  Therefore, $r = \\frac{3}{kt}$, and so $-\\frac{3k-2}{k} = \\frac{3}{kt}$.

        "inference": "The error is in assuming that there are exactly two complex roots. The problem only states that there are exactly two complex roots *in addition to a real root*.  Therefore, there must be a total of three roots, and we can apply Vieta's formulas directly without assuming anything about the nature of the roots.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe equation we obtained is:  \n$$kx^3 + (3k-2)x^2 + (2k-3)x = 0$$\n\nThis equation has three roots, let's call them $r$, $s$, and $t$.  By Vieta's formulas:\n\n*  $r + s + t = -\\frac{3k-2}{k}$ \n*  $rs + rt + st = \\frac{2k-3}{k}$\n*  $rst = -\\frac{3}{k}$\n\nThe problem states that there are exactly two complex roots.  Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real, the complex roots must be conjugates of each other.  Let $s$ and $t$ be the complex roots.  Then, $s + t$ and $st$ are both real.  \n\nNow, consider the equation $r + s + t = -\\frac{3k-2}{k}$.  Since $s + t$ is real, $r$ must also be real.\n\nNext, consider the equation $rst = -\\frac{3}{k}$.  Since $s$ and $t$ are complex conjugates, their product $st$ is real.  Therefore, $r$ must also be real. \n\nSince $r$ is real, we can use Vieta's formulas to solve for $k$.  Let's focus on the equation $rst = -\\frac{3}{k}$. Since $r$ is real and $st$ is real, we can divide both sides by $st$ to get $r = -\\frac{3}{kst}$.\n\nNow, substitute this value of $r$ into the equation $r + s + t = -\\frac{3k-2}{k}$:\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{kst} + s + t = -\\frac{3k-2}{k}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $kst$ gives:\n\n$$-3 + kst^2 + kst^2 = -(3k-2)st$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$2kst^2 + (3k-2)st - 3 = 0$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $st$.  Using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$st = \\frac{-(3k-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(3k-2)^2 + 24k}}{4k}$$\n\nSince $st$ is real, the discriminant must be non-negative:\n\n$$(3k-2)^2 + 24k \\ge 0$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$9k^2 + 12k + 4 \\ge 0$$\n\nThis factors as $(3k+2)^2 \\ge 0$, which is always true.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that $rst = -\\frac{3}{k}$ and $st = \\frac{-(3k-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(3k-2)^2 + 24k}}{4k}$ to solve for $r$. After some algebraic manipulation, we arrive at:\n\n$$r = \\frac{-6k \\pm \\sqrt{(3k-2)^2 + 24k}}{3k-2}$$\n\nSince $r$ is real, the discriminant must be non-negative.  This leads to the same inequality as before: $(3k+2)^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, the only restriction on $k$ is that it cannot be equal to $-\\frac{2}{3}$. However, since the original equation has a denominator of $x + 1$,  $k$ cannot be equal to $0$ either.  \n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n\\\\boxed{$k \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0, -\\frac{2}{3}\\}$}. \n",
