        "inference": "Since the graph has vertical asymptotes at $2$ and $-2$, $q(x)$ must have factors of $(x - 2)$ and $(x + 2)$.  Also, since there is no horizontal asymptote, the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than or equal to the degree of $x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 3$, which is 3.  Therefore, $q(x)$ must be of the form $a(x - 2)(x + 2)$, where $a$ is a constant.\n\nWe are given that $q(3) = 15$, so\n\\[15 = a(3 - 2)(3 + 2) = 5a.\\]Then $a = 3$, so $q(x) = 3(x - 2)(x + 2) = \\boxed{3x^2 - 12}$.",

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the degree of $q(x)$ must be less than or equal to the degree of $x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 3$.  This is not necessarily true; for example, if $q(x) = (x^2 - 4)(x - 1)$, then the graph of $y = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 3}{(x^2 - 4)(x - 1)}$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = 2$, $x = -2$, and $x = 1$, and no horizontal asymptote.\n\nInstead, we should use the fact that the graph has a hole at $x = 1$.  This means $q(x)$ must have a factor of $(x - 1)$.  Since $q(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = 2$ and $x = -2$, it must also have factors of $(x - 2)$ and $(x + 2)$.
