        "inference": "The horizontal asymptote of a rational function where the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same is the ratio of the leading coefficients. In this case, the horizontal asymptote is $y=\\frac{2}{1}=2$.  To find where the function crosses the horizontal asymptote, we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 2$.

When the leading terms of the numerator and denominator have the same degree, that line is at the value equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients, namely $y = 2/1 = 2$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$f(x) = 2 = \\frac{2x^2 - 5x - 7}{x^2 - 4x + 1}.$$Clearing the denominator, $$2(x^2 - 4x + 1) = 2x^2 - 8x + 2 = 2x^2 - 5x - 7 \\Longrightarrow 3x = 9 \\Longrightarrow x = \\boxed{3}.$$"
