At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the set of 30 parabolas defined as follows: all parabolas have as focus the point $(0,0)$ and the directrix lines have the form $y=ax+b$ with $a$ and $b$ integers such that $a\\in \\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$ and $b\\in \\{-3,-2,-1,1,2,3\\}$. No three of these parabolas have a common point. How many points in the plane are on two of these parabolas?",

        "ground_truth": "If two parabolas have the same focus, and their directrices intersect, then the parabolas intersect in exactly two points.\n\nSuppose two parabolas have the same focus and their directrices are parallel.  If the focus lies between the two directrices, then the parabolas again intersect in exactly two points.  However, if the focus does not between the two directrices, then the parabolas do not intersect.\n\nThere are $\\binom{30}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of parabolas.  In terms of $a$ and $b,$ the parabolas do not intersect when their slopes $a$ are the same, and their $b$-values have the same sign (because this is when the focus does not lie between the two directrices).  There are five ways to choose the value of $a,$ and $\\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the values of $b$ (either both are negative or both are positive).  Hence, the total number of intersection points is\n\\[2 \\left( \\binom{30}{2} - 5 \\cdot 6 \\right) = \\boxed{810}.\\]"
