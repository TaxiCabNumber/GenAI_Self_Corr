The solution above incorrectly assumes that $a_9$ is a weighted average of only $a_1$ and $a_2$.  \n\n**To get the correct answer, we need to use the fact that each term is the average of all the terms before it.** \n\nSince $a_9$ is the average of $a_1$ through $a_8$, we can write:\n\n* $a_9 = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8}{8}$\n\nNotice that $a_8 = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7}{7}$, and so on. We can keep substituting these average expressions until we have a final equation only involving $a_1$ and $a_2$.  However, this will be quite tedious.\n\n**A more efficient approach is to realize that the terms form a geometric progression.** This is because each term is the average of the previous terms, which means the difference between consecutive terms is always the same. \n\nLet the common difference between consecutive terms be $d$. We know:\n\n* $a_2 = a_1 + d$\n* $a_3 = a_2 + d = a_1 + 2d$\n* ...\n* $a_9 = a_1 + 8d$\n\nWe are given $a_1 = 19$ and $a_9 = 99$. Substituting these into the equation for $a_9$, we get:\n\n* $99 = 19 + 8d$\n* $80 = 8d$\n* $d = 10$\n\nTherefore, $a_2 = a_1 + d = 19 + 10 = \\boxed{29}$. \n",
