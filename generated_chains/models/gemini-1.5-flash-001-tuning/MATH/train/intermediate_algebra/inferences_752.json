At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $a<0$ and $a<b<c$. Which of the following must be true?\n\n$ab < bc$\n$ac<bc$\n$ab< ac$\n$a+b<b+c$\n$c/a <1$\n\nEnter your answer as a list of those options that are always true.
