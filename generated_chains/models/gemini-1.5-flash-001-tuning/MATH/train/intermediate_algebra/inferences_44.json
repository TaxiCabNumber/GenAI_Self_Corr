        "inference": "The error in the solution is that the equation does not simplify to a single line in the first quadrant. The equation $|x-60|+|y|=\\left|\\frac{x}{4}\\right|$ actually defines a more complex shape. Here's a corrected approach:\n\n**1. Analyze the Equation**\n\nThe equation involves absolute values, which means we need to consider different cases:\n\n* **Case 1: x \u2265 60**\n   *  x - 60 + y = x/4\n   *  y = -3x/4 + 60 \n\n* **Case 2: 0 \u2264 x < 60**\n   *  60 - x + y = x/4\n   *  y = 5x/4 - 60\n\n* **Case 3: x < 0**\n    *  60 - x + y = -x/4\n    *  y = -3x/4 - 60\n\n**2. Sketch the Graph**\n\nPlot the lines defined by the equations in each case. Notice that the graph will be symmetric across both the x and y axes. You'll find that the shape in the first quadrant is a trapezoid.\n\n**3. Calculate the Area**\n\n* **Base 1:**  Intersection of y = -3x/4 + 60 with the y-axis is (0,60).\n* **Base 2:** Intersection of y = 5x/4 - 60 with the y-axis is (0,-60). \n* **Height:** Intersection of y = -3x/4 + 60 and y = 5x/4 - 60  is (60,0).  So, the height is 60.\n\nArea of the trapezoid = (1/2) * (60 + 60) * 60 = 3600\n\n**4. Total Area**\n\nSince the shape is symmetrical about both axes, the total area is 4 times the area in the first quadrant.\n\nTotal Area = 4 * 3600 = **14400**\n\nTherefore, the area of the region defined by the equation is  \\\\boxed{14400}. \n",
