        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution.  The problem likely involves a fraction, and we need to be careful about potential division by zero.  \n\n**Here's a corrected approach:**\n\nLet's assume the original problem was:\n\n**(x + 45)/(x - 4) = -10**\n\nTo solve this, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by (x - 4):** \n   x + 45 = -10(x - 4)\n\n2. **Expand the right side:**\n   x + 45 = -10x + 40\n\n3. **Combine x terms:**\n   11x = -5\n\n4. **Solve for x:**\n   x = -5/11\n\n**Final Answer:**  $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{11}}$ \n",
