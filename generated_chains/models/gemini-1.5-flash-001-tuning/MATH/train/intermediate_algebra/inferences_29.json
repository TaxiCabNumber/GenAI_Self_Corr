On the other hand, if $k + 221 = 0,$ then this equation is only satisfied when $x-5 = 0$ and $y+7=0,$ so the graph of the equation only consists of a single point. And if $k + 221 < 0,$ then no points $(x, y)$ satisfy this equation. Therefore, the graph is a non-degenerate ellipse if and only if $k + 221 > 0,$ that is, $k > -221.$ Thus, $a = \\boxed{-221}.$"
