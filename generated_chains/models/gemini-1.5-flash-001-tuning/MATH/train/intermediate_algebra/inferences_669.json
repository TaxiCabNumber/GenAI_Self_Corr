At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $x^3 -ax^2 + bx -2010$ has three positive integer roots. What is the smallest possible value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Let the roots of the polynomial be $r$, $s$, and $t$.  Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s+t=a$, $rs+rt+st=b$, and $rst=2010$.  Since 2010 is divisible by 2 and 5, one of the roots must be even, and one of the roots must be a multiple of 5.  The smallest possible even root is 2, and the smallest possible multiple of 5 is 5.  Therefore, $a=2+5+t=7+t$.  To minimize $a$, we want to minimize $t$.  Since $rst=2010=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot67$, the smallest possible value of $t$ is 3.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $7+3=\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "By Vieta's Formulas, we know that $a$ is the sum of the three roots of the polynomial $x^3-ax^2+bx-2010$. Again Vieta's Formulas tells us that $2010$ is the product of the three integer roots. Also, $2010$ factors into $2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot67$. But, since there are only three roots to the polynomial, two of the four prime factors must be multiplied so that we are left with three roots. To minimize $a$, $2$ and $3$ should be multiplied, which means $a$ will be $6+5+67=\\boxed{78}.$"
