At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Zuminglish, all words consist only of the letters $M, O,$ and $P$. As in English, $O$ is said to be a vowel and $M$ and $P$ are consonants. A string of $M's, O's,$ and $P's$ is a word in Zuminglish if and only if between any two $O's$ there appear at least two consonants. Let $N$ denote the number of $10$-letter Zuminglish words. Determine the remainder obtained when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",

The other equations follow because if we have an $n$-letter Zuminglish word ending in $k$ consonants, then to make an $(n+1)$-letter Zuminglish word ending in $k$ consonants we can either add an $O$ to an $(n-1)$-letter Zuminglish word ending in $k-1$ consonants or we can add an $O$ to an $(n-1)$-letter Zuminglish word ending in $k-2$ consonants.\n\nWe calculate the following values of $f(n,k)$:\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2,0)&=3, \\\\\nf(2,1)&=3, \\\\\nf(2,2)&=2, \\\\\nf(3,0)&=5, \\\\\nf(3,1)&=5, \\\\\nf(3,2)&=5, \\\\\nf(4,0)&=10, \\\\\nf(4,1)&=10, \\\\\nf(4,2)&=10, \\\\\nf(5,0)&=20, \\\\\nf(5,1)&=20, \\\\\nf(5,2)&=20, \\\\\nf(6,0)&=40, \\\\\nf(6,1)&=40, \\\\\nf(6,2)&=40, \\\\\nf(7,0)&=80, \\\\\nf(7,1)&=80, \\\\\nf(7,2)&=80, \\\\\nf(8,0)&=160, \\\\\nf(8,1)&=160, \\\\\nf(8,2)&=160, \\\\\nf(9,0)&=320, \\\\\nf(9,1)&=320, \\\\\nf(9,2)&=320, \\\\\nf(10,0)&=640, \\\\\nf(10,1)&=640, \\\\\nf(10,2)&=640.\n\\end{align*}\nThe total number of $10$-letter Zuminglish words is $f(10,0)+f(10,1)+f(10,2)=640+640+640=1920$.
