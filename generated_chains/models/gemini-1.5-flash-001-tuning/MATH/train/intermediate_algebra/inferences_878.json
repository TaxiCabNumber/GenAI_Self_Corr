At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $x$, $y$, and $z$ be positive real numbers such that $(x \\cdot y) + z = (x + z) \\cdot (y + z)$. What is the maximum possible value of $xyz$?",

Factoring out a $z$ gives $z(x + y + z) = 0$.  Since $z$ is positive, we must have $x + y + z = 0$.  Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive, this is impossible.  Therefore, there are no solutions to the given equation, and there is no maximum possible value of $xyz$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{DNE}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The condition is equivalent to $z^2+(x+y-1)z=0$. Since $z$ is positive, $z=1-x-y$, so $x+y+z=1$. By the AM-GM inequality, $$xyz \\leq \\left(\\frac{x+y+z}{3}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{27}},$$with equality when $x=y=z=\\frac{1}{3}$."
