At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $x^3 - 2004 x^2 + mx + n$ has integer coefficients and three distinct positive zeros.  Exactly one of these is an integer, and it is the sum of the other two.  How many values of $n$ are possible?",
        "inference": "Let the roots of the polynomial be $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the integer root.  Then $c = a + b$.  By Vieta's formulas,\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c &= 2004, \\\\\nab + ac + bc &= m, \\\\\nabc &= -n.\n\\end{align*}Since $c = a + b$, $2c = 2004$, so $c = 1002$.  Then $a + b = 1002$, so $ab = m - ac - bc = m - 1002a - 1002b = m - 1002(a + b) = m - 1002004$.  Also, $-n = abc = c(ab) = 1002(m - 1002004)$.  Thus, $n = -1002(m - 1002004)$.\n\nSince $m$ is an integer, $n$ can be any integer multiple of $-1002$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive, $ab = m - 1002004$ must be positive, so $m > 1002004$.  Thus, $n$ can take on any value of the form $-1002k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.  There are infinitely many such values, so there are $\\boxed{\\infty}$ possible values of $n$.",
