I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers such that the greatest common divisor of $x^2+ax+b$ and $x^2+bx+c$ is $x+1$ (in the set of polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients), and the least common multiple of $x^2+ax+b$ and $x^2+bx+c$ is $x^3-4x^2+x+6$.  Find $a+b+c$.",
        "inference": "Since the greatest common divisor of $x^2+ax+b$ and $x^2+bx+c$ is $x+1$, both polynomials must have a root of $-1$.  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n(-1)^2 + a(-1) + b &= 0, \\\\\n(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = b + 1$ and $b = c + 1$.\n\nThe least common multiple of $x^2+ax+b$ and $x^2+bx+c$ is $x^3-4x^2+x+6 = (x+1)(x-2)(x-3)$.  Since the greatest common divisor is $x+1$, one of $x^2+ax+b$ and $x^2+bx+c$ must be $(x+1)(x-2) = x^2-x-2$, and the other must be $(x+1)(x-3) = x^2-2x-3$.\n\nIf $x^2+ax+b = x^2-x-2$, then $a = -1$ and $b = -2$.  Then $c = b - 1 = -3$, and $a + b + c = -1 - 2 - 3 = \\boxed{-6}$.\n\nIf $x^2+ax+b = x^2-2x-3$, then $a = -2$ and $b = -3$.  Then $c = b - 1 = -4$, and $a + b + c = -2 - 3 - 4 = \\boxed{-9}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $x+1$ divides $x^2+ax+b$ and the constant term is $b$, we have $x^2+ax+b=(x+1)(x+b)$, and similarly $x^2+bx+c=(x+1)(x+c)$.  Therefore, $a=b+1=c+2$.  Furthermore, the least common multiple of the two polynomials is $(x+1)(x+b)(x+b-1)=x^3-4x^2+x+6$, so $b=-2$.  Thus $a=-1$ and $c=-3$, and $a+b+c=\\boxed{-6}$."
