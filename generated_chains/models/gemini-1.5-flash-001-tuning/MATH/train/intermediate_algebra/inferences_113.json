        "inference": "You are correct! There's a mistake in the solution. The question likely asks for the distance between the foci of the ellipse, not the distance between the endpoints of the major axis. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe equation of the ellipse is in standard form, which tells us the center is at $(1,0)$, the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 2.  To find the distance between the foci, we use the formula $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, where $a$ is the major radius and $b$ is the minor radius.  Substituting, we get $c^2 = 6^2 - 2^2 = 32$, so $c = 4\\sqrt{2}$.  The distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}}$. \n",
