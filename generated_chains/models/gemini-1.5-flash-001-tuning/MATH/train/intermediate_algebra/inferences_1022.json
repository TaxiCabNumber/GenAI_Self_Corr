We complete the square in both $x$ and $y$: \\begin{align*}\n2x^2 + y^2 + 8x - 10y + c &= 0 \\\\\n2(x^2 + 4x) + (y^2 - 10y) + c &= 0 \\\\\n2(x^2 + 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 10y + 25) + c - 8 - 25 &= 0 \\\\\n2(x + 2)^2 + (y - 5)^2 + c - 33 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}For this to represent a single point, the right-hand side must be 0, and both $(x+2)^2$ and $(y-5)^2$ must be 0.

Completing the square in both variables, we have \\[\\begin{aligned} 2(x^2+4x) + (y^2-10y) + c &= 0 \\\\ 2(x^2+4x+4) + (y^2-10y+25) + c &= 33 \\\\ 2(x+2)^2 + (y-5)^2 &= 33-c. \\end{aligned}\\]To get this equation in standard form, we would normally try to divide by $33-c,$ and if $33-c>0,$ then we get the standard form of a (non-degenerate) ellipse. But we cannot do so if $33-c=0.$ Indeed, if $33-c=0,$ then only one point $(x,y)$ satisfies the equation, because both $x+2$ and $y+5$ must be zero for the left-hand side to equal zero. (And if $33-c < 0$, then no points satisfy the equation, because the right-hand side is always nonnegative.) Thus, the value of $c$ that makes a degenerate ellipse satisfies $33-c=0,$ so $c=\\boxed{33}.$"
