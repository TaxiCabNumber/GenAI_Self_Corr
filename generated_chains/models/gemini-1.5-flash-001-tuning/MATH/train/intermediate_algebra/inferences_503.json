At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the integer $k^{}_{}$ is added to each of the numbers $36^{}_{}$, $300^{}_{}$, and $596^{}_{}$, one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find $k^{}_{}$.",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive terms of the arithmetic series be $a - d$, $a$, and $a + d$. Then we have  \\[(a - d)^2 = 36 + k,\\]\\[a^2 = 300 + k,\\]and \\[(a + d)^2 = 596 + k.\\]Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $2ad - d^2 = 264$. Subtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get $2ad + d^2 = 296$. Adding these two equations, we get $4ad = 560$, so $ad = 140$. Substituting $ad = 140$ into the equation $2ad - d^2 = 264$, we get $280 - d^2 = 264$, so $d^2 = 16$. Since $d$ is positive, $d = 4$. Then $a = \\frac{ad}{d} = \\frac{140}{4} = 35$. Therefore, $k = a^2 - 300 = 35^2 - 300 = \\boxed{925}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{925}$. I hope it is correct.",
