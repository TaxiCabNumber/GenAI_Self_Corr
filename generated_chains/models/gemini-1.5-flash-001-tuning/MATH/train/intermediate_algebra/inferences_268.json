        "inference": "We start by completing the square in the denominator: \\[x^2-x+1 = \\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}.\\]Since $\\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $x$, we have \\[\\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4} \\ge \\frac{3}{4}.\\]Therefore, \\[\\frac{1}{\\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}} \\le \\frac{4}{3}.\\]Since $x$ can be any real number, we can make $x - \\frac{1}{2}$ arbitrarily close to $0$, so we can make $\\frac{1}{\\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}}$ arbitrarily large.  Therefore, the range of $\\frac{1}{\\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3}{4}}$ is $\\left( 0, \\frac{4}{3} \\right]$.

Since the function is continuous, it must take on all values in between.",

Therefore, the range of $f$ consists exactly of the values of $y$ which satisfy \\[(y+1)^2 - 4y^2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[0 \\ge 3y^2 - 2y - 1.\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (3y+1)(y-1),\\]which means that the solutions to the inequality are given by $-\\tfrac13 \\le y \\le 1.$ Therefore, the range of $g$ is the closed interval $\\boxed{[-\\tfrac13, 1]}.$"
