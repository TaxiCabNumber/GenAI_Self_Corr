        "inference": "First, we divide both sides of the equation by 400 to obtain \\[\\frac{x^2}{400} + \\frac{y^2}{100} = 1.\\]Thus, the major radius is $a = \\sqrt{400} = 20$ and the minor radius is $b = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.  The distance between the foci is $2c$, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$.  We have that $c^2 = 400 - 100 = 300$, so $c = \\sqrt{300} = 10 \\sqrt{3}$.  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{20 \\sqrt{3}}$.  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing by $400,$ we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{20^2} + \\frac{y^2}{10^2} = 1.\\]Thus, the length of the major and minor axes are $2 \\cdot 20 = 40$ and $2 \\cdot 10 = 20,$ respectively. Then the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\\sqrt{40^2 - 20^2} = \\boxed{20\\sqrt3}.$"
