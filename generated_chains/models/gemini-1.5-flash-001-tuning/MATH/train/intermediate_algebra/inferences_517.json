At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFunctions that aren't invertible can be made invertible by restricting their domains. For example, the function $x^2$ is invertible if we restrict $x$ to the interval $[0,\\infty)$, or to any subset of that interval. In that case, the inverse function is $\\sqrt x$. (We could also restrict $x^2$ to the domain $(-\\infty,0]$, in which case the inverse function would be $-\\sqrt{x}$.)\n\nSimilarly, by restricting the domain of the function $f(x) = 2x^2-4x-5$ to an interval, we can make it invertible. What is the largest such interval that includes the point $x=0$?",
