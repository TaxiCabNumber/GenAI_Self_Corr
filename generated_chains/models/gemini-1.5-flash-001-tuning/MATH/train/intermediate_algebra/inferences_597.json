        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution.  The problem asks for the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x+1)^3$, not $(x+1)^2$. Here's the corrected solution:\n\nWe know the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x+1)$ is 1. \n\nLet the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x+1)^3$ be $cx^2 + dx + e$. Then we can write:\n\n$$x^{100} = (x+1)^3 q(x) + cx^2 + dx + e$$\n\nfor some polynomial $q(x)$.  \n\nSetting $x = -1$, we get:\n\n$$1 = c - d + e$$\n\nLet's try to express the remainder in a different form:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^{100} &= (x+1)^3 q(x) + cx^2 + dx + e \\\\\n&= (x+1)^3 q(x) + c(x+1)^2 - (2c-d)(x+1) + (c-d+e) \\\\\n&= (x+1)^3 q(x) + c(x+1)^2 - (2c-d)(x+1) + 1 \n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x+1)^2$ is 1, we know that $c(x+1)^2 - (2c-d)(x+1) + 1$ must be a multiple of $(x+1)^2$. This means the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term must be zero:\n\n* **Coefficient of x:**  $2c - d = 0$\n* **Constant term:** $c - 2c + d + 1 = 0$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get $c = d = 0$.  Substituting back into $1 = c - d + e$, we find $e = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $x^{100}$ is divided by $(x+1)^3$ is $\\boxed{1}$. \n",
