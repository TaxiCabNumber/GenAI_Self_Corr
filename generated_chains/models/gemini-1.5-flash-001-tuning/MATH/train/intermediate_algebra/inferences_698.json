At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSolve the inequality\n\\[-12x^2 + 3x - 5 < 0.\\]",
        "inference": "First, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $-1,$ to obtain\n\\[12x^2 - 3x + 5 > 0.\\]The quadratic $12x^2 - 3x + 5$ has discriminant $(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 5 = -231,$ which is negative.  Thus, $12x^2 - 3x + 5$ is always positive, so the solution to the inequality is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}.$  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $3^2 - 4(-12)(-5) = -231,$ which is negative.  Therefore, the quadratic $-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$ has no real roots.\n\nFurthermore, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-12,$ which means that parabola is downward facing.  Therefore, the inequalities is satisfied for all real numbers $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}.$"
