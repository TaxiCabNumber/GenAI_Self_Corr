        "inference": "The graph has a vertical asymptote at $x = 1$ and a hole at $x = 0$.  Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, it must have a factor of $x$ and a factor of $x-1$ to create these features.  Thus, we can write $q(x) = a(x-1)x$ for some constant $a$.  Since $q(2) = 2$, we have $2 = a(2 - 1)(2)$, so $a = 1$.  Therefore, $q(x) = (x-1)x$.\n\nSince the graph has a horizontal asymptote at $y = 1$, the degree of $p(x)$ must also be 2.  Also, since there is a hole at $x = 0$, the function $p(x)$ must have a factor of $x$.  Thus, we can write $p(x) = bx(x + c)$ for some constants $b$ and $c$.  Since $p(3) = 3$, we have $3 = b(3)(3 + c)$, so $3 = 9b(3 + c)$.  Since the horizontal asymptote is $y = 1$, we know that the leading coefficients of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are equal, so $b = 1$.  Therefore, $p(x) = x(x + c)$ and $3 = 9(3 + c)$, so $c = -2$.  Thus, $p(x) = x(x - 2)$.\n\nTherefore, $p(x) + q(x) = x(x - 2) + (x - 1)x = \\boxed{2x^2 - 3x}$.",
