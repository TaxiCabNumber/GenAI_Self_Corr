At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn the first day, Barry Sotter used his magic wand to make an object's length increase by $\\frac{1}{2}$, meaning that if the length of the object was originally $x,$ then it is now $x + \\frac{1}{2} x.$  On the second day he increased the object's longer length by $\\frac{1}{3}$; on the third day he increased the object's new length by $\\frac{1}{4}$; and so on. On the $n^{\\text{th}}$ day of performing this trick, Barry will make the object's length exactly 100 times its original length. What is the value of $n$?",
        "inference": "Let $y$ be the object's length after $n$ days.  We know that $y=100x$.  After the first day, the length is $\\frac{3}{2}x$. After the second day, the length is $\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{2}x=2x$. After the third day, the length is $\\frac{5}{4}\\cdot2x=\\frac{5}{2}x$. The pattern is that the length after $n$ days is $\\frac{n+2}{n+1}x$. Therefore, we have that $\\frac{n+2}{n+1}x=100x$, which means that $n+2=100(n+1)$.  Solving for $n$ gives us $n=\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "On day $n$, Barry increases the length of the object by a factor of $\\frac{n+2}{n+1}$.

        "inference": "The error is in the assumption that the length after $n$ days is $\\frac{n+2}{n+1}x$. This is incorrect because the growth factor changes with each day. \n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nLet $y$ be the object's length after $n$ days. We know that $y = 100x$. \n\nWe can write the length after each day as:\n\n* Day 1: $\\frac{3}{2}x$\n* Day 2: $\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}x = 2x$\n* Day 3: $\\frac{5}{4} \\cdot 2x = \\frac{5}{2}x$\n\nNotice that the growth factor is always one more than the previous day's denominator, divided by the previous day's denominator.  \n\nTherefore, we can express the length after $n$ days as:\n\n$y = \\frac{n+2}{n+1} \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n}{n-1} \\dots \\frac{3}{2}x$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$y = \\frac{n+2}{2}x$\n\nWe know that $y = 100x$.  Setting these equal, we have:\n\n$\\frac{n+2}{2}x = 100x$\n\nDividing both sides by $x$ and multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n\n$n + 2 = 200$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n$n = \\boxed{198}$ \n",
