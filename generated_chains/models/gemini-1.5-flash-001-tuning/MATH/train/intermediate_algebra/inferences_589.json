At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA function $f$ is defined on the complex numbers by $f(z)=(a+bi)z,$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers. This function has the property that for each complex number $z$, $f(z)$ is equidistant from both $z$ and the origin. Given that $|a+bi|=8$, find $b^2.$",
