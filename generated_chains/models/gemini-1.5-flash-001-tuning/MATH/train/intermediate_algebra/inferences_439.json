        "inference": "Since the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$, the degree of $p(x)$ must be less than the degree of $q(x)$.  Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, $p(x)$ must be linear.  Since the vertical asymptote is $x=-1$, $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x+1$.  Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, the other factor must also be linear.  Therefore, $q(x) = a(x+1)(x+b)$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.  We are given that $q(2) = 3$, so $3 = a(2+1)(2+b) = 3a(2+b)$.  This simplifies to $a(2+b)=1$.  We are also given that $p(2) = 1$, so $p(x) = cx + d$ for some constants $c$ and $d$, and $1 = 2c + d$.  Since the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$, the leading coefficients of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ must be equal.  Thus, $c = a$.  To summarize, we have the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\na(2+b) &= 1, \\\\\n2c+d &= 1, \\\\\nc &= a.\n\\end{align*}  Substituting $c=a$ into the second equation, we get $2a + d = 1$.  We can rewrite the first equation as $2a + ab = 1$.  Subtracting the equation $2a + d = 1$ from the equation $2a + ab = 1$, we get $ab - d = 0$, or $d = ab$.  Substituting this into the equation $2a + d = 1$, we get $2a + ab = 1$.  Substituting $ab = 1-2a$ into the equation $a(2+b)=1$, we get $a(2 + \\frac{1-2a}{a}) = 1$.  This simplifies to $a(3-2a) = 1$, or $3a - 2a^2 = 1$.  This can be rewritten as $2a^2 - 3a + 1 = 0$, which factors as $(2a-1)(a-1) = 0$.  This gives us $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $a = 1$.  If $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, then $d = ab = \\frac{1}{2}b$.  Substituting this into the equation $2a+d = 1$, we get $1 + \\frac{1}{2}b = 1$, so $b = 0$.  This gives us $q(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x+1)x$ and $p(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x$.  If $a = 1$, then $d = ab = b$.  Substituting this into the equation $2a+d = 1$, we get $2+b = 1$, so $b = -1$.  This gives us $q(x) = (x+1)(x-1) = x^2 - 1$ and $p(x) = x$.  We must choose the solution where $p(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}$, so $p(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x$ and $q(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x+1)x$.
