At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\mathcal P$ be a parabola, and let $V_1$ and $F_1$ be its vertex and focus, respectively. Let $A$ and $B$ be points on $\\mathcal P$ so that $\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ$. Let $\\mathcal Q$ be the locus of the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. It turns out that $\\mathcal Q$ is also a parabola, and let $V_2$ and $F_2$ denote its vertex and focus, respectively. Determine the ratio $\\frac{F_1F_2}{V_1V_2}$.",

        "ground_truth": "Since all parabolas are similar, we may assume that $\\mathcal P$ is the curve $y = x^2,$ so $V_1 = (0,0).$  Then, if $A = (a, a^2)$ and $B = (b, b^2)$, the slope of line $AV_1$ is $a,$ and the slope of line $BV_1$ is $b.$  Since $\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ,$ $ab = -1$.
