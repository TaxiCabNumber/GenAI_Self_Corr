At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S$ be the set of 10-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_9),$ where each entry is 0 or 1, so $S$ contains $2^{10}$ 10-tuples.  For each 10-tuple $s = (a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ in $S,$ let $p_s(x)$ be the polynomial of degree at most 9 such that\n\\[p_s(n) = a_n\\]for $0 \\le n \\le 9.$  For example, $p(x) = p_{(0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0)}(x)$ is the polynomial of degree at most 9 such that $p(0) = p(2) = p(3) = p(5) = p(7) = p(8) = p(9) = 0$ and $p(1) = p(4) = p(6) = 1.$\n\nFind\n\\[\\sum_{s \\in S} p_s(10).\\]",
