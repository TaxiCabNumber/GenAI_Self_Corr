Half of $-24$ is $-12$, and $(-12)^2=144$, so we add $144$ to both sides: \\begin{align*}\n4x^2-24x-25y^2+250y-489&=0\\\\\n4x^2-24x-25y^2+250y-489+144&=144\\\\\n4x^2-24x-25y^2+250y-345&=144.\n\\end{align*} To complete the square in $y$, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, square it, and add it to both sides of the equation.
