        "inference": "Let the roots of the equation be $r$, $r$, and $s$.  By Vieta's formulas, $2r + s = -8$, $r^2 + 2rs = -60$, and $2r^2 s = k$.  From the first equation, $s = -8 - 2r$.  Substituting into the second equation, we get\n\\[r^2 + 2r(-8 - 2r) = -60.\\]This simplifies to $5r^2 + 16r - 60 = 0$, which factors as $(5r - 12)(r + 5) = 0$.  Hence, $r = \\frac{12}{5}$ or $r = -5$.  Since $k$ is positive, $r = \\frac{12}{5}$.
