        "inference": "Since $f(x)$ is a monic quartic polynomial, we can write it in the form $f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$.  We are given that $f(-1) = -1$, $f(2) = -4$, $f(-3) = -9$, and $f(4) = -16$.  Substituting these values into the equation for $f(x)$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - a + b - c + d &= -1, \\\\\n16 + 8a + 4b + 2c + d &= -4, \\\\\n81 - 27a + 9b - 3c + d &= -9, \\\\\n256 + 64a + 16b + 4c + d &= -16.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, the second from the third, and the third from the fourth, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n15 + 9a + 3b + 3c &= -3, \\\\\n65 - 35a + 5b - 5c &= -5, \\\\\n175 - 37a + 7b + 7c &= -7.\n\\end{align*}\n\nDividing the second equation by 5 and the third equation by 7, we get\n\n\\begin{align*}\n15 + 9a + 3b + 3c &= -3, \\\\\n13 - 7a + b - c &= -1, \\\\\n25 - 5a + b + c &= -1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding the second and third equations, we get\n\n\\[18 - 12a + 2b = -2.\\]Then $9 - 6a + b = -1$, so $b = 6a - 10$.  Substituting into the equation $13 - 7a + b - c = -1$, we get $13 - 7a + 6a - 10 - c = -1$, so $c = -4$.  Then $15 + 9a + 3b + 3c = -3$ becomes $15 + 9a + 3(6a - 10) - 12 = -3$, so $a = 1$.  Then $b = 6a - 10 = -4$, and $d = -1 - 1 + 4 + 4 = 6$.  Hence, $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 6$, so $f(1) = 1 + 1 - 4 - 4 + 6 = \\boxed{0}$.",
