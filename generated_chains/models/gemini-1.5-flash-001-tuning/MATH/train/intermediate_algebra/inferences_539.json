Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x+1$ and $y+1$ are positive integers as well.  The pairs of positive integers whose product is 72 are $(1,72)$, $(2,36)$, $(3,24)$, $(4,18)$, $(6,12)$, $(8,9)$.\n\nWe can check that the only pair that satisfies $xy(x+y) = 880$ is $(x+1,y+1) = (8,9)$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $s=x+y$ and $p=xy$.

If $s = 16$ and $p = 55$, then \\[x^2+y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy = s^2 - 2p = 16^2 -2 \\cdot 55 =146.\\]If $s = 55$ and $p = 16$, then from $x+y=55$, we see that $p = xy \\ge 1 \\cdot 54 = 54$, which is a contradiction.
