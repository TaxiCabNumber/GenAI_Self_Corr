        "ground_truth": "There is exactly one term in the simplified expression for every monomial of the form $x^ay^bz^c$, where $a,b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers, $a$ is even, and $a+b+c=2006$.  There are 1004 even values of $a$ with $0\\leq a\\leq 2006$.  For each such value, $b$ can assume any of the $2007-a$ integer values between 0 and $2006-a$, inclusive, and the value of $c$ is then uniquely determined as $2006-a-b$.

Because the number of non-negative integer solutions of $a+b+c=k$ is $\\binom{k+2}{2}$, the sum is taken over $\\binom{2008}{2}$ terms, but those for which $b$ and $c$ have opposite parity have a sum of zero. If $b$ is odd and $c$ is even, then $a$ is odd, so $a=2A+1,b=2B+1,\n\\text{ and }c=2C$ for some non-negative integers $A,B,\\text{ and }C$. Therefore $2A+1+2B+1+2C=2006$, so $A+B+C=1002$. Because the last equation has $\\binom{1004}{2}$ non-negative integer solutions, there are $\\binom{1004}{2}$ terms for which $b$ is odd and $c$ is even. The number of terms for which $b$ is even and $c$ is odd is the same.
