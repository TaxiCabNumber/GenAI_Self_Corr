        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the equation $w^3+x^3+y^3=z^3$, $w^3$, $x^3$, $y^3$, and $z^3$ are distinct, consecutive positive perfect cubes listed in ascending order. What is the smallest possible value of $z$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are consecutive positive integers, we can replace them with $x-1$, $x$ , $x+1$, and $x+2$.  Substituting these into the equation, we have \\begin{align*}\n(x-1)^3+x^3+(x+1)^3&=(x+2)^3 \\implies \\\\\n(x^3-3x^2+3x-1)+x^3+(x^3+3x^2+3x+1)&=x^3+6x+12x^2+12 \\implies \\\\\n2x^3-6x^2-6x-8 &= 0 \\implies \\\\\nx^3-3x^2-3x-4 &= 0.\n\\end{align*} By the rational root theorem, the only possible rational solutions of the equation are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, and $\\pm4$.  Since the question suggests that there are positive integer solutions, we try dividing $x^3-3x^2-3x-4$ by $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ using synthetic division.  We find that $x^3-3x^2-3x-4=(x-4)(x^2+x+1)$.  The quadratic factor does not factor further since its discriminant is $1^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot1=-3$.  Therefore, $x=4$ is the only integer solution of the equation, which implies that $z=\\boxed{6}$."
