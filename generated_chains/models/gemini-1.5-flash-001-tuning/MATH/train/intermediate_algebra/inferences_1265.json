At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor some real numbers $a$ and $b$, the equation $9x^3 + 5ax^2 + 4bx + a = 0$ has three distinct positive roots. If the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 4, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Let the three roots be $r$, $s$, and $t$.  Then by Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = -\\frac{5a}{9}$, $rs + rt + st = \\frac{4b}{9}$, and $rst = -\\frac{a}{9}$.  We are given that $\\log_2 r + \\log_2 s + \\log_2 t = 4$, which means $\\log_2 (rst) = 4$.  Then $rst = 2^4 = 16$, so $-\\frac{a}{9} = 16$, and $a = \\boxed{-144}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-144}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the roots of the cubic be $r$, $s$, and $t$. We are given that $\\log_2 r + \\log_2 s + \\log_2 t = 4$. Using a property of logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log_2(rst)=4$, or $rst=2^4=16$. Notice that this is just the product of the roots of the given polynomial. The product of the roots is also equal to $-\\frac{a}{9}$. Thus, we have $-\\frac{a}{9}=16$ and $a=\\boxed{-144}$."
