Dividing the cubic term by $x+2,$ we then have \\[p(x) = (x-1)(x+2)(x^2+(2a-1)x+1).\\]Therefore, we want to find the probability that the roots of $x^2 + (2a-1)x + 1$ are all real. This occurs if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(2a-1)^2 - 4 \\ge 0,\\]or $(2a-1)^2 \\ge 4.$ Thus, either $2a-1 \\ge 2$ or $2a-1 \\le -2.$ The first inequality is equivalent to $a \\ge \\tfrac{3}{2},$ and the second is equivalent to $a \\le -\\tfrac{1}{2}.$ This shows that all values of $a$ except those in the interval $\\left(-\\tfrac12, \\tfrac32\\right)$ satisfy the condition. This interval has length $2,$ and the given interval $[-20, 18],$ which contains it completely, has length $18 - (-20) = 38,$ so the probability is \\[1 - \\frac{2}{38} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{19}}.\\]"
