At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor some integer $m$, the polynomial $x^3 - 2011x + m$ has the three integer roots $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Find $|a| + |b| + |c|.$",
        "inference": "By Vieta's formulas, $a+b+c=0$, $ab+ac+bc=-2011$, and $abc=-m$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, $abc$ is an integer, so $m$ is an integer.\n\nSince $a+b+c=0$, $c=-a-b$.  Substituting into $ab+ac+bc=-2011$, we get\n\\[ab + a(-a-b) + b(-a-b) = -2011.\\]This simplifies to $a^2 + ab + b^2 = 2011$.  We can write\n\\[a^2 + ab + b^2 = \\left( a + \\frac{b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{3b^2}{4}.\\]Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $\\frac{3b^2}{4}$ must be an integer.  This means $b$ must be even.  Let $b = 2k$, where $k$ is an integer.  Then\n\\[\\left( a + k \\right)^2 + 3k^2 = 2011.\\]Since $2011$ is prime, $3k^2$ must be less than 2011.  The largest perfect square less than $\\frac{2011}{3}$ is 672, so $k^2 \\le 224$.  The largest perfect square less than or equal to 224 is $15^2$, so $|k| \\le 15$.  We can check the values of $k$ from $-15$ to 15 to see if there are any solutions.\n\nFor example, if $k = 1$, then $\\left( a + 1 \\right)^2 + 3 = 2011$, so $\\left( a + 1 \\right)^2 = 2008$.  Since 2008 is not a perfect square, there is no solution for $k = 1$.\n\nWe can continue checking the values of $k$ in this way.  We find that the only solution is $k = -11$, which gives us $a = 23$ and $b = -22$.  Then $c = -a - b = -1$, so\n\\[|a| + |b| + |c| = 23 + 22 + 1 = \\boxed{46}.\\]",
        "ground_truth": "By Vieta's formulas, \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} a + b + c &= 0 \\\\ ab+bc+ac&=-2011. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]Since $a+b=-c,$ the second equation becomes $ab+(-c)c = -2011$, or \\[c^2 - ab= 2011.\\]At least two of $a, b, c$ must have the same sign; without loss of generality, let $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Furthermore, since we can negate all of $a, b, c$ and still satisfy the two above equations, assume that $c \\ge 0.$ (Note that we only want the sum $|a| + |b| + |c|$, which does not change if we swap or negate the variables.)\n\nNow, we have $ab \\ge 0,$ so $c^2 \\ge 2011$, giving $c \\ge 44.$ We also have \\[\\frac{c^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)^2 \\ge ab\\]by AM-GM, so $2011 = c^2 - ab \\ge 3c^2/4,$ giving $c \\le 51.$\n\nFinally, we have $(a-b)^2 = (a+b)^2 - 4ab = (-c)^2 - 4(c^2-2011) = 8044 - 3c^2$, which must be a perfect square.\n\nTesting $c = 44, 45, \\ldots, 51$, we find that $8044 - 3c^2$ is a perfect square only when $c = 49$. Therefore, $c = 49$, and so \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} a+b&= -c = -49, \\\\ ab &= c^2 - 2011 = 390. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]Thus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of $t^2 + 49t + 390 = 0$, which factors as $(t+10)(t+39) = 0$.
