Substituting $c = 1$ into the first and third equations, we get $9a - 3b = 9$ and $4a + 2b = 4$. Dividing the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get $3a - b = 3$ and $2a + b = 2$. Adding these equations, we get $5a = 5$, so $a = 1$. Substituting $a = 1$ into $3a - b = 3$, we get $b = 0$. Therefore, $p(x) = \\boxed{x^2 + 1}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{x^2 + 1}$.
