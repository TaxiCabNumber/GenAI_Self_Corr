        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution. The original equation is not in standard form for an ellipse. We need to manipulate it before we can find the distance between the foci. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe given equation is: \n  7x\u00b2 + 28y\u00b2 = 196\n\nTo get the standard form, we divide both sides by 196:\n  x\u00b2/28 + y\u00b2/7 = 1\n\nNow, we have:\n  a\u00b2 = 28 and b\u00b2 = 7\n\nTherefore:\n  c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 28 - 7 = 21\n\nThis gives us:\n  c = \u221a21\n\nThe distance between the foci is 2c, which is:\n  2\u221a21\n\nSo the final answer is:  \n  \n  \\\\boxed{2\\sqrt{21}}\n",
