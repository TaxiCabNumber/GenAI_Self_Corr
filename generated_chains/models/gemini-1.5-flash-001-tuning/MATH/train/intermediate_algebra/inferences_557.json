At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is reflected about the $x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $y=(f+g)(x)$?\n\n(A) a parabola tangent to the $x$-axis\n(B) a parabola not tangent to the $x$-axis\n(C) a horizontal line\n(D) a non-horizontal line\n(E) the graph of a cubic function",
