Last Tuesday, the exhibition collected $ \\$1950$ in admission fees from at least one adult and at least one child.  Of all the possible ratios of adults to children at the exhibition last Tuesday, which one is closest to $ 1$?",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the number of adults and $c$ be the number of children. We are given that $25a + 12c = 1950$. We want to find the ratio $a/c$ closest to 1.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as $25a = 1950 - 12c$.  Dividing both sides by $25c$, we get  \\[\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{1950 - 12c}{25c} = \\frac{78}{c} - \\frac{12}{25}.\\]We want to find the value of $c$ that makes $\\frac{78}{c} - \\frac{12}{25}$ as close to 1 as possible.  Since $\\frac{12}{25}$ is less than $\\frac{1}{2}$, we want to find the value of $c$ that makes $\\frac{78}{c}$ as close to $\\frac{3}{2}$ as possible.  This means we want $c$ to be as close to $78 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 52$ as possible.\n\nSince there must be at least one child, the closest possible value of $c$ is 52.  Then $a = \\frac{1950 - 12 \\cdot 52}{25} = 50$, and the ratio $a/c$ is $50/52$, which is very close to 1.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\frac{50}{52}}$. I hope it is correct.",
