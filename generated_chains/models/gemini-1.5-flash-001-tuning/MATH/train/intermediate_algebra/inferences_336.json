The Factor Theorem tells us that since $-1$ and $3$ are roots of the polynomial, $x+1$ and $x-3$ must be factors of the polynomial. To find which root occurs twice, we can divide $x^3-5x^2+3x+9$ by $x+1$ to get  $x^3-5x^2+3x+9 = (x+1)(x^2-6x+9)$.\n\nWe can factorise $x^2-6x+9$ as $(x-3)^2$ which means that the root $x=3$ has multiplicity 2.  Thus our roots are $\\boxed{-1,3,3}$."
