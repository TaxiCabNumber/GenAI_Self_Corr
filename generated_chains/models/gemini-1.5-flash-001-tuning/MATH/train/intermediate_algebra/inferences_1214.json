At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA function $f(x)$ is defined for all real numbers $x$. For all non-zero values $x$, we have\n\\[2f\\left(x\\right) + f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 5x + 4\\]\nLet $S$ denote the sum of all of the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = 2004$.
