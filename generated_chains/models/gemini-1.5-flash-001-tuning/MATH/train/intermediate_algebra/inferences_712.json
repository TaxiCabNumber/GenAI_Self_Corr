At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne of the asymptotes of a hyperbola has equation $y=3x.$ The foci of the hyperbola have the same $x-$coordinate, which is $5.$ Find the equation of the other asymptote of the hyperbola, giving your answer in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the foci have the same $x$-coordinate, the hyperbola is vertical. The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, so the center has $x$-coordinate $5$. Since the slope of one asymptote is $3$, the slope of the other asymptote is $-3$. Since the center has $x$-coordinate $5$, the equation of the other asymptote is of the form $y=-3x+b$.\n\nSince the center of the hyperbola lies on the other asymptote, we know that the point $(5,b)$ satisfies the equation $y=-3x+b$.  Substituting in these values, we find $b=-3(5)+b$, which simplifies to $b=-15$.  Therefore, the equation of the other asymptote is $y=-3x-15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{y=-3x-15}$.

        "ground_truth": "Because the foci both lie on the line $x=5$ and the center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment connecting the foci, the center must also lie on the line $x=5.$ However, we also know that the asymptotes of the hyperbola intersect at the center. Therefore, the center of the hyperbola lies on both the line $x=5$ and the line $y=3x,$ so its coordinates are $(5, 15).$\n\nBecause the hyperbola has a horizontal axis, the other asymptote must have slope $-3.$ Therefore, we can write a point-slope equation for the other asymptote: \\[y - 15 = -3(x - 5),\\]which is equivalent to $\\boxed{y = -3x + 30}.$"
