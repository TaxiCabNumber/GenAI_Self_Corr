Now, $0 \\cdot x + 4= \\boxed{4}$, so this is our answer.\n\nWe could also solve for $x$ from the information given.  The expression $x^2 - 2x - 8$ factors as $(x + 2)(x-4)$.  Thus $x$ must be equal to 4 or $-2$.  Since $x$ is positive, $x$ must equal 4.  Thus our expression is equal to \\[ 4^3 - 2 \\cdot 4^2 - 8 \\cdot 4 + 4 . \\]We can factor out a 4 to find that this is \\[\n4( 4^2 - 2 \\cdot 4 - 8 + 1) = 4( 16 - 8 - 8 +1) = 4 \\cdot 1 = 4, \\]as before.\n\n(Alternatively, since the problem statement implies that there is only one positive value of $x$ such that $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$, we could find the value 4 by trial and error, and then simplify as above.)"
