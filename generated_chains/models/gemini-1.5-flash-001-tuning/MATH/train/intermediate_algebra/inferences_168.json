        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution. The problem states that the **difference** between the first and fourth terms is 30, not the **common difference**. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe know that the difference between the first and fourth term is 30, so:\n  \n  (a + 3d) - a = 30 \n  \n  This simplifies to 3d = 30, which means d = 10.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the last three terms form a geometric progression:\n\n  (a + 2d) / (a + d) = (a + 3d) / (a + 2d)\n\nSubstituting d = 10, we get:\n\n  (a + 20) / (a + 10) = (a + 30) / (a + 20)\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:\n\n  a\u00b2 + 40a + 400 = a\u00b2 + 50a + 300\n\n  10a = 100\n\n  a = 10\n\nTherefore, the four terms are 10, 20, 30, and 40.\n\n**Final Answer:  \\\\boxed{10, 20, 30, 40}.** \n",
