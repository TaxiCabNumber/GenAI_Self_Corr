At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $-1 - 4\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 31 = 0\\]and that $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, compute $a.$",
        "inference": "Since the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, any irrational roots must come in conjugate pairs.  Therefore, $-1 + 4 \\sqrt{2}$ is also a root of the polynomial.\n\nThe sum of the roots of the polynomial is $-a,$ so\n\\[(-1 - 4 \\sqrt{2}) + (-1 + 4 \\sqrt{2}) + r = -a,\\]where $r$ is the third root.  This simplifies to $-2 + r = -a,$ so $r = -a + 2.$\n\nThe product of the roots of the polynomial is $-31,$ so\n\\[(-1 - 4 \\sqrt{2})(-1 + 4 \\sqrt{2})(-a + 2) = -31.\\]This simplifies to $15(-a + 2) = -31,$ so $a = \\boxed{\\frac{57}{15}}.$",
        "ground_truth": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $-1+4\\sqrt2$ must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-31,$ and the product of these two roots is $(-1-4\\sqrt2)(-1+4\\sqrt2) = -31,$ so the remaining root must be $\\frac{-31}{-31} = 1.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \\[a = -[1 + (-1-4\\sqrt2) + (-1+4\\sqrt2)] = \\boxed{1}.\\]"
