Find the sum of the lengths in cm of all the edges of this solid.\n",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the rectangular solid be $a$, $ar$, and $ar^2$.  We are given that $a \\cdot ar \\cdot ar^2 = 216$ and $2(a \\cdot ar + a \\cdot ar^2 + ar \\cdot ar^2) = 288$.  Simplifying these equations, we get $a^3 r^3 = 216$ and $2ar(a + ar + ar^2) = 288$.  From the first equation, we get $ar = 6$.  Substituting this into the second equation, we get $12(a + 6 + 6r) = 288$, or $a + 6 + 6r = 24$.  Then $a + 6r = 18$.  Since $ar = 6$, we can substitute $r = \\frac{6}{a}$ into this equation to get $a + 36/a = 18$.  Multiplying both sides by $a$ and rearranging, we get $a^2 - 18a + 36 = 0$.  Factoring, we get $(a - 6)(a - 6) = 0$, so $a = 6$.  Then $r = 1$, so the dimensions of the solid are $6$, $6$, and $6$.  The sum of the lengths of all the edges is $4(6 + 6 + 6) = \\boxed{72}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{72}$. I hope it is correct.",
