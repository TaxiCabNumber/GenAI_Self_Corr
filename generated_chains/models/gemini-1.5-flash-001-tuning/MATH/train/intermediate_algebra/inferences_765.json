(You might be tempted to think that $3-2\\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\\sqrt2$ are also a pair of radical conjugates, but the radical conjugate of $3-2\\sqrt2$ is $3+2\\sqrt2,$ while the radical conjugate of $-3-2\\sqrt2$ is $-3+2\\sqrt2.$ Therefore, each one of the numbers $3-2\\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\\sqrt2$ is actually the negation of the radical conjugate of the other one.)
