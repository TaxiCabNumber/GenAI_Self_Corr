        "inference": "You're absolutely right! There's an error in the logic. The problem is that we're trying to solve for the x-intercepts using the equations  $3(x-h)^2 + 671 = 0$ and $2(x-h)^2 + 1007 = 0$. However, these equations are for parabolas that open *upwards*,  not downwards.\n\nHere's how to correct the solution:\n\nSince the graphs have y-intercepts of 2013 and 2014, we know that $3j = 2013$ and $2k = 2014$. Solving, we find $j = 671$ and $k = 1007$.\n\nThe parabolas open downwards, so the coefficients of the squared term must be negative. Let's rewrite the equations as:\n\n*  $-3(x-h)^2 + 671 = 0$\n*  $-2(x-h)^2 + 1007 = 0$\n\nTo have two positive integer x-intercepts, the expressions inside the parentheses must be equal to some positive integers, say $a$ and $b$. So we have:\n\n* $-3a^2 + 671 = 0$ \n* $-2b^2 + 1007 = 0$\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n* $a^2 = \\frac{671}{3}$\n* $b^2 = \\frac{1007}{2}$\n\nSince 671 is not divisible by 3 and 1007 is not divisible by 2,  $a$ and $b$ cannot be integers. Therefore, there are no values of $h$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\text{There is no solution}}$. \n",
