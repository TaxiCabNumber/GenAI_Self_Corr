        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the complex number $z$ satisfying the equation $2z-3\\bar{z}=-2-30i$.  Note that $\\bar{z}$ denotes the conjugate of $z$.",
        "inference": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$.  Substituting into the given equation, we get \\[2(a+bi)-3(a-bi)=-2-30i.\\] Expanding, we have \\[2a+2bi-3a+3bi=-2-30i.\\] Combining like terms, we get \\[-a+5bi=-2-30i.\\]  Equating real and imaginary parts, we get $-a=-2$ and $5b=-30$.  Solving, we find $a=2$ and $b=-6$.  Therefore, $z=a+bi=\\boxed{2-6i}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2-6i}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $-3\\bar{z}=-3a+3ib$.  We now find that \\[2z-3\\bar{z} = (2a-3a) + (2b +3b)i. \\]So if $2z-3\\bar{z}=-2-30i$ then we must have $2a-3a=-2$ and $2b+3b=-30$.  This immediately gives us $a=2$ and $b=-6$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{2-6i}$."
