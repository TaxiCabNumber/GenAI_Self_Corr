        "inference": "You are absolutely right!  The solution has a logical flaw.  We can't just claim that the remainder when $(x + 1)^{2010}$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is $2^{2010}$. \n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\n**Using the Binomial Theorem**\n\nWe can expand $(x + 1)^{2010}$ using the Binomial Theorem:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x + 1)^{2010} &= \\binom{2010}{0} x^{2010} + \\binom{2010}{1} x^{2009} + \\binom{2010}{2} x^{2008} + \\dots + \\binom{2010}{2009} x + \\binom{2010}{2010} \\\\\n&= x^{2010} + 2010x^{2009} + \\binom{2010}{2} x^{2008} + \\dots + 2010x + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can repeatedly use the fact that $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $x^3 - 1$:\n\n* **Divide by $x^3 - 1$:**  Notice that $x^{2010} = x^3 \\cdot x^{2007}$ and $x^{2009} = x^3 \\cdot x^{2006}$.  So, we can replace these terms with multiples of $x^3 - 1$ and a remainder:\n   \\begin{align*}\n   x^{2010} &= x^3 \\cdot x^{2007} = (x^3 - 1) x^{2007} + x^{2007}, \\\\\n   x^{2009} &= x^3 \\cdot x^{2006} = (x^3 - 1) x^{2006} + x^{2006}.\n   \\end{align*} \n* **Repeat the process:** We can continue this process for all the terms of the form $x^{3k}$ and $x^{3k+1}$, where $k$ is an integer.  This will leave us with a sum of terms with powers of $x$ less than 3.\n\n**Finding the Remainder**\n\nAfter repeatedly replacing terms with multiples of $x^3 - 1$, we'll be left with an expression of the form:\n$$ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nTo find the remainder when $(x + 1)^{2010}$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$, we just need to find the remainder when $ax^2 + bx + c$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$.\n\nHowever, notice that  $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $x^3 - 1$, which implies it also divides any multiple of $x^3 - 1$.  Therefore, the remainder when $(x + 1)^{2010}$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is the same as the remainder when **1** (the constant term in the expansion) is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$.\n\n**The Final Answer**\n\nThe remainder when $(x + 1)^{2010}$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is $\\boxed{1}$. \n",
