Then, the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the two axes, which is $(3,-1)$.\n\nThe lengths of the major and minor axis are $6$ and $4$, respectively, so the distance between the foci is $\\sqrt{6^2-4^2} = 2\\sqrt{5}.$ It follows that each focus is $\\sqrt{5}$ away from the center, $(3,-1),$ along the major (horizontal) axis. Therefore, the focus with the larger $x$-coordinate must be $\\boxed{(3+\\sqrt{5},-1)}.$"
