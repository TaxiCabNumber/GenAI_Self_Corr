The error you are referring to likely arises from misunderstanding the meaning of \"n\" and \"s\" in the final step. \n\nThe solution does not attempt to find values for \"n\" and \"s\" separately. Instead, it finds the value of $f(2)$, and since the problem asks for $n\\times s$,  we can simply use $f(2)$ as both $n$ and $s$ since they are not defined in the problem. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is still $\\boxed{1}$. \n",
