At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx +c$ has the property that the mean of its zeros, the product of its zeros, and the sum of its coefficients are all equal. If the $y$-intercept of the graph of $y=\nP(x)$ is 2, what is $b$?",
