At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial\n$$g(x) = x^3 - x^2 - (m^2 + m) x + 2m^2 + 4m + 2$$is divisible by $x-4$ and all of its zeroes are integers. Find all possible values of $m$.",
        "inference": "Since $g(x)$ is divisible by $x-4$, we know that $g(4) = 0$.  Substituting $x=4$ into $g(x)$, we get\n\\[64 - 16 - 4(m^2 + m) + 2m^2 + 4m + 2 = 0.\\]This simplifies to $2m^2 = 50$, so $m^2 = 25$.  Hence, $m = \\boxed{5}$ or $m = \\boxed{-5}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since $g(x)$ is divisible by $x-4$, we have $g(4)=0$.

We check both possibilities.\n\nIf $m=5$, then $g(x)=x^3-x^2-30x+72=(x-4)(x^2+3x-18)=(x-4)(x+6)(x-3)$, so all zeroes are integers.\n\nIf $m=-5$, then $g(x)=x^3-x^2-20x+32=(x-4)(x^2+3x-8)$, but $x^2+3x-8$ does not have integer zeroes.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $m=\\boxed{5}$."
