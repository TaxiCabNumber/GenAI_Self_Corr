This tells us the hyperbola has a horizontal and vertical transverse axis, and its center is at the origin.\n\n2. **Find the values of a and b:**  Since the coefficients of the x and y terms are both 1, we have $a = b = 1$.\n\n3. **Find the value of c:**  The distance between the center and each focus is given by $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n4. **Calculate the distance between the foci:** The distance between the foci is $2c = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the foci of the hyperbola $xy=1$ is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$. \n",
