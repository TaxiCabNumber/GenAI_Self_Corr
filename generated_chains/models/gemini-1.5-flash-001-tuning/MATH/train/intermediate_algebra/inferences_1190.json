        "inference": "The solution is correct. The error lies in the interpretation of the problem. The solution correctly uses the fact that if a point $(a,b)$ lies on the curve, then its reflection across the line $y=x$, which is $(b,a)$, also lies on the curve. This leads to the equation $(p-r+s)(a-b)=0$, which holds for all points $(a,b)$ on the curve.  Therefore, $p-r+s=0$ and hence $p+s=r$.  \n\nThe final solution is: \\\\boxed{$p+s=r$} \n",
