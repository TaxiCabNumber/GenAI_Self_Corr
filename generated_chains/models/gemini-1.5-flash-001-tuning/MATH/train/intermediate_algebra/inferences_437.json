        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Horizontal Stretch:** A horizontal stretch by a factor of 2 means the graph is stretched away from the y-axis, making the x-values twice as large. This is represented by replacing $x$ with $x/2$ in the function.\n* **Translation Down:** A translation down by 4 units means the entire graph is shifted 4 units downwards. This is represented by subtracting 4 from the function.\n\nTherefore, if $g(x)$ is obtained from $f(x)$ by these transformations, the equation of $g(x)$ is:\n\n$$g(x) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) - 4$$\n\nThis matches the form  $g(x) = af(bx) + c$, where $a = 1$, $b = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $c = -4$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{(1, \\frac{1}{2}, -4)}$** \n",
