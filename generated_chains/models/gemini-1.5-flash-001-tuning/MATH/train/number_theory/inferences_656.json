        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There is a critical error in the solution. The problem is that the original equation $rs=2a$ does not necessarily imply that $r+s=a$.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\nLet the quadratic be $x^2 + bx + 2a = 0$.  By Vieta's formulas, we know $r+s = -b$ and $rs = 2a$.  Since $r$ and $s$ are integers, $rs$ is even.  This means that at least one of $r$ and $s$ is even.\n\nWe can use the difference of squares factorization: $(r-s)^2 = r^2 - 2rs + s^2 = (r+s)^2 - 4rs = b^2 - 8a$. Since $r$ and $s$ are integers, $(r-s)^2$ is also an integer.  This means $b^2 - 8a$ must be a perfect square.\n\nLet's consider some possibilities for $b^2 - 8a$:\n\n* **If $b^2 - 8a = 0$,** then $b^2 = 8a$.  Since 8 is not a perfect square, $a$ cannot be a perfect square, and $b$ must be even.\n* **If $b^2 - 8a = 1$,** then $b^2 = 8a + 1$.  This has solutions in integers, for example, $a = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n* **If $b^2 - 8a = 4$,** then $b^2 = 8a + 4$.  This also has solutions in integers, for example, $a = 1$ and $b = 2$.\n\nWe can continue in this way, finding more values for $a$ and $b$.  However, since there are infinitely many perfect squares, there are infinitely many possible values of $a$ and $b$.  This makes it impossible to find a finite sum of all possible values of $a$.\n\n**Therefore, the problem has no well-defined solution.** \n",
