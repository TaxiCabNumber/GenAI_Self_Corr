At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlicia has $n$ candies, where $n$ is a positive integer with three digits. If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$. If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",

This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits."
