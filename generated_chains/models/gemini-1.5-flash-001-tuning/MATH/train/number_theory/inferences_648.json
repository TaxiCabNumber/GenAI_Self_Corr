        "inference": "We can write $A_n$ as $a(10^n - 1)/9$, $B_n$ as $b(10^n - 1)/9$, and $C_n$ as $c(10^{2n} - 1)/9$.  Thus, we want to solve the equation\n\\[c(10^{2n} - 1)/9 - b(10^n - 1)/9 = a^2(10^n - 1)^2/81.\\]Multiplying both sides by 81, we get\n\\[9c(10^{2n} - 1) - 9b(10^n - 1) = a^2(10^n - 1)^2.\\]We can rewrite this as\n\\[9c(10^n + 1)(10^n - 1) - 9b(10^n - 1) = a^2(10^n - 1)^2.\\]Dividing both sides by $10^n - 1$, we get\n\\[9c(10^n + 1) - 9b = a^2(10^n - 1).\\]This simplifies to\n\\[9c \\cdot 10^n + 9c - 9b = a^2 \\cdot 10^n - a^2.\\]Then\n\\[(9c - a^2) \\cdot 10^n = a^2 - 9c + 9b.\\]Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, the right-hand side is an integer.  Therefore, the left-hand side must also be an integer.  This means $9c - a^2$ must be divisible by 10.  The only way this can happen is if $a^2$ ends in a 9.  The only digit whose square ends in a 9 is 3.  Thus, $a = 3$.\n\nNow our equation becomes\n\\[(9c - 9) \\cdot 10^n = 9 - 9c + 9b.\\]This simplifies to\n\\[c \\cdot 10^n - 1 = 1 - c + b.\\]Then\n\\[c \\cdot 10^n = 2 - c + b.\\]Since $c$ is a digit, the right-hand side is an integer.  Therefore, the left-hand side must also be an integer.  This means $2 - c + b$ must be divisible by 10.  The only way this can happen is if $b - c$ ends in an 8.  The only digits $b$ and $c$ for which $b - c$ ends in an 8 are $b = 9$ and $c = 1$.\n\nWe can check that these values work.
