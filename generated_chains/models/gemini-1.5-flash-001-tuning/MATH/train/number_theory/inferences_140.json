I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a_n$ be the integer obtained by writing all the integers from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. For example, $a_3 = 123$ and $a_{11} = 1234567891011$.

Note that $a_{44}$ consists of all the digits from 1 to 9, the digit 0, and the digit 1 repeated 4 times. Therefore, the sum of the digits of $a_{44}$ is $45 + 4 = 49$.  Since the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9, $a_{44} \\equiv 49 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{9}$. Also, since $a_{44}$ is even, $a_{44} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $a_{44} \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{18}$.  Since $45 = 5 \\cdot 9$, to find the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45, it suffices to find the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 5.

        "ground_truth": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does.

This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\\boxed{9}$."
