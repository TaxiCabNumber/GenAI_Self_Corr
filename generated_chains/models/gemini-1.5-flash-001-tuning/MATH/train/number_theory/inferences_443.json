        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nJenny starts with 8 * 42 = 336 pages. \nThese pages contain 336 * 6 = 2016 stamps. \nWith 4 complete books at 42 pages per book, Jenny uses up 4 * 42 = 168 pages. \nShe fills these with 168 * 10 = 1680 stamps. \nThe first 33 pages of her fifth book contain 33 * 10 = 330 stamps. \nThis means that the final page contains 2016 - 1680 - 330 = 6 stamps. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$."
