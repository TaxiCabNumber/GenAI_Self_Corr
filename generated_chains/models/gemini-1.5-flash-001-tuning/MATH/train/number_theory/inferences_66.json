At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the number of even digits in the base-7 representation of $403_{10}$.",
        "inference": "First, we convert $403_{10}$ to base-7.  We find that $403 = 7^3 \\cdot 1 + 7^2 \\cdot 1 + 7^0 \\cdot 3$, so $403_{10} = 113_7$.  There is $\\boxed{1}$ even digit in the base-7 representation of $403_{10}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by converting $403_{10}$ into base-7. Since $7^3=343$ is the largest power of 7 that is less than 403, and it can go into the given number once, the coefficient of the $7^3$ term will be 1. From here, we are left with a remainder of $403-343=60$. The largest power of 7 less than this number is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 that is less than 60 is $1\\cdot49=49$ itself. This leaves us with $60-49=11$, which we can express as $1\\cdot7^1+4\\cdot7^0$. So, we find that $403_{10}=1\\cdot7^3+1\\cdot7^2+1\\cdot{7^1}+4\\cdot7^0=1114_7$, which only has $\\boxed{1}$ even digit."
