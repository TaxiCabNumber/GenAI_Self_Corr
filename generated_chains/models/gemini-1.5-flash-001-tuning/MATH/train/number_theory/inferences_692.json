I hope it is correct.'\nAn abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",

        "ground_truth": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$.
