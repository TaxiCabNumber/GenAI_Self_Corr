        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEd and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n",
        "inference": "Let $b$ be Ed and Sue's biking rate, $j$ be their jogging rate, and $s$ be their swimming rate.  We are given that $2b+3j+4s=74$ and $4b+2j+3s=91$.  Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get $4b+6j+8s=148$.  Subtracting the second equation from this, we get $4j+5s=57$.  Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get $12b+6j+9s=273$.  Subtracting the first equation multiplied by 6, we get $8b+5s=129$.  Multiplying $4j+5s=57$ by 8, we get $32j+40s=456$.  Multiplying $8b+5s=129$ by 5, we get $40b+25s=645$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $40b-32j=189$.  Dividing by 8, we get $5b-4j=\\frac{189}{8}$.  Multiplying $4j+5s=57$ by 5, we get $20j+25s=285$.  Multiplying $8b+5s=129$ by 4, we get $32b+20s=516$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $32b-20j=231$.  Dividing by 4, we get $8b-5j=\\frac{231}{4}$.  Multiplying $5b-4j=\\frac{189}{8}$ by 5, we get $25b-20j=\\frac{945}{8}$.  Subtracting $8b-5j=\\frac{231}{4}$ from this, we get $17b=\\frac{463}{8}$, so $b=17$.  Substituting into $5b-4j=\\frac{189}{8}$, we get $85-4j=\\frac{189}{8}$, so $j=11$.  Substituting into $4b+2j+3s=91$, we get $68+22+3s=91$, so $s=7$.  Therefore, the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates is $17^2+11^2+7^2=\\boxed{439}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$."
