At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward. For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes. What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?",
