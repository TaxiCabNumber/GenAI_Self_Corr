I hope it is correct.'\nThe harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $6^{20}$?\n",
        "inference": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is $\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}=\\frac{2xy}{x+y}$.  We want this to equal $6^{20}$, so\n\\[\\frac{2xy}{x+y}=6^{20}.\\]Then $2xy=6^{20}(x+y)$.  Rearranging, we get\n\\[6^{20}x+6^{20}y-2xy=0.\\]We can factor the left side as\n\\[(6^{20}-2y)x+6^{20}y=0.\\]Solving for $x$, we find\n\\[x=\\frac{6^{20}y}{2y-6^{20}}.\\]Since $x$ is an integer, $2y-6^{20}$ must divide $6^{20}y$.  In other words, $2y-6^{20}$ must divide $6^{20}(2y-6^{20})+6^{40}=6^{40}$.\n\nSince $y$ is an integer, $2y-6^{20}$ is an integer.  Also, $2y-6^{20}<2y<2y+6^{20}$.  Thus, $2y-6^{20}$ is a divisor of $6^{40}$ that is less than $2y+6^{20}$.\n\nConversely, if $d$ is a divisor of $6^{40}$ and $d<2y+6^{20}$, then\n\\[y=\\frac{d+6^{20}}{2}.\\]Since $d$ divides $6^{40}$, $d+6^{20}$ is even, so $y$ is an integer.  Also,\n\\[x=\\frac{6^{20}y}{2y-6^{20}}=\\frac{6^{20}(d+6^{20})}{2(d+6^{20})-2\\cdot 6^{20}}=\\frac{6^{20}(d+6^{20})}{2d}=\\frac{6^{20}}{2}+\\frac{3^{40}}{d}.\\]Since $d$ divides $6^{40}$, $x$ is an integer.\n\nThus, the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ is equal to the number of divisors of $6^{40}$ that are less than $2y+6^{20}$.  Since $6^{40}=2^{40}\\cdot 3^{40}$, the number of divisors of $6^{40}$ is $(40+1)(40+1)=1681$.  The number of divisors of $6^{40}$ that are greater than or equal to $2y+6^{20}$ is equal to the number of divisors of $6^{40}$ that are greater than or equal to $2\\cdot 6^{20}+6^{20}=3\\cdot 6^{20}$.  This is the same as the number of divisors of $6^{20}$ that are greater than or equal to $3$, which is $\\frac{20+1}{2}-1=10$.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ is $1681-10=\\boxed{1671}$.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}2} = \\frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\\frac{1599-1}{2}= \\boxed{799}$."
