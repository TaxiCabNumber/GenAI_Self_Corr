I hope it is correct.'\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?",
        "inference": "We want to find all $(x,y)$ that satisfy both congruences.  Setting the right sides of the congruences equal, we get \\[5x+2\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.\\]Subtracting $5x$ and $12$ from both sides, we get \\[-10 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}.\\]Since $-10 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{16}$, we have \\[6 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}.\\]Dividing both sides by 6 (which is relatively prime to 16), we get \\[1 \\equiv x \\pmod{16}.\\]Thus, $x=1$ is the only solution.  Substituting into either congruence, we find that $y=7$.  Therefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points in common is $\\boxed{1}$. \n",

        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that there is only one solution for $x$. The congruence $1 \\equiv x \\pmod{16}$ actually represents an infinite number of solutions for $x$, given by $x = 1 + 16k$ where $k$ is any integer. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe are given the congruences:\n\n* $5x + 2 \\equiv y \\pmod{16}$\n* $11x + 12 \\equiv y \\pmod{16}$\n\nSetting the right sides equal, we get:\n\n$5x + 2 \\equiv 11x + 12 \\pmod{16}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$-10 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}$\n\nSince $-10 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{16}$, we have:\n\n$6 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}$\n\nDividing both sides by 6 (which is relatively prime to 16), we get:\n\n$1 \\equiv x \\pmod{16}$\n\nThis means $x$ can be expressed as $x = 1 + 16k$ where $k$ is any integer.\n\nSubstituting this back into either original congruence, we can solve for $y$:\n\nLet's use the first congruence:\n\n$5(1 + 16k) + 2 \\equiv y \\pmod{16}$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$7 + 80k \\equiv y \\pmod{16}$\n\nSince $80k$ is always a multiple of 16, we have:\n\n$y \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$\n\nTherefore, the solutions for $(x,y)$ are of the form $(1 + 16k, 7)$, where $k$ is any integer.  \n\nTo find the sum of the $x$-coordinates, we need to consider multiple values of $k$.  However, since the question asks for the sum of the $x$-coordinates, we can just consider the solutions where $k = 0$ and $k = 1$.  \n\nFor $k = 0$, we have $x = 1$.\n\nFor $k = 1$, we have $x = 17$.\n\nThe sum of these $x$-coordinates is $1 + 17 = 18$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points in common is $\\boxed{18}$. \n",
