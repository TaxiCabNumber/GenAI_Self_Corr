At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A$ be the set of all numbers which can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be $n$, $n+1$, and $n+2$.  Their sum is $n+(n+1)+(n+2)=3n+3=3(n+1)$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, $n+1$ is also a positive integer, so every number in $A$ is a multiple of 3.  In particular, 3 is in $A$.  Since every number in $A$ is a multiple of 3 and 3 is the smallest positive multiple of 3, the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ is $\\boxed{3}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
