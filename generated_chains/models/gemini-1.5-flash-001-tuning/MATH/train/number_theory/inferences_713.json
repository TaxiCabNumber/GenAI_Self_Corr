At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular fortune cookie lists four two-digit positive integers as your lucky numbers. The first three are 57, 13, and 72, but you got sauce on the last one and can't read it. If the sum of the digits of all four numbers equals $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the sum of all four numbers, what is the smallest possibility for the fourth lucky number?",
        "inference": "Let the missing two-digit number be $ab$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit.  We are given that $5+7+1+3+7+2+a+b = \\frac{1}{5}(57+13+72+10a+b)$.  Simplifying, we get $25+a+b = \\frac{1}{5}(142+10a+b)$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 gives $125+5a+5b = 142+10a+b$.  Combining like terms, we get $4a-4b = -17$.  Dividing both sides by 4 gives $a-b = -\\frac{17}{4}$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, the smallest possible value for $a$ is 1, which means $b = 1 + \\frac{17}{4} = \\frac{21}{4}$.  Since $b$ must be an integer, we increase $a$ to 2, which means $b = 2 + \\frac{17}{4} = \\frac{25}{4}$.  Increasing $a$ again to 3 gives $b = 3 + \\frac{17}{4} = \\frac{29}{4}$.  Finally, increasing $a$ to 4 gives $b = 4 + \\frac{17}{4} = \\frac{33}{4}$.  Since $b$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $ab$ is $46$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{46}$.
