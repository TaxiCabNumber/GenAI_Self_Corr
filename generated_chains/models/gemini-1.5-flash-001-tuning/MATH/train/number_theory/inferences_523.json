At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",

        "ground_truth": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$."
