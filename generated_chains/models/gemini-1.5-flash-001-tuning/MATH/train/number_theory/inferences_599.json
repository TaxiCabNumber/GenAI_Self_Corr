I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right. What is the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$?",
        "inference": "Let the four consecutive integers be $a$, $a-1$, $a-2$, and $a-3$. Then, we can write $n$ as:\n\n$$n = 1000a + 100(a-1) + 10(a-2) + (a-3)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$n = 1111a - 123$$\n\nWe want to find the remainders when $n$ is divided by 37.  Let's look at the remainders of multiples of 1111 when divided by 37:\n\n* $1111 \\div 37 = 30$  (remainder 1)\n\nSo, we can write:\n\n$$1111a = 37(30a) + a$$\n\nThis means:\n\n$$n = 37(30a) + a - 123$$\n\nWe want to find the remainders when $n$ is divided by 37.  Since $37(30a)$ is divisible by 37, the remainder when $n$ is divided by 37 is the same as the remainder when $a-123$ is divided by 37.\n\nTo find the possible remainders, we need to consider the possible values of $a$. Since $a$ is the largest of the four consecutive digits, the largest possible value of $a$ is 9.  Let's try the possible values of $a$:\n\n* If $a = 9$, then $a - 123 = -114$ which has a remainder of 15 when divided by 37.\n* If $a = 8$, then $a - 123 = -115$ which has a remainder of 22 when divided by 37.\n* If $a = 7$, then $a - 123 = -116$ which has a remainder of 29 when divided by 37.\n* If $a = 6$, then $a - 123 = -117$ which has a remainder of 36 when divided by 37.\n\nTherefore, the possible remainders are 15, 22, 29, and 36. The sum of these remainders is $15 + 22 + 29 + 36 = \\boxed{102}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
