At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction $\\frac{1}{129}$?",

        "ground_truth": "If we multiply this fraction by 10, we do not change any of the digits; we simply shift all the digits one place to the left. Therefore, if we multiply the fraction by a sufficiently large power of 10, then the first digit obtained when dividing by 129 will be the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$. Observing that $100 < 129 < 1000$, we compute $\\frac{1000}{129}=7 \\frac{97}{129}$. So the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of $\\frac{1}{129}$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
