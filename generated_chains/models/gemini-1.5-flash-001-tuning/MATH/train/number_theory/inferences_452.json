At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the reciprocal of the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$?",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{2}$.  Then $10x = 2.\\overline{2}$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $9x = 2$, so $x = \\frac{2}{9}$.  The reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{9}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",

The reciprocal is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\\overline{2}$. That means $10x=2.\\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\\overline{2}-.\\overline{2}=2$. So $x=\\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\\frac92$."
