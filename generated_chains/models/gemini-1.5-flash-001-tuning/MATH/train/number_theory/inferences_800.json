        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA four-digit integer $m$ and the four-digit integer obtained by reversing the order of the digits of $m$ are both divisible by 45. If $m$ is divisible by 7, what is the greatest possible value of $m$?",
        "inference": "Let $m = abcd$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are digits. Then the reverse of $m$ is $dcba$.\n\nSince $m$ is divisible by 45, it is divisible by both 5 and 9.  Since $m$ is divisible by 5, $d$ must be 0 or 5.  Since $m$ is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9: $a+b+c+d$ is divisible by 9.\n\nSimilarly, $dcba$ is divisible by 9, so $d+c+b+a$ is divisible by 9.  Since $a+b+c+d$ and $d+c+b+a$ are both divisible by 9, their difference is also divisible by 9: $(a+b+c+d) - (d+c+b+a) = 2(a-d)$ is divisible by 9.  Since 2 is not divisible by 9, $a-d$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nSince $d$ is 0 or 5, and $a-d$ is divisible by 9, the only possibility is $d = 5$ and $a = 4$.\n\nNow we have $m = 4bc5$.  Since $m$ is divisible by 7, we know that $4000 + 100b + 10c + 5$ is divisible by 7.  This simplifies to $100b + 10c + 5$ being divisible by 7.  Reducing modulo 7, we get $2b + 3c + 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nWe can try different values of $b$ and $c$ to see which ones work.  Since $b$ and $c$ are digits, we only need to try a few values.  We find that $b = 9$ and $c = 3$ work, since $2(9) + 3(3) + 5 = 32$ is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $m$ is $\\boxed{4935}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4935}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integer obtained by reversing the digits of $m$ be $n$. $m$ and $n$ are both divisible by $45$, which means that they are both divisible by $5$.  Thus, they both have units digits of $5$ or $0$.  If one has a units digit of $0$, the other will have a leading digit of $0$, which cannot be.  So both end in $5$; reversing them shows that both start with $5$ as well.  Since $m$ is divisible by $45$ and by $7$, it is divisible by $7(45)=315$.  There are four multiples of $315$ between $5000$ and $6000$: $5040$, $5355$, $5670$, and $5985$. $5985$ is the largest, and it is easy to see that it and its reversal, $5895$, meet all requirements.  So $\\boxed{5985}$ is the answer."
