At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.

So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future."
