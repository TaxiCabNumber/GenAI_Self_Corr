At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four consecutive digits $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are used to form the four-digit numbers $abcd$ and $dcba$. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form $abcd+dcba$?",

To see that no higher number must divide it, if we take $a = 1$ and $a=2$, we get the numbers $5555$ and $7777$, whose greatest common factor is indeed $1111$."
