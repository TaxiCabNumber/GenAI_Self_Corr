        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?",
        "inference": "A three-digit palindrome has the form $ABA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits.  Since $ABA$ is a perfect square, it must be the square of a two-digit number.  The two-digit numbers that have squares between 100 and 999 are 10, 11, 12, $\\dots$, 31.  We can check these numbers one by one to see which ones have squares that are palindromes.  We find that the only such number is 11, whose square is 121.  Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ three-digit perfect square that is a palindrome.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes."
