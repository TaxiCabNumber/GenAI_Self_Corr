        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it doesn't take into account the fact that $k$ is the floor of the square root of $n$. The solution incorrectly combines inequalities that are only valid within their respective ranges.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nSince $k = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor$, we know that $k^2 \\le n < (k+1)^2$.  We are given that $\\frac{n+1000}{70} = k$.  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get $n+1000 = 70k$.\n\nSubstituting the inequality $k^2 \\le n < (k+1)^2$ into this equation, we get\n\\[k^2 + 1000 \\le 70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000.\\]The left inequality becomes $k^2 - 70k + 1000 \\le 0$, which factors as $(k-20)(k-50) \\le 0$.  This means $20 \\le k \\le 50$.\n\nThe right inequality becomes $k^2 - 68k + 1000 > 0$, which factors as $(k-20)(k-50) > 0$.  This means $k < 20$ or $k > 50$.\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the only possible values of $k$ are 20, 21, $\\dots$, 50.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{31}$ possible values of $n$. \n",
