At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "First, we find the prime factorization of 504: $504=2^3\\cdot3^2\\cdot7$.  The positive even factors of 504 are of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot7^c$, where $1\\le a\\le3$, $0\\le b\\le2$, and $0\\le c\\le1$.  To find the sum of all these factors, we use the following trick: $(1+2+2^2+2^3)(1+3+3^2)(1+7)$.  This is because when we expand this product, each term is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot7^c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ range over the desired values.  Therefore, the sum of the positive even factors of 504 is $(1+2+2^2+2^3)(1+3+3^2)(1+7)=15\\cdot13\\cdot8=\\boxed{1560}$.  I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$."
