        "ground_truth": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$."
