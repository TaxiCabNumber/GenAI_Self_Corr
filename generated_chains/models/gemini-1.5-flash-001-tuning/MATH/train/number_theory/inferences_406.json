        "inference": "Solution: \nSince $a$ is a multiple of 456, we can write $a = 456k$ for some integer $k$. Then, \n\\begin{align*}\n3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57 &= 3(456k)^3 + (456k)^2 + 4(456k) + 57 \\\\\n&= 456(3 \\cdot 456^2 k^3 + 456k^2 + 4k) + 57.\n\\end{align*}This shows that $3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57$ leaves a remainder of 57 when divided by $a$. Since the greatest common divisor of $a$ and 57 divides both $a$ and 57, it must also divide their difference, which is 57. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $3a^3 + a^2 + 4a + 57$ and $a$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and 57. Since $a$ is a multiple of 456, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and 57 is the same as the greatest common divisor of 456 and 57, which is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
