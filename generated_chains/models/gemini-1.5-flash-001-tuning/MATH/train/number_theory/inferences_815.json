At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind all 6-digit multiples of 22 of the form $5d5,\\!22e$ where $d$ and $e$ are digits. What is the maximum value of $d$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \n\nSince $5d5,\\!22e$ is a multiple of 22, it must be a multiple of 2 and 11. \n\nThe number is even, so it is a multiple of 2. To be a multiple of 11, the difference of the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places must be either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nIn this case, we have $5+d+2+e-(5+2+2)=d+e$.  We want to maximize $d$, so we want to minimize $e$.  The smallest possible value of $e$ is 0.  Therefore, $d+e=d+0=d$ must be a multiple of 11.\n\nThe largest digit $d$ that is a multiple of 11 is 0.  Therefore, the maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$.

        "ground_truth": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the digits must be single digits.  Since the number is a multiple of 22, it can be a larger number.  Therefore, we can take $d=22$, and $e=0$, and $522,220$ is a multiple of 22.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}$.",
