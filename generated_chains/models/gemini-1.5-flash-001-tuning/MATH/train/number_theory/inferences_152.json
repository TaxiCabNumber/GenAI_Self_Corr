        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor all positive integers $n$, the $n$th triangular number $T_n$ is defined as $T_n = 1+2+3+ \\cdots + n$. What is the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nWe know that $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Therefore, $4T_n = 2n(n+1)$. We can factor out a 2 from this expression, giving us $4T_n = 2(n)(n+1)$. Since $n$ and $n+1$ are consecutive integers, one of them must be even. Therefore, $2n(n+1)$ is divisible by 4. \n\nNow, consider the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$. If $n-1$ is divisible by 4, then it is also divisible by 2. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$ is at least 4.\n\nTo find the greatest possible value, we need to find a value of $n$ for which $n-1$ is divisible by 4, and the greatest common divisor of $2n(n+1)$ and $n-1$ is exactly 4. Let $n = 5$. Then $n-1 = 4$ and $2n(n+1) = 60$. The greatest common divisor of 60 and 4 is 4. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of $4T_n$ and $n-1$ is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "By the arithmetic series formula, $T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, so $4T_n = 2n(n+1) = 2n^2 + 2n$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n, n-1) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(2n^2 + 2n - (n-1) \\times 2n, n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n, n - 1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4n - 4(n-1) , n-1) \\\\ &= \\text{gcd}\\,(4, n -1) \\le \\boxed{4}.\\end{align*} For example, this is true for $n = 5$."
