        "inference": "The solution provided has a few errors and misinterpretations of the problem.  Here's a corrected solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest possible value of $m+n$ given that $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ and $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$.  We need to carefully analyze the conditions and find a way to minimize $m+n$.\n\n**Correcting the Errors:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:** The statement \"Since $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, neither $m+n$ nor $m$ nor $n$ can be divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7\" is incorrect.  It's only true that  $m+n$ cannot be divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.  Both $m$ and $n$ can be divisible by primes other than 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n2. **Minimizing:**  The assumption that we should take $m=p$ and $n=1$ to minimize $m+n$ is not necessarily true. We need to explore other possibilities.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze the condition $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$.  This implies that for every prime factor $p$ of $n$, $p$ must also be a prime factor of $m$, and the power of $p$ in the prime factorization of $m$ must be greater than or equal to the power of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = 1$, we know $m+n$ is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, $m$ and $n$ can be divisible by other primes.\n\nTo minimize $m+n$, let's try to make $m$ and $n$ as small as possible. We can achieve this by taking $n=1$ and letting $m$ be the smallest prime number greater than 7.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $m + n$ is $11 + 1 = \\boxed{12}$. \n",
