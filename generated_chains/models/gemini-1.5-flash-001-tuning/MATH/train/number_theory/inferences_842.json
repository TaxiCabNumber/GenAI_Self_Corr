At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Solution: \nFirst, we subtract 1 from both sides of the congruence to get $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$.  Since 8 and 12 share a common factor of 4, we can divide both sides by 4 to get $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.  To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3, which is 2, to get $x \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$.  Thus, $a + m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $8x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{12}$. Add 12 to the right-hand side to get $8x \\equiv 16 \\pmod{12}$. Now divide both sides by 8, remembering to divide 12 by the greatest common factor of 12 and 8, thus obtaining $x \\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. This gives $a+m = 2 + 3 = \\boxed{5}$. Here we have used the fact that $ad \\equiv bd\\pmod{m}$ if and only if $a\\equiv b \\pmod{m/\\text{gcd}(m,d)}$, for integers $m\\geq 2$ and $a$, $b$, and $d$."
