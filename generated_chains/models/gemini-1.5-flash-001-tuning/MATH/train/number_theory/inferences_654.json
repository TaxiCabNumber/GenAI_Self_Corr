At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S(n)$ equal the sum of the digits of positive integer $n$. For example, $S(1507) = 13$. For a particular positive integer $n$, $S(n) = 1274$. Which of the following could be the value of $S(n+1)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1265$\n",
