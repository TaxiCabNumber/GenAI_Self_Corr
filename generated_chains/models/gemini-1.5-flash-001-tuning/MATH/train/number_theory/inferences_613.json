        "inference": "The sum of $j$ consecutive odd integers starting with $a$ is $j(a + j - 1)$.  Thus, $N = j(a + j - 1)$ for some positive integer $a$ and some $j \\ge 1$.  If $N$ is divisible by 5, then $j$ must be divisible by 5, since $a + j - 1$ is even.  Conversely, if $j$ is divisible by 5, then $N$ is divisible by 5.\n\nSince $N$ is divisible by 5 if and only if $j$ is divisible by 5, we want to count the number of values of $N$ for which there are exactly 5 possible values of $j \\ge 1$ such that $N = j(a + j - 1)$.\n\nLet $j = 5k$.  Then $N = 5k(a + 5k - 1)$.  For any fixed value of $k$, we can write the values of $N$ as\n\\[N = 5k(a + 5k - 1), \\ 5k(a + 5k + 3), \\ 5k(a + 5k + 7), \\ 5k(a + 5k + 11), \\ 5k(a + 5k + 15).\\]In other words, the values of $N$ for a fixed value of $k$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $20k$.  Furthermore, if $k = 1$, then these five values are all less than 1000, and if $k = 2$, then these five values are all greater than 1000.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ integers $N$ less than 1000 that can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers for exactly 5 values of $j$.",

Thus, $j$ is a factor of $N$.\nSince $n\\geq 0$, it follows that $2n+j \\geq j$ and $j\\leq \\sqrt{N}$.\nSince there are exactly $5$ values of $j$ that satisfy the equation, there must be either $9$ or $10$ factors of $N$.
