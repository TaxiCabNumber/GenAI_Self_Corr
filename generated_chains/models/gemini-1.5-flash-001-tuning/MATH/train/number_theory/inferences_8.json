        "inference": "Solution:  Since $A$ and $B$ are both prime, one of them must be even, and the other must be odd. Since 2 is the only even prime number, we must have either $A = 2$ or $B = 2.$ If $A = 2,$ then $A-B$ and $A+B$ are consecutive odd integers.  Since $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both prime, the only possibility is $A-B = 3$ and $A+B = 5.$  This gives us $B = 1,$ which is not prime. So we must have $B = 2.$  Then, $A-B = A-2$ and $A+B = A+2.$  Since $A$ is prime, the only possibility is $A-2 = 3$ and $A+2 = 7,$ which gives us $A = 5.$  So, the sum of the four primes is $2+5+3+7 = \\boxed{17}.$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{E}$.

        "ground_truth": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime."
