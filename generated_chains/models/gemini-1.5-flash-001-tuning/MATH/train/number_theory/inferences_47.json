I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
        "inference": "Let's try to find a pattern:\n\n* **Base 2:** $11^4 = (1\\cdot2 + 1)^4 = 3^4 = 81 = 1010001_2$. The sum of the digits is 3, which is not $2^4$. \n\n* **Base 3:** $11^4 = (1\\cdot3 + 1)^4 = 4^4 = 256 = 30121_3$. The sum of the digits is 7, which is not $2^4$.\n\n* **Base 4:** $11^4 = (1\\cdot4 + 1)^4 = 5^4 = 625 = 10211_4$. The sum of the digits is 5, which is not $2^4$.\n\n* **Base 5:** $11^4 = (1\\cdot5 + 1)^4 = 6^4 = 1296 = 100011_5$. The sum of the digits is 3, which is not $2^4$.\n\nWe notice that the digits in the base-$b$ representation of $11^4 = (b+1)^4$ are all 0 or 1, except for the first digit.  The sum of the digits is less than $2^4$ unless the first digit is 2 or larger.  We want the largest possible base $b$ for which the first digit is 1.\n\nSince $11^4 = (b+1)^4$, the first digit in base $b$ will be 1 if and only if $1 \\cdot b^4 \\le (b+1)^4 < 2 \\cdot b^4$.  This simplifies to $1 \\le \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)^4 < 2$. Since $2^{1/4} \\approx 1.189$, the largest possible value of $b$ is the largest integer such that $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{b}\\right)^4 < 2$.  We see that $b=5$ works, but $b=6$ does not.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$."
