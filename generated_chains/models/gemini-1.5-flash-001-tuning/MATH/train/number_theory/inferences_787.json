At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{ab}$. Then $100x = ab.\\overline{ab}$, so $99x = ab$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $ab$ is an integer between 10 and 98, inclusive.  Also, $ab$ must be divisible by 99 because $99x = ab$.  The multiples of 99 between 10 and 98 are 33, 66, and 99.  Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $ab$ must be 33, 66, or 99.  Therefore, the possible fractions are $\\frac{33}{99} = \\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{66}{99} = \\frac{2}{3}$, and $\\frac{99}{99} = 1$.  There are only $\\boxed{2}$ different denominators possible. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."

        "inference": "The error is that the solution doesn't consider that a repeating decimal can be written as a fraction with a denominator that is not necessarily a multiple of 99. For example, 0.111... = 1/9.  The solution also doesn't consider the possibility of leading zeros in the repeating block.\n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nLet $x = 0.\\overline{ab}$.  Then $100x = ab.\\overline{ab}$, so $99x = ab$.  Thus, $x = \\frac{ab}{99}$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $ab$ is an integer between 0 and 99, inclusive.  Therefore, the possible denominators are the divisors of 99, which are 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, and 99.  There are $\\boxed{6}$ different denominators possible. \n",
