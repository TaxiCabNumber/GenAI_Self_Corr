Take 8 as an example: $8^1$ ends in 8, $8\\times 8$ ends in 4, $8\\times 4$ ends in $2$, $8\\times 2$ ends in 6, $8\\times 6$ ends in 8, and the pattern repeats from there.  Therefore, the ones digits of $8^1, 8^2, 8^3, \\ldots$ are $8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, \\ldots$.

Therefore, for any digit $d$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $d^a$ is $d$.  Also, if $n$ is a positive integer, then the ones digit of $n^a$ only depends on the ones digit of $n$. Therefore, for any positive integer $n$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $n^a$ is the ones digit of $n$.   Let us write ``$\\equiv$'' to mean ``has the same ones digit as.''  Since $2009$ is one more than a multiple of 4, we find \\begin{align*}\n1^{2009}+2^{2009}+\\cdots+2009^{2009} &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 +\\cdots 2009 \\\\\n&=\\frac{2009(2010)}{2} \\\\\n&= 2009(1005) \\\\\n&\\equiv 9\\cdot 5 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{5}.\n\\end{align*}"
