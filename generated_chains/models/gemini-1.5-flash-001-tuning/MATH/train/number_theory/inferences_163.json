To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$."
