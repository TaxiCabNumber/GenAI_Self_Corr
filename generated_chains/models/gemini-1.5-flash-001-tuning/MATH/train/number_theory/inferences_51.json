The problem asks for the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the equation, not the smallest possible coefficient of $n$. \n\nHere's how to find the correct solution:\n\nSince $23n - 89m = 4$, we have $23n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{89}$.  To solve this congruence, we can use the Euclidean Algorithm as you did to find that $23 \\cdot 33 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{89}$.
