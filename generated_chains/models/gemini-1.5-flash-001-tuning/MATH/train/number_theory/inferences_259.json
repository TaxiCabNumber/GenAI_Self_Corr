        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDonna has $n$ boxes of doughnuts. Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the total number of doughnuts in the bags.  We know that $x$ is one less than the total number of doughnuts Donna has, so $x = 13n - 1$.  We also know that $x$ is divisible by 9, so $x$ must be of the form $9k$ for some integer $k$.  We have the equation $13n-1=9k$, so $13n-9k=1$.\n\nNow we use the Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution $(n_0,k_0)$ to this equation.  Since 13 and 9 are relatively prime, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $13a + 9b = 1$.  We find that $a=2$ and $b=-3$ work.\n\nThen $(n_0,k_0) = (2,-3)$ is a particular solution.  The general solution is of the form $(n_0 + 9t,k_0 + 13t) = (2 + 9t,-3 + 13t)$ for some integer $t$.  We want the smallest positive value of $n$, so we choose $t=1$ to get $n=2+9(1)=\\boxed{11}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$."
