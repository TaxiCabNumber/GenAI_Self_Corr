At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero. Find the three-digit number $abc$.\n",
        "inference": "Solution:  Let $N = 10000k + abcd$, where $k$ is an integer.  Then $N^2 = (10000k + abcd)^2 = 100000000k^2 + 20000k \\cdot abcd + abcd^2$.  Since $N^2$ ends in the digits $abcd$, $abcd^2$ must end in the digits $abcd$.  This means $abcd^2 - abcd$ must be divisible by 10000.  We can factor this as $abcd(abcd - 1)$.\n\nSince $a$ is not zero, $abcd$ is not divisible by 10000.  Therefore, $abcd - 1$ must be divisible by 10000.  This means $abcd - 1$ ends in four zeroes, so $abcd$ must end in four 9's.  The smallest such number is $abcd = 9999$.  We can check that $9999^2 = 99980001$, so $N = 9999$ works.  Therefore, $abc = \\boxed{999}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$."
