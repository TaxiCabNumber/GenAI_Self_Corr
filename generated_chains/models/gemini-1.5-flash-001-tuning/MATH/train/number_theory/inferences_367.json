        "inference": "We want to find an integer $x$ such that $10x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1001}$.  Since 1001 is the product of the primes 7, 11, and 13, we can solve the congruences\n\\begin{align*}\n10x &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\n10x &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}, \\\\\n10x &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}.\n\\end{align*}The first congruence has solution $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, the second has solution $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$, and the third has solution $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo 1001.  We can find this solution by using the method of successive substitution.  Since $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we can write $x = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$.  Substituting into $x \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$, we get $7k + 3 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$, which simplifies to $7k \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$.  This congruence has solution $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, so we can write $k = 11j + 1$ for some integer $j$.  Substituting into $x = 7k + 3$, we get $x = 7(11j + 1) + 3 = 77j + 10$.  Finally, substituting into $x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$, we get $77j + 10 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{13}$, which simplifies to $77j \\equiv -6 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{13}$.  This congruence has solution $j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$, so $x = 77j + 10 \\equiv 77 + 10 \\equiv \\boxed{87} \\pmod{1001}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{87}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
