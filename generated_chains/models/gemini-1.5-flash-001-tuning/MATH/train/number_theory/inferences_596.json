At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two. Find the sum of all possible values of $N$.\n",
        "inference": "Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, with $c = a + b$. We are given that $abc = 6(a + b + c)$.  Substituting $c = a + b$, we get $ab(a + b) = 6(2a + 2b)$.  This simplifies to $ab(a + b) = 12(a + b)$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive, we can divide both sides by $a + b$ to get $ab = 12$.\n\nNow, we need to find all the pairs of positive integers $(a,b)$ that multiply to 12. These are $(1,12)$, $(2,6)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(6,2)$, and $(12,1)$. For each of these pairs, we can calculate $c = a + b$ and then $N = abc$.\n\nThe possible values of $N$ are $12 \\cdot 13$, $2 \\cdot 8$, $3 \\cdot 7$, $3 \\cdot 7$, $2 \\cdot 8$, and $12 \\cdot 13$. The sum of these values is $156 + 16 + 21 + 21 + 16 + 156 = \\boxed{386}$.\n",
