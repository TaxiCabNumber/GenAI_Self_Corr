        "inference": "Let the original integer be $10a + b$, where $a$ is the leftmost digit and $b$ is the remaining part of the number.  We are given that $b = \\frac{1}{29}(10a + b)$.  Multiplying both sides by 29, we get $29b = 10a + b$, so $28b = 10a$.  This tells us that $a$ must be divisible by 14 and $b$ must be divisible by 5.  Since $a$ is a single digit, the smallest possible value for $a$ is 14, which would make $b = 5$.  Therefore, the original integer is $10 \\cdot 14 + 5 = \\boxed{145}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{145}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The desired integer has at least two digits.  Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted.  Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\\cdot\nd+n=29n$, and so $10^p\\cdot d=28n$. Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\\le d\\le9$, it follows that $d=7$. Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\\displaystyle n={{10^p}\\over4}=\n{{100\\cdot10^{p-2}}\\over4}=25\\cdot10^{p-2}$.  Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\\cdot10^p+25\\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\\cdot10^2+25)=725\\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\\ge2$. The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{725}$."
