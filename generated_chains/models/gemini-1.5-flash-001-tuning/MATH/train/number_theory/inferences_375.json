        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of books: $1335 \\text{ boxes} \\times 39 \\text{ books/box} = 51915 \\text{ books}$.\n\nNext, we determine how many boxes Melvin can fill with 40 books each: $51915 \\text{ books} \\div 40 \\text{ books/box} = 1297 \\text{ boxes (with a remainder)}$.\n\nTo find the number of books left over, we multiply the number of boxes that fit by the number of books per box, and then subtract this from the total number of books: $1297 \\text{ boxes} \\times 40 \\text{ books/box} = 51880 \\text{ books}$\n$51915 \\text{ books} - 51880 \\text{ books} = 35 \\text{ books}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{35}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books."
