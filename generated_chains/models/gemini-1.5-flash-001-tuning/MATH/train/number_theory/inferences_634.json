Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
        "inference": "Solution:\nA positive integer $n$ has $d$ positive divisors if and only if it can be written in the form $n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_m^{e_m}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$ are distinct primes and $e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_m$ are nonnegative integers, and $d = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dots (e_m + 1)$.\n\nFirst, we count the number of $7$-nice integers.  We want to find all positive integers $a$ such that $a^7$ has exactly $N$ divisors.  This means we need to find all ways to write $N$ as a product of eight factors, each of the form $e_i + 1$.  The only way to write 7 as a product of eight factors is $7 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 7$, so the only possibility is $e_7 = 6$ and all other $e_i = 0$.  This means $a^7 = p^6$, and the only positive integers less than 1000 of this form are $2^6 = 64$, $3^6 = 729$, and $5^6 = 15625$ (which is too large).  Thus, there are only two $7$-nice integers less than 1000.\n\nNext, we count the number of $8$-nice integers.  We want to find all positive integers $a$ such that $a^8$ has exactly $N$ divisors.  This means we need to find all ways to write $N$ as a product of nine factors, each of the form $e_i + 1$.  We can list the possibilities:\n\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot N$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{2}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{4}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{8}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{16}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{32}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{64}$\n* $N = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{128}$\n* $N = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{256}$\n\nWe need to count the number of positive integers $a$ that satisfy each of these cases.\n\n* In the first case, $a^8 = p^N$, so there is one such $a$ for each prime $p$ such that $p^N < 1000$.  There are 4 primes less than 10, and none of their eighth powers are less than 1000.  There are 2 primes between 10 and 100, and their eighth powers are too large.  So there are no $8$-nice integers of this form.\n\n* In the second case, $a^8 = p^1 \\cdot q^{N/2}$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes.  There are 4 primes less than 10, so there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices for $p$ and $q$.  For each choice, we need to find the largest $N$ such that $p \\cdot q^{N/2} < 1000$.  We can check each of the six cases and find that there are at most 3 possibilities for $N$ in each case.  Thus, there are at most $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$ such $a$.\n\n* In the third case, $a^8 = p^1 \\cdot q^1 \\cdot r^{N/4}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are distinct primes.  There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ choices for $p$, $q$, and $r$.  For each choice, we need to find the largest $N$ such that $p \\cdot q \\cdot r^{N/4} < 1000$.  We can check each of the four cases and find that there are at most 2 possibilities for $N$ in each case.  Thus, there are at most $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ such $a$.\n\n* The remaining cases are similar, and we find that the total number of $8$-nice integers less than 1000 is at most $18 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35$.\n\nTherefore, there are at least $1000 - 2 - 35 = \\boxed{963}$ positive integers less than 1000 that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
        "ground_truth": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$.

Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$.

By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$."
