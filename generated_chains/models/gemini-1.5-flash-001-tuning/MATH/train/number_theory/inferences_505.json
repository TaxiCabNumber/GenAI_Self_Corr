At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7,$ $9,$ and $10,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $12$, what is the remainder?",
        "inference": "Let the three integers be $12a + 7$, $12b + 9$, and $12c + 10$.  Their sum is $12(a + b + c) + 26$, which is equal to $12(a + b + c + 2) + 2$.  Since $12(a + b + c + 2)$ is a multiple of 12, the remainder when the sum is divided by 12 is $\\boxed{2}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 7\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 9\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 10\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 7+9+10 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$."
