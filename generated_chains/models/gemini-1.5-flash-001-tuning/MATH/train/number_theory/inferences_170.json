Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers."
