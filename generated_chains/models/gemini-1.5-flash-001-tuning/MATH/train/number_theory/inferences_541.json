At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{150}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans."
