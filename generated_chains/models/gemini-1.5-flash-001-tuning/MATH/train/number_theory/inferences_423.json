At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes. James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible. In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?",
