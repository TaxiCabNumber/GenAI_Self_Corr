At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of columns in the rectangular formation. Then the number of rows is $x+7$.  The total number of band members is then $x(x+7)$.\n\nSince there are 5 members left over when the band members are arranged in a square formation, the number of band members is one more than a perfect square.  We can write this as $x(x+7)=n^2+5$ for some integer $n$.\n\nRearranging, we get $x^2+7x-n^2-5=0$.  We can factor this as $(x-n)(x+n+7)=5$.\n\nThe only way to factor 5 is as $1\\cdot5$ or $5\\cdot1$.  We can try both cases:\n\n* If $x-n=1$ and $x+n+7=5$, then solving for $x$ and $n$, we get $x=1$ and $n=-1$.  This is not a valid solution since $n$ must be an integer.\n\n* If $x-n=5$ and $x+n+7=1$, then solving for $x$ and $n$, we get $x=1$ and $n=-6$.  This is also not a valid solution since $n$ must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions. This means there is an error in the problem statement, and it is impossible to determine the maximum number of band members. \n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{No Solution}\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$."

        "inference": "You are absolutely right! The error in the solution lies in assuming that the number of band members must be one *more* than a perfect square.  The problem states that there are *five* members left over when arranged in a square, meaning the number of band members is *five less* than a perfect square. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $x$ be the number of columns in the rectangular formation. Then the number of rows is $x+7$.  The total number of band members is then $x(x+7)$.\n\nSince there are 5 members left over when the band members are arranged in a square formation, the number of band members is five less than a perfect square.  We can write this as $x(x+7)=n^2-5$ for some integer $n$.\n\nRearranging, we get $x^2+7x-n^2+5=0$.  We can factor this as $(x-n)(x+n+7)=-5$.\n\nThe only way to factor -5 is as $-1\\cdot5$ or $5\\cdot-1$.

This is not a valid solution since $n$ must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is $x=1$ and $n=2$.  This means there are $x(x+7)=1(1+7)=\\boxed{8}$ band members. \n",
