        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
        "inference": "Let $w$ be the number of words on each page.  Then the total number of words in the book is $136w$.  We are given that $136w \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$.  Since 136 and 203 are relatively prime, we can divide both sides by 136: \\[w \\equiv 184 \\cdot 136^{-1} \\pmod{203}.\\]To find $136^{-1} \\pmod{203}$, we use the Euclidean Algorithm: \\begin{align*}\n203 &= 1 \\cdot 136 + 67, \\\\\n136 &= 2 \\cdot 67 + 2, \\\\\n67 &= 33 \\cdot 2 + 1.\n\\end{align*}Hence, \\[1 = 67 - 33 \\cdot 2 = 67 - 33(136 - 2 \\cdot 67) = 67 \\cdot 67 - 33 \\cdot 136.\\]Thus, $136^{-1} \\equiv -33 \\equiv 170 \\pmod{203}$, so \\[w \\equiv 184 \\cdot 170 \\equiv \\boxed{94} \\pmod{203}.\\] Final Answer: $\\boxed{94}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it."
