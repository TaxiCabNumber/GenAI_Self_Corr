        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, positive factors does $1100$ have?",
        "inference": "First, we factor $1100$ as $1100=2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. \nTo find the number of factors of 1100, we add one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results.  So, the number of factors is $(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{18}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $1100$ is $2^2\\cdot5^2\\cdot11$. To find the number of factors, we consider that each factor has a prime factorization of $2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot11^c$, where $a$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), $b$ could be from $0$ to $2$ (3 possible values), and $c$ could be $0$ or $1$ (2 possible values). So the number of factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=\\boxed{18}$."
