At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let $n=0.42\\overline{153}$.  Multiplying both sides by 100 gives $100n=42.\\overline{153}$.  Multiplying both sides by 1000 gives $1000n=42153.\\overline{153}$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $900n=42111$, so $n=\\frac{42111}{900}$.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 110 gives $n=\\frac{42111\\cdot 110}{900\\cdot 110}=\\frac{4632210}{99900}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4632210}$. I hope it is correct.",
