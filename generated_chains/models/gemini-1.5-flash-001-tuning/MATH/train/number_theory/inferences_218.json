At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",

The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$."
