        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of cookies Eleanor made.  Then we have the following system of congruences: \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}.\n\\end{align*} From the first congruence, we see that $x$ is of the form $11k + 4$ for some integer $k$.  Substituting into the second congruence, we get \\[11k + 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}.\\] This simplifies to $4k \\equiv -3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  Since 4 and 7 are relatively prime, we can divide both sides by 4, to get $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Thus, $k$ is of the form $7j + 1$ for some integer $j$.  Substituting back, we get \\[x = 11k + 4 = 11(7j + 1) + 4 = 77j + 15.\\] The smallest positive value of $x$ occurs when $j = 0$, which gives us $x = 15$.  Since Eleanor made fewer than 100 cookies, the possible values of $x$ are 15, 92, and $169$. The sum of these numbers is $15 + 92 + 169 = \\boxed{276}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$"
