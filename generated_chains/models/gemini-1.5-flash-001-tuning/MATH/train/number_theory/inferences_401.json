To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by all of these, we find their least common multiple (LCM).\n\n* The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6.\n* The LCM of 6 and 5 is 30.\n* The LCM of 30 and 7 is 210.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number is 1000.  We divide 1000 by 210 to get 4 with a remainder of 160.\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit number divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7 is 1000 + (210 - 160) = 1050.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1050}$.

        "ground_truth": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$."
