At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes. How many other positive integers are the products of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a+b+c$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nThe prime factorization of $5002$ is $2\\cdot 7 \\cdot 11\\cdot 17$, so $a=2$, $b=7$, and $c=11$.\n\nSince $a+b+c = 2+7+11=20$, we are looking for other sets of three primes that sum to $20$.  The possible primes are $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, and $17$. We can check these primes to see if they add up to $20$:\n\n* $2 + 5 + 13 = 20$\n* $2 + 7 + 11 = 20$\n* $3 + 5 + 12 = 20$ (12 is not prime)\n* $3 + 7 + 10 = 20$ (10 is not prime)\n* $5 + 7 + 8 = 20$ (8 is not prime)\n\nTherefore, there are three distinct sets of three primes that add up to 20: $\\{2, 5, 13\\}$, $\\{2, 7, 11\\}$ and $\\{3, 5, 12\\}$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$.

        "ground_truth": "5002 factors to $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, which sums to 104.  Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102.  We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime.  We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already.  In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\\boxed{7 \\text{ distinct integers}}$."

        "inference": "The solution has a small error. While it correctly finds the prime factorizations of 5002, it then incorrectly focuses on finding sets of three primes that sum to 20. \n\nThe question asks for the number of **distinct** sets of three primes that sum to the **same** number as the sum of the prime factors of 5002. We've already found that sum to be 20. \n\nWe only need to find the number of sets of three primes that add up to 20.
