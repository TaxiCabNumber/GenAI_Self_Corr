        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest two-digit integer $n$ such that switching its digits and then adding 3 results in $2n$?",
        "inference": "Let the tens digit of $n$ be $a$ and the units digit be $b$.  Then $n = 10a + b$.  Switching the digits gives us $10b + a$, and adding 3 gives $10b + a + 3$.  We are given that this is equal to $2n$, so \\[10b + a + 3 = 2(10a + b).\\] Simplifying, we get $8b - 19a = -3$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, we see that $a$ must be 1.  This gives us $8b = 16$, so $b = 2$.  Therefore, $n = 10a + b = \\boxed{12}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
