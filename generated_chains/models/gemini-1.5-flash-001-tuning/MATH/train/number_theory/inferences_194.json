        "inference": "Solution:\n\nWe know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their least common multiple and greatest common divisor.  Therefore, we have $180x = 3780 \\cdot 18$, where $x$ is the other number.  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{3780 \\cdot 18}{180} = 378$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{378}$.

We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$."
