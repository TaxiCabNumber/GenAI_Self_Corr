At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{165}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members."
