At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen three positive integers are divided by $47$, the remainders are $25$, $20$, and $3$, respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $47$, what is the remainder?",
        "inference": "Let the three integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Then we can write\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 47k + 25, \\\\\nb &= 47l + 20, \\\\\nc &= 47m + 3\n\\end{align*}for some integers $k$, $l$, and $m$.  Then\n\\[a + b + c = 47(k + l + m) + 25 + 20 + 3 = 47(k + l + m) + 48.\\]Since $48 = 47 + 1$, the remainder when $a + b + c$ is divided by 47 is $\\boxed{1}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$."
