At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA whole number is said to be ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5. What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?",
