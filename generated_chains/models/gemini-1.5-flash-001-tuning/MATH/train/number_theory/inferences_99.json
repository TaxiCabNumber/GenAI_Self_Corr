        "inference": "The cube root of a number between 8 and 8.1 is greater than 8 and less than 8.1.  Since 8 is the cube root of 512 and 8.1 is the cube root of 531.441, we want to find a multiple of 18 between 512 and 531.441.

        "ground_truth": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer."
