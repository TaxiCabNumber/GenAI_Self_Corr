At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat two-digit positive integer is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?",

Therefore, any number that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 must be of the form 60n + 1, where n is an integer. The smallest such two-digit number is when n = 1, giving us 60(1) + 1 = 61. \n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{61}. I hope it is correct. \n",
