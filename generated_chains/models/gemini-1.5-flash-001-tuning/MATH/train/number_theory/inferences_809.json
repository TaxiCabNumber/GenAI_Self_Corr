At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$."
