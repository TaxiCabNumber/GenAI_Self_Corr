        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many digits are there in the base-7 representation of $956$?",
        "inference": "First, find the largest power of 7 that is less than 956.  We have $7^4 = 2401$ and $7^3 = 343$, so $7^3$ is the largest power of 7 less than 956.  We can write  \\[956 = 2 \\cdot 7^3 + 227.\\]Now we need to find the largest power of 7 less than 227.  We have $7^2 = 49$ and $7^1 = 7$, so $7^2$ is the largest power of 7 less than 227.  We can write  \\[227 = 4 \\cdot 7^2 + 39.\\]Finally, we need to find the largest power of 7 less than 39.  We have $7^1 = 7$, so $7^1$ is the largest power of 7 less than 39.  We can write  \\[39 = 5 \\cdot 7^1 + 4.\\]Thus, the base-7 representation of 956 is $2454_7$.  There are $\\boxed{4}$ digits.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits."
