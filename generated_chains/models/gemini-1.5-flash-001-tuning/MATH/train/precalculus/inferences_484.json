At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The lines are coplanar if and only if the direction vectors of the lines and the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line are linearly dependent.  This means that the determinant\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\ -k & 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]is equal to 0.  Expanding the determinant, we get\n\\[-k - 3k - 1 + 2k - 1 + 3k^2 = 0.\\]This simplifies to $3k^2 - 2k - 2 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula,\n\\[k = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot -2}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{3}.\\]Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{3}}.$ I hope it is correct. \n",
