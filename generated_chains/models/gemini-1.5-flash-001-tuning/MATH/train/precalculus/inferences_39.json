        "inference": "The error is in assuming that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers. The problem does not state this.\n\nWe can simplify the system of equations as follows:\n\n* $15a = 20b$\n* $16b = 12a$\n* $16c = 20d$\n* $15d = 12c$\n\nFrom the first equation, $a = \\frac{4}{3} b$.  From the second equation, $a = \\frac{4}{3} b$.  From the third equation, $c = \\frac{5}{4} d$.  From the fourth equation, $c = \\frac{5}{4} d$.  Thus, we can choose any value for $b$ and $d$, and then find $a$ and $c$.  For example, if we take $b = 3$ and $d = 4$, then $a = 4$ and $c = 5$, so $a + b + c + d = \\boxed{16}$.",
