        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes $\\omega^2 = 0$, which is not true.  Here's a corrected approach:\n\nSince $\\omega$ is a root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$, we know $\\omega^4 - \\omega^2 + 1 = 0$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\omega^2$, we get:\n\n\\[\\omega^6 - \\omega^4 + \\omega^2 = 0.\\]This factors as $\\omega^2 (\\omega^4 - \\omega^2 + 1) = 0$.  Since $\\omega^4 - \\omega^2 + 1 = 0$, we have $\\omega^2 = 0$.  But this is impossible, as $\\omega$ is a root of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$, which means $\\omega^2 \\neq 0$.\n\nInstead, we can recognize that the equation $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$ is a quadratic in $z^2$.  Let $y = z^2$.  Then we have $y^2 - y + 1 = 0$.  By the quadratic formula,\n\\[y = \\frac{1 \\pm i \\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]Since $y = z^2$, we have\n\\[z^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm i \\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get\n\\[z = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm i \\sqrt{3}}{2}}.\\]These four values of $z$ are the roots of $z^4 - z^2 + 1 = 0$.  We can see that they are all sixth roots of unity.\n\nTherefore, the smallest such $n$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
