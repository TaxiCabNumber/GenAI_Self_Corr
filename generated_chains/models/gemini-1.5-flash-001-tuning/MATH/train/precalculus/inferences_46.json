        "inference": "You are absolutely correct!  The error lies in assuming the graph passes through the point $(0,2)$.  The cosecant function has vertical asymptotes at multiples of its period, and its value is undefined at those points.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe graph of $y = a \\csc bx$ has vertical asymptotes at multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{b}$. The graph shows that the vertical asymptotes are at multiples of $\\pi$, so $b = 1$.
