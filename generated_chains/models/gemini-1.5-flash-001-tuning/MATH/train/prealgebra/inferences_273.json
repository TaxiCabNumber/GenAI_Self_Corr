At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pizza parlor has six different toppings. How many different one- and two-topping pizzas can you order?",

        "ground_truth": "Obviously, there are $6$ one-topping pizzas.\n\nNow we count the two-topping pizzas. There are $6$ options for the first topping and $5$ options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $6\\cdot5=30$ options. However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means there are really only $\\dfrac{6\\cdot5}{2}=15$ two-topping pizzas.\n\nAdding our answers, we see that there are $6+15=\\boxed{21}$ possible pizzas with one or two toppings."
