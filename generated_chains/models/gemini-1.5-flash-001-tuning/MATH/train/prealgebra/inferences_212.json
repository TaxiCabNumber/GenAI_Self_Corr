At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex bakes a total of $24$ pies, and each pie is apple, blueberry, or cherry. The ratio of apple to blueberry to cherry pies is $1:4:3$. How many cherry pies did Alex bake?",
