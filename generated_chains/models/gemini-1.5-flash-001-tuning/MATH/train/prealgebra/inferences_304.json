        "inference": "Let the side length of the smallest square be $a$, the side length of the middle square be $b$, and the side length of the largest square be $c$.  Then $a^2+b^2+c^2=338$.  Since $PQR$ is a right angle, we have $a^2+b^2=c^2$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.  Substituting, we have $c^2+c^2=338$, so $c^2=169$.  Since $c$ is positive, we have $c=13$, and the area of the largest square is $c^2=13^2=\\boxed{169}$ square centimeters. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{169}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PQ^2+QR^2$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, $PR^2=PQ^2+QR^2$.  Substituting the left-hand side of this equation for the right-hand side, we find that the sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PR^2=2\\cdot PR^2$.  Setting this equal to 338 square centimeters, we find that $PR^2=338/2=\\boxed{169}$ square centimeters."
