She plans to cover the one shaded exterior wall and the two rectangular faces of the roof, also shaded, with a special siding to resist the elements. The siding is sold only in 8-foot by 12-foot sections that cost $\\$27.30$ each. If Sandy can cut the siding when she gets home, how many dollars will be the cost of the siding Sandy must purchase?\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\nsize(101);\ncurrentprojection=orthographic(1/3,-1,1/2);\nreal w = 1.5;\nreal theta = pi/4;\nstring dottedline = \"2 4\";\ndraw(surface((0,0,0)--(8,0,0)--(8,0,6)--(0,0,6)--cycle),gray(.7)+opacity(.5));\ndraw(surface((0,0,6)--(0,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,0,6)--cycle),gray(.7)+opacity(.5));\ndraw(surface((0,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,10cos(theta),6)--(0,10cos(theta),6)--cycle),gray\n\n(.7)+opacity(.5));\ndraw((0,0,0)--(8,0,0)--(8,0,6)--(0,0,6)--cycle,black+linewidth(w));\ndraw((0,0,6)--(0,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(8,0,6)--cycle,black+linewidth(w));\ndraw((8,0,0)--(8,10cos(theta),0)--(8,10cos(theta),6)--(8,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta)),linewidth(w));\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,10cos(theta),0)--(0,10cos(theta),6)--(0,0,6),linetype(dottedline));\ndraw((0,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta))--(0,10cos(theta),6)--(8,10cos(theta),6)--(8,0,6),linetype(dottedline));\ndraw((0,10cos(theta),0)--(8,10cos(theta),0),linetype(dottedline));\nlabel(\"8' \",(4,5cos(theta),6+5sin(theta)),N);\nlabel(\"5' \",(0,5cos(theta)/2,6+5sin(theta)/2),NW);\nlabel(\"6' \",(0,0,3),W);\nlabel(\"8' \",(4,0,0),S);\n[/asy]",
