At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGrandma gave Bryce and Carter some raisins. Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, and Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce received. How many raisins did Bryce receive?",
        "inference": "Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n* **Let 'x' be the number of raisins Carter received.** \n* **Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, so Bryce received x + 6 raisins.**\n* **Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce received, meaning x = (x + 6)/2.**\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n* **2x = x + 6**\n* **2x - x = 6**\n* **x = 6**\n\nSince Carter received 6 raisins, Bryce received x + 6 raisins:\n\n* **Bryce received 6 + 6 = 12 raisins.**\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of raisins Bryce received be $x$. Since Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, Carter received $x-6$ raisins. Since Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce did, Carter also received $x/2$ raisins. We have two ways of expressing the number of raisins Carter received, so we have the equation $x-6=x/2$, or $x=12$. Thus, Bryce received $\\boxed{12}$ raisins."
