        "inference": "You're right, there's a missing piece of information in the problem.  We need to know the relationship between the square and the triangle to solve for the height of the triangle. Here are some possibilities:\n\n* **The triangle is inside the square:**  If the base of the triangle is a side of the square, then the height of the triangle is equal to the side length of the square.  \n* **The square is inside the triangle:**  If the square is inscribed within the triangle, the height of the triangle would be greater than the side length of the square. We'd need more information to solve for the height.\n\n**Without more context, we can't definitively solve for the height of the triangle.** \n",
