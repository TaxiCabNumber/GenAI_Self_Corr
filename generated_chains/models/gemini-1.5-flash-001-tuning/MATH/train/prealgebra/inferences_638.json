At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the ten letters in ``MATHCOUNTS'' is written on its own square tile and placed in a bag. What is the probability that a tile randomly selected from the bag will have a letter on it that is in the word ``TEACH''? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
