At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and nickel both come up heads?",

There are 2 possibilities for the dime and 2 for the quarter, so there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ successful outcomes, and the probability of this is $\\dfrac{4}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$."
