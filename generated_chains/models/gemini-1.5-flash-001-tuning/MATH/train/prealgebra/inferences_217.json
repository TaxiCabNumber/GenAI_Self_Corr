At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average value of all the pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters in Paula's purse is 20 cents.  If she had one more quarter, the average value would be 21 cents.  How many dimes does she have in her purse?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the total value (in cents) of Paula's coins, and let $y$ be the number of coins she has. Since the average value of her coins is 20 cents, we have the equation $\\frac{x}{y} = 20$. If she had one more quarter, she would have $y+1$ coins and a total value of $x+25$ cents.  The average value would then be $\\frac{x+25}{y+1} = 21$. We can solve the system of equations:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 20 \\\\\n\\frac{x+25}{y+1} &= 21.\n\\end{aligned}\\]Multiplying the first equation by $y$ and the second equation by $y+1$, we get\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nx &= 20y \\\\\nx + 25 &= 21(y+1).\n\\end{aligned}\\]Substituting $x=20y$ into the second equation, we get $20y + 25 = 21y + 21$. Solving for $y$, we find $y=4$. Since the average value of Paula's coins is 20 cents, the total value of her coins is $20\\cdot 4 = 80$ cents. \n\nLet $p$ be the number of pennies, $n$ be the number of nickels, $d$ be the number of dimes, and $q$ be the number of quarters. We know $p+n+d+q=4$, and we also know that $p+5n+10d+25q=80$.\n\nSince we are trying to find the number of dimes, we want to eliminate $p$, $n$, and $q$ from the equations. We can subtract the first equation multiplied by 5 from the second equation to get $5d + 20q = 60$. Then, we can subtract the first equation multiplied by 10 from the second equation to get $5n + 15q = 40$.\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns:\n\\begin{align*}\n5d + 20q &= 60, \\\\\n5n + 15q &= 40.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can divide the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 5 to get:\n\\begin{align*}\nd + 4q &= 12, \\\\\nn + 3q &= 8.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can solve for $d$ and $n$ in terms of $q$:\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= 12 - 4q, \\\\\nn &= 8 - 3q.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $p$, $n$, $d$, and $q$ must be non-negative integers, we must have $q \\le 3$.  If $q = 3$, then $d = 0$, $n = -1$, and $p = 2$.  If $q = 2$, then $d = 4$, $n = 2$, and $p = 0$.  If $q = 1$, then $d = 8$, $n = 5$, and $p = -3$.  If $q = 0$, then $d = 12$, $n = 8$, and $p = -10$.\n\nTherefore, Paula has $\\boxed{4}$ dimes in her purse.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the number of coins in Paula's purse, then their total value is $20n$ cents. If she had one more quarter, she would have $n+1$ coins whose total value in cents could be expressed both as $20n+25$ and as $21(n+1)$. Therefore \\[\n20n + 25 = 21 (n+1), \\quad \\text{so} \\quad n=4.\n\\]Since Paula has four coins with a total value of 80 cents, she must have three quarters and one nickel, so the number of dimes is $\\boxed{0}$."

        "inference": "The solution is correct. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n* **The problem asks for the number of dimes Paula has.** The solution correctly focuses on finding the value of `d`, the number of dimes.\n* **The initial setup is sound.**  The problem is set up with two equations representing the average value of Paula's coins before and after adding a quarter.\n* **The logic for eliminating variables is valid.**  Subtracting multiples of the first equation from the second equation effectively eliminates `p`, `n`, and `q`, leaving only `d` and `q`.\n* **The final calculations are accurate.** The solution correctly finds the values of `d` and `n` in terms of `q` and then tests different possible values of `q` to find the only solution where all variables are non-negative integers.\n\nTherefore, the solution is **correct**.  Paula has **4** dimes in her purse.  \n",
