What is the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to the unit price of Brand Y soda? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let's assume Brand Y soda costs $\\$1$ per unit and contains 1 unit of soda. \n\n* **Brand X's price:**  Brand X's price is 10% less than Brand Y's price, so it costs $1 - 0.10(1) = \\$0.90$.\n\n* **Brand X's soda amount:** Brand X gives 20% more soda than Brand Y, so it contains $1 + 0.20(1) = 1.2$ units of soda.\n\n* **Brand X's unit price:** The unit price of Brand X is the price divided by the amount of soda: $0.90 / 1.2 = \\$0.75$ per unit.\n\n* **Ratio:** The ratio of Brand X's unit price to Brand Y's unit price is $0.75/1 = 3/4$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.** I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda. Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.\n\nIt follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$. The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\\dfrac{p}{v}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$"
