At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA trapezoid has one base equal to twice its height, $x$, and the other base is three times as long as the height. Write the expression for the area of the trapezoid as a common fraction in terms of the height $x$.",

        "ground_truth": "The area of a trapezoid is equal to the product of the height and the average of the lengths of the bases. In this case, since the length of the two bases are $2x$ and $3x$ and the length of the height is $x$, the area is equal to $\\frac{2x+3x}{2} \\cdot x=\\frac{5x}{2}\\cdot x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5x^2}{2}}$."
