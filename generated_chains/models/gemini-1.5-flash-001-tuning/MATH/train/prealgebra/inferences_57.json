At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI need to learn vocabulary words for my Spanish exam. There are 500 words and the exam grade is the percentage of these words that I recall correctly. Assuming I will recall correctly the words I learn and assuming my guesses will not yield any points, what is the least number of words I should learn to get at least $85\\%$ on the exam?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the exam grade is the percentage of words I recall correctly, we can set up a proportion to find the minimum number of words I need to learn: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\text{number of words I need to learn}}{\\text{total words}}&=\\frac{85\\%}{100\\%}\\\\\n\\frac{x}{500}&=\\frac{85}{100}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{85}{100}\\cdot 500\\\\\nx&=85\\cdot 5\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{425}.\n\\end{align*}Learning 425 words will lead to a score of exactly $85\\%$, so I do not need to learn any more words than 425."
