At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSandy plans to paint one wall in her bedroom. The wall is 9 feet high and 12 feet long. There is a 2-foot by 4-foot area on that wall that she will not have to paint due to the window. How many square feet will she need to paint?",
