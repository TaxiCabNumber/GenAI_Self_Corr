At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a designer suit, Daniel must specify his waist size in centimeters. If there are $12$ inches in a foot and $30.5$ centimeters in a foot, then what size should Daniel specify, in centimeters, if his waist size in inches is $34$ inches?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest tenth.)",
