At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve students in Mrs. Stephenson's class have brown eyes. Twenty students in the class have a lunch box. Of Mrs. Stephenson's 30 students, what is the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box?",
