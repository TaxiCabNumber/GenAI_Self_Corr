        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe $\\$4.55$ in Carol's piggy bank consists of quarters and nickels. There are seven more nickels than quarters. How many nickels does Carol have in her bank?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the number of quarters.\nThen $x + 7$ represents the number of nickels.\nSince the value of each quarter is $\\$0.25$, the value of $x$ quarters is $0.25x$ dollars.\nSince the value of each nickel is $\\$0.05$, the value of $x + 7$ nickels is $0.05(x + 7)$ dollars.\nThe total value of the quarters and nickels is $\\$4.55$, so we can write the equation $0.25x + 0.05(x + 7) = 4.55$.\nSimplifying, we have $0.25x + 0.05x + 0.35 = 4.55$.\nCombining like terms, we have $0.3x + 0.35 = 4.55$.\nSubtracting $0.35$ from both sides, we have $0.3x = 4.2$.\nDividing both sides by $0.3$, we have $x = 14$.\nTherefore, there are $14 + 7 = 21$ nickels.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{21}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ and $q$ represent the respective numbers of nickels and quarters. Since there are seven more nickels than quarters, we know that $q=n-7$. In cents, the amount of money Carol has is $5n+25q=455$. We substitute the expression of $q$ in terms of $n$ from the first equation into the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n5n+25(n-7)&=455\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5(n-7)&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5n-35&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6n&=126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&=21\n\\end{align*} Carol has $\\boxed{21}$ nickels in her piggy bank."
