At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nFirst, we convert the driving times to hours:\n\n5 hours, 20 minutes = 5 + (20/60) = 5.33 hours\n6 hours, 40 minutes = 6 + (40/60) = 6.67 hours\n\nNext, we find the total distance driven:\n\n300 miles + 360 miles = 660 miles\n\nThen, we find the total driving time:\n\n5.33 hours + 6.67 hours = 12 hours\n\nFinally, we calculate Stan's average speed:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time = 660 miles / 12 hours = 55 miles per hour\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{55}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
