At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The proportion of lemons to gallons of lemonade must always remain constant. Thus, $\\frac{24}{32} = \\frac{x}{4}$, where $x$ is the number of lemons required to make $4$ gallons of lemonade. $\\frac{24}{32}$ simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4}$, so we have $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{x}{4}$.
