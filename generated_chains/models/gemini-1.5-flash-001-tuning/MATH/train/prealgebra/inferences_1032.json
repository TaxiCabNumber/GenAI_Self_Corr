At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Chemistry class, Samantha finds that she can make a certain solution by mixing $.04$ liters of chemical A with $.02$ liters of water (this gives her $.06$ liters of the solution). She wants to make a total of $.48$ liters of this new solution.  To do so, how many liters of water will she use?",
