At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAfter eating lunch together, Jay and Paul start walking in opposite directions. Jay walks 0.75 miles every 15 minutes and Paul power walks 2.5 miles every 30 minutes. In miles, how far apart are they after 1.5 hours?",
