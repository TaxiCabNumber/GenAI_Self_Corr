At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle and a square have the same perimeter of 12 inches. What is the ratio of the side length of the triangle to the side length of the square? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The side length of the equilateral triangle is $12/3 = 4$ inches.  The side length of the square is $12/4 = 3$ inches.  The ratio of the side length of the triangle to the side length of the square is $4/3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "They have the same perimeter, but that is divided among 4 sides for a square, and 3 sides for an equilateral triangle, and thus, the triangle's side length is $\\frac{4}{3}$ times as long as that of the square.\n\nTo be more precise, you can call $t$ the side length of the equilateral triangle, and $s$ the side length of the square, and set up the equations: $3t = 12$, and $4s = 12$, which yields $t = 4$, and $s = 3$, from which it is clear that the ratio of the side length of the triangle to that of the square is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$."
