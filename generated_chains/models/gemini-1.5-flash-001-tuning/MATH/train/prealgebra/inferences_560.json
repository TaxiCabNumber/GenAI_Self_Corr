At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf an integer is divisible by $4$ and the sum of its last two digits is $13$, then what is the product of its last two digits?",

Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$.  So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\\cdot B = 7\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{42}$."
