At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many digits $C$ is the positive three-digit number $1C3$ a multiple of 3?",

Thus, we want to find the number of digits $C$ between 0 and 9 such that $C + 4$ is divisible by 3.  The possible values of $C$ are 2, 5, and 8, so there are $\\boxed{3}$ such digits. Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
