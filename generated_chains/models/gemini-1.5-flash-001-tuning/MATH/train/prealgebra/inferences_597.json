I hope it is correct.'\nBill buys a stock that decreases by $20\\%$ on the first day, and then  on the second day the stock increases by $30\\%$ of its value at the end of the first day. What was the overall percent increase in Bill's stock over the two days?",
        "inference": "Let's assume Bill bought the stock for $\\$100$. After the first day, the stock decreases by $20\\%$ of $\\$100$, which is $\\$20$. So the stock is now worth $\\$100 - \\$20 = \\$80$. On the second day, the stock increases by $30\\%$ of $\\$80$, which is $0.3 \\cdot \\$80 = \\$24$. So the stock is now worth $\\$80 + \\$24 = \\$104$. Since the stock started at $\\$100$ and ended at $\\$104$, there was a $4\\%$ increase in the value of the stock.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original value of the stock be $x$. At the end of the first day, the stock has fallen to $.8x$. On the second day, the stock rises to $1.3(.8x)=1.04x$. Thus, the stock has increased $\\boxed{4}$ percent from its original price over the two days."
