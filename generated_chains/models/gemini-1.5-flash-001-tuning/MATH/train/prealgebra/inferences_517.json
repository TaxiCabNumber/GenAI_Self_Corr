At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChristine must buy at least $45$ fluid ounces of milk at the store. The store only sells milk in $200$ milliliter bottles. If there are $33.8$ fluid ounces in $1$ liter, then what is the smallest number of bottles that Christine could buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",

        "ground_truth": "First we convert the amount of milk Christine must buy from ounces to liters. We use the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}}$ to obtain $45\\ \\text{fl.oz} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}} \\approx 1.331\\ \\text{L}$. There are $1000\\ \\text{mL}$ in one liter, and $\\frac{1331}{200} \\approx 6.657$, so Christine must buy at least $\\boxed{7}$ bottles of milk at the store."
