At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam has $15$ of a certain type of rare coin and is interested in knowing how much this collection is worth.  He discovers that $5$ of these coins are worth $12$ dollars in total. Assuming that the value of each coin is the same, how many dollars is his entire collection worth?",
