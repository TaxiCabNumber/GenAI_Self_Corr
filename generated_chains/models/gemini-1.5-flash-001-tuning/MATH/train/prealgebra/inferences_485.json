        "ground_truth": "Let's look at the numerator of the big fraction first. To add $\\frac{1}{3}$ to $\\frac{1}{4}$, we must first find a common denominator. In this case, it's $12$. So \\[\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1\\cdot4}{3\\cdot4} + \\frac{1\\cdot3}{4\\cdot3} = \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{4+3}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}.\\]Similarly, looking at the denominator of the big fraction, we must again find a common denominator. In this case, it's $30$.

Remembering that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, we get \\[\\frac{~\\frac{7}{12}~}{\\frac{7}{30}} = \\frac{7}{12} \\times \\frac{30}{7} = \\frac{30}{12}.\\]But $\\frac{30}{12}$ can be written as $\\frac{6\\cdot5}{6\\cdot2}$, so our answer simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$."
