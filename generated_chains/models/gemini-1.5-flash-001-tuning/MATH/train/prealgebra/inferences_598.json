At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo concentric circles with radii of 19 and 29 units bound a shaded region. A third circle will be drawn with area equal to that of the shaded area. What must the radius of the third circle be? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),29),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),19),white);\n\ndot((0,0));\n\ndraw((0,0)--19dir(45),linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"19\",9.5dir(45),NW);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe area of the shaded region is the difference of the areas of the two circles.  The area of the larger circle is $\\pi(29^2) = 841\\pi$ square units, and the area of the smaller circle is $\\pi(19^2) = 361\\pi$ square units.  The area of the shaded region is $841\\pi - 361\\pi = 480\\pi$ square units.  Let $r$ be the radius of the third circle.  Then $\\pi r^2 = 480\\pi$, so $r^2 = 480$.  Since $480 = 16 \\cdot 30$, we have $r = \\sqrt{16 \\cdot 30} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}$ units. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the shaded region is everything inside the larger circle but outside the smaller, its area is $29^2 \\pi - 19^2\\pi = 480\\pi$.  So, letting the radius of the third circle be $r$, we have $\\pi r^2 = 480 \\pi$, or $r = \\sqrt{480} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{30}}$."
