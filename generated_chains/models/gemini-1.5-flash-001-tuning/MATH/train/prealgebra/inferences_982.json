        "ground_truth": "Because $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the money was spent on movies and there is 30 dollars, the amount of money spent on movies is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30=10$ dollars. Likewise, $\\frac{3}{10} \\cdot 30=9$ dollars were spent on music and $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 30 = 6$ dollars were spent on ice cream. Thus, the total amount of money spent on movies, music, and ice cream is $\\$10+\\$9+\\$6=\\$25$. The remaining amount of money is spent on burgers.
