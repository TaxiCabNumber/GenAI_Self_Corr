In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of different colors?",

If the socks are white and brown, there are 4 options for the white sock and 4 options for the brown sock for a total of 16 choices.  If the socks are brown and blue, there are 4 options for the brown sock and 2 options for the blue sock for a total of 8 choices.
