        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSolve for $x$ in the equation $ \\frac35 \\cdot \\frac19 \\cdot x = 6$.",
        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying the fractions: $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{3}{45} = \\frac{1}{15}$.\n2. The equation now becomes: $\\frac{1}{15} \\cdot x = 6$.\n3. To isolate $x$, multiply both sides of the equation by 15: $x = 6 \\cdot 15$.\n4. Calculate the product on the right side: $x = 90$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{3}$ gives $\\frac{1}{9} \\cdot x = 6\\cdot \\frac53 = 10$, and then multiplying by 9 gives $x = \\boxed{90}$."
