At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$500$ in maintenance fees each day and then it pays each worker $\\$15$ per hour. Each worker makes 5 widgets per hour, which are sold at $\\$3.10$ each. What is the least number of workers the company has to hire in order to make a profit in an 8-hour workday?",

        "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of workers $n$ such that the cost is less than the revenue in a day of work. The cost of each worker is $\\$15$ per hour, while the revenue that comes from each worker hired is $\\$3.10\\times5$ widgets per hour. \\begin{align*}\n500+8(15n)&<(8)(3.1)(5)n=124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500+120n&<124n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n500&<4n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n125&<n.\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than 125 is 126, so the company has to hire at least $\\boxed{126}$ workers to make a profit."
