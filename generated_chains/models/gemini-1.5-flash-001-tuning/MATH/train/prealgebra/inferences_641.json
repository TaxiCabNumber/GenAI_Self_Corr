        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Quill and Scroll is a stationery shop.  Its stock and sales for May are listed in the table shown. What percent of its sales were not pens or pencils? \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\\\\\hline\n\\textbf{Item}&\\textbf{$\\%$~of May Sales}\\\\\\hline\nPens&38\\\\\\hline\nPencils&35\\\\\\hline\nOther&?\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
        "inference": "Pens and pencils made up 38% + 35% = 73% of the sales.  This means that 100% - 73% = 27% of the sales were not pens or pencils.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since all three percentages must add to equal $100,$ the percentage of other items is $100-38-35=\\boxed{27\\%}.$"
