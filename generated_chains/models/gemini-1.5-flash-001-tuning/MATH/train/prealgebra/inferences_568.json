        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe longest side of a right triangle is 5 meters and the shortest side is 3 meters. What is the area of the triangle in square meters?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the hypotenuse (the longest side) of the right triangle is $5$ meters and the shortest side is $3$ meters and that $3,4,5$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, the other leg of the triangle must have a length of $4$ meters. Since the two legs are also the base and the height of the triangle, we have that the area of the triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = \\boxed{6}$ square meters.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the Pythagorean Formula to find the length of the other side. If $y$ is the length of the other leg, then we have that $3^2 + y^2 = 5^2$, so $y^2=5^2-3^2=16$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $y=4$. Since we have the lengths of both legs, we can now find that the area of the triangle is $6$ square meters."
