        "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at a 90-degree angle, partitioning the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. The legs of  one of the triangles are 6 feet and 9 feet, so the hypotenuse of the triangle - which is also the side of the rhombus - is $\\sqrt{(6^2 + 9^2)} = \\sqrt{(36 + 81)} = \\sqrt{117}$ feet. Since $117 = 9 \\times 13$, we can simplify this as follows: $\\sqrt{117} = \\sqrt{(9 \\times 13)} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{13} = 3\\sqrt{13}$ feet. The perimeter of the rhombus is four times this amount or $4 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\boxed{12\\sqrt{13}\\text{ feet}}$."
