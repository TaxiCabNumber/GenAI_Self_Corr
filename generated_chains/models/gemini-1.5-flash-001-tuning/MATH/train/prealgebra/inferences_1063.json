At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than $250$ are multiples of $5$, but not multiples of $10$?",

They have a units digit of $5$.\n\nThe largest number below $250$ with a units digit of $5$ is $245$.  All of these multiples are in the form $\\_\\_5$, where the blank can be filled with an integer between $0$ and $24$, inclusive.  Therefore our answer is the number of integers between $0$ and $24$.
