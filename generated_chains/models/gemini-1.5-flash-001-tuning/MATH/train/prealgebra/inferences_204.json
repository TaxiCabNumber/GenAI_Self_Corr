At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree positive integers have an arithmetic mean of 26 and median of 27. If the median is 5 less than the largest number, what is the smallest number?",
        "inference": "Let the three numbers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a < b < c$.  We know that $b = 27$ and $c = b + 5 = 32$.  Since the arithmetic mean is 26, we have  \\[\\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 26.\\]Substituting, we get  \\[\\frac{a + 27 + 32}{3} = 26.\\]Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{19}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The median of three integers is the middle integer. So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$. We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\\times3=78$. We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\\boxed{19}$."
