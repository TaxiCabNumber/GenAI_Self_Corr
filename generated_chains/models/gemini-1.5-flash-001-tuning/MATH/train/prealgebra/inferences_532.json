At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a bag with only red, blue, and green marbles.  The ratio of red marbles to blue marbles to green marbles is $1:5:3$.  There are 27 green marbles in the bag.  How many marbles are there  in the bag?",

Since the green marbles are one-third of the total, and there are 27 green marbles, there must be $3\\cdot 27 = \\boxed{81}$ total marbles."
