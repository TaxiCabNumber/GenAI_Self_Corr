        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?",
        "inference": "The smallest multiple of 3 greater than 62 is 63, and the largest multiple of 3 less than 215 is 213. The multiples of 3 between 63 and 213 form an arithmetic sequence with first term 63, common difference 3, and last term 213.  To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.  Substituting, we have $213 = 63 + (n-1)3$, which simplifies to $n = 51$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{51}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first multiple of $3$ that is greater than $62$ is $63$, and the last multiple of $3$ that is less than $215$ is $213$. We're only interested in numbers that are divisible by $3$, and the list of such numbers is $$63, 66, 69, \\ldots, 210, 213.$$ To count the number of numbers in this list, first divide each by $3$. Our list then becomes $$21, 22, 23, \\ldots, 70, 71.$$ Finally, subtract $20$ from each number, and the list becomes $$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50, 51.$$ Thus, there are $\\boxed{51}$ multiples of $3$ between $62$ and $215$."
