At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMalcolm can run a race at a speed of 6 minutes per mile, while Joshua runs at 8 minutes per mile. In a 10-mile race, how many minutes after Malcolm crosses the finish line will Joshua cross the finish line if they start the race together?",
