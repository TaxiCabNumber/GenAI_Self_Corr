At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen families have an average of 2 children per family. If exactly two of these families are childless, what is the average number of children in the families with children? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

Since two families are childless, the remaining eight families have 20 children.\nThus, the average number of children in the families with children is $20/8=2.5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
