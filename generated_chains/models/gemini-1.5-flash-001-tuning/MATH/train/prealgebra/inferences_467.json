        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangular playground exceeds twice its width by 25 feet, and the perimeter of the playground is 650 feet. What is the area of the playground in square feet?",
        "inference": "Let $w$ be the width of the playground and $l$ be the length. We are given that $l=2w+25$ and $2l+2w=650$. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we have $2(2w+25)+2w=650$. Expanding the left side of the equation, we have $4w+50+2w=650$. Combining like terms, we have $6w+50=650$. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we have $6w=600$. Dividing both sides by 6, we have $w=100$. Substituting this value of $w$ back into the equation $l=2w+25$, we have $l=2(100)+25=225$. The area of the playground is $lw=(100)(225)=\\boxed{22500}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{22500}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the width of the rectangular playground is $w$, then the length is $2w + 25$. A perimeter of 650 feet means the semi-perimeter is 325 feet. The width plus the length equals the semi-perimeter, so $w + 2w + 25 = 325$. That means $3w = 300$, so $w = 100$ feet. The length must be $2 \\times 100 + 25 =\n225$. The area of the playground is $100 \\times 225 = \\boxed{22,500}$ square feet."
