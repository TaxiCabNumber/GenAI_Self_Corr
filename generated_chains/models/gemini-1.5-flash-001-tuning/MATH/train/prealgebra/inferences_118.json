At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is increased by $25\\%$, but the width of the rectangle is decreased to keep the area of the rectangle  unchanged.  By what percent was the rectangle's width  decreased?",
        "inference": "Let the original length be $l$ and the original width be $w$.  The original area is $lw$.  The new length is $1.25l$, and the new width is $w'$.  Since the area is unchanged, we have $1.25lw' = lw$, so $w' = \\frac{lw}{1.25lw} = \\frac{4}{5}w$.  The width was decreased by $\\frac{1}{5}w$, which is $20\\%$ of the original width. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
