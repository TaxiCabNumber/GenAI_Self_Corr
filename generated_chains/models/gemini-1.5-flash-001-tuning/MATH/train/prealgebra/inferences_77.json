        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA tank is to be filled with water. When the tank is one-sixth full, 130 gallons of water are added, making the tank three-fifths full. How many gallons does the tank contain when it is completely full?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the total capacity of the tank. The tank is one-sixth full when it has $\\frac{1}{6}x$ gallons. After adding 130 gallons, the tank is three-fifths full, or $\\frac{3}{5}x$ gallons. Therefore, we have the equation $\\frac{1}{6}x+130=\\frac{3}{5}x$.\n\nSolving for $x$ we have: $\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{1}{6}x=130 \\Rightarrow \\frac{13}{30}x=130 \\Rightarrow x=\\frac{130\\cdot30}{13}=300$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{300}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The difference between three-fifths full and one-sixth full is $\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity.  Let $x$ be the capacity of the tank in gallons.  Since $\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity is 130 gallons, we have $\\frac{13}{30}x = 130$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{30}{13}$ gives $x = 300$, so the capacity is $\\boxed{300}$ gallons."
