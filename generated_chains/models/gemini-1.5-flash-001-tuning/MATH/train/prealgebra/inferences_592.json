At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 40-foot by 10-foot rectangular garden is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same amount of fencing, its shape is changed to a square. How many square feet larger than the old garden is the new garden?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{100}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The original garden has an area of $40\\cdot 10=400\\text{ ft}^2$. Its perimeter is $40+10+40+10=100\\text{ ft}$, so a square fence using the same amount of fencing has sides of length $25\\text{ ft}$ and an area of $25\\cdot 25 = 625\\text{ ft}^2$. The increase in area is thus $625 - 400 = \\boxed{225}$ square feet."
