        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMoore's law says that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on a silicon chip doubles every two years. In 1990, a typical CPU contained about $1,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors. According to Moore's law, how many transistors did a typical CPU contain in the year 2000?",
        "inference": "The number of transistors doubles every 2 years, so there were $2 \\times 1,\\!000,\\!000 = 2,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors in 1992, $2 \\times 2,\\!000,\\!000 = 4,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors in 1994, and so on.\nThe number of transistors doubles 5 times between 1990 and 2000. Therefore, in 2000, a typical CPU contained $2^5 \\times 1,\\!000,\\!000 = 32,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32,000,000}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "$2000-1990 = 10$ years passed between the years $1990$ and $2000$, during which the number of transistors doubled $10 \\div 2 = 5$ times. Doubling a number five times means multiplying it by two raised to the fifth power. Thus we carry out the multiplication to get our answer: \\[1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 2^5 = 1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{32,\\!000,\\!000} \\text{ transistors}.\\]"
