At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe complement of an angle is $5^{\\circ}$ more than four times the angle. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the angle?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the measure of the angle.  The complement of the angle is $90-x$.  We are given that $90-x = 4x+5$.  Solving for $x$, we get $85 = 5x$, so $x = 17$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\\circ$.  Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\\circ) = 90^\\circ$.  Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\\circ = 90^\\circ$, so $5x = 85^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{17^\\circ}$."
