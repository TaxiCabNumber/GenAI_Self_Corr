At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKenton watched 2000 adult men and women board a cruise ship. Half of the adults were women. If 20$\\%$ of the women and 9$\\%$ of the men were wearing sunglasses, what was the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n* **Women on the ship:** Half the adults were women, so there were 2000 / 2 = 1000 women.\n* **Women wearing sunglasses:** 20% of the women were wearing sunglasses, so 1000 * 0.20 = 200 women were wearing sunglasses.\n* **Men on the ship:** There were 2000 - 1000 = 1000 men.\n* **Men wearing sunglasses:** 9% of the men were wearing sunglasses, so 1000 * 0.09 = 90 men were wearing sunglasses.\n* **Total sunglasses:** In total, 200 + 90 = 290 people were wearing sunglasses.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{290}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men.  Thus, $20\\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses."
