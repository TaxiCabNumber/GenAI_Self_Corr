At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

A right triangle consists of a right angle of $90^\\circ$ and two acute angles that add up to $90^\\circ$, so each of the two acute angles is smaller than the right angle. Also recall that the definition of an acute angle is that its degree measure is less than $90^\\circ$. So the largest angle of the triangle is the right angle, which has a measure of $\\boxed{90^\\circ}$."
