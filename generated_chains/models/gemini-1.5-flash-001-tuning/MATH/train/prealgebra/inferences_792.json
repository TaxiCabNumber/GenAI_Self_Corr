Two bugs start simultaneously from $A$ and crawl along the perimeter of the triangle in opposite directions at the same speed. They meet at point $D$. What is $BD$?",

Therefore, $BD = 6 - x = 6 - 12 = \\boxed{-6}$. Since the length cannot be negative, the answer is $\\boxed{6}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
