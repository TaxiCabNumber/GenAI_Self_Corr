At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the new diameter is 2 times the original diameter, the new area is $2^2=4$ times the old area.  Therefore, the ratio of original area to new area is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
