        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn triangle $ABC$, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $86$ degrees. The measure of $\\angle B$ is $22$ degrees more than three times the measure of $\\angle C$. What is the measure, in degrees, of $\\angle C$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the measure of angle $C$. Then the measure of angle $B$ is $3x+22$. Since the angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have the equation $x + 3x + 22 + 86 = 180$. Combining like terms, we get $4x + 108 = 180$. Subtracting 108 from both sides, we get $4x = 72$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $x = 18$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "In a triangle, the degrees of the three angles add up to $180$. We set the degree measure for $\\angle C$ to be $x$. Therefore, the angle measure for $\\angle B$ is $3x+22$. We add all of the degrees together to $180$. Then we have: \\begin{align*}\n86+3x+22+x &= 180 \\\\\n108+4x &= 180 \\\\\n4x &= 72 \\\\\nx &= 18.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have that the degree measure of $\\angle C$ is $\\boxed{18 \\text{ degrees}}$."
