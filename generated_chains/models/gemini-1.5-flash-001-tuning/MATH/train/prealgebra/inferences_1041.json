        "inference": "We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle.  Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semiperimeter of the triangle (half the perimeter).  In this case, $s = \\frac{4+3+3}{2} = 5$, so the area of the triangle is  \\[\\sqrt{5(5-4)(5-3)(5-3)} = \\sqrt{5\\cdot1\\cdot2\\cdot2} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.\\]\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We have an isosceles triangle with a base of 4 units and legs of 3 units each. We know that with an isosceles triangle, the altitude bisects the base. So drawing the altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two right triangles that share a side (the altitude) and have a leg of half the base. For each of the right triangles, the hypotenuse is 3 units, while one of the legs is 2 units, half of the isosceles triangle's base. We solve for the length of the other leg (the height of the isosceles triangle) with the Pythagorean Theorem: $a^2=c^2-b^2$, so $a^2=3^2-2^2$ and $a=\\sqrt{5}$. Now we know the base of the isosceles triangle is 4 units and the height is $\\sqrt{5}$ units, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(\\sqrt{5})=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$ square units."
