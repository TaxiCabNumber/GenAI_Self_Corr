        "inference": "Let the length of the interior rectangle be $l$ inches and the width be $w$ inches.  Then the outer dimensions of the frame are $l+2$ and $w+2$ inches.  We know that $l+2=5$, so $l=3$.  The area of the frame is $(l+2)(w+2)-lw=18$, so $5(w+2)-3w=18$.  This simplifies to $2w=8$, so $w=4$.  The sum of the lengths of the four interior edges is $2l+2w=2(3)+2(4)=\\boxed{14}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The lengths of the top/bottom interior edges are $5-2=3$ inches (since there is 1 inch of frame to either side of the interior rectangular hole). Let the lengths of the left/right interior edges be $x$ inches. Then, the lengths of the left/right exterior edges are $x+2$ inches. The area of the frame is equal to the area of the frame rectangle minus the area of the hole. This is equal to $5\\cdot(x+2)-3x=2x+10$. Since we are given that this area is 18 square inches, we have the equation $2x+10=18\\Rightarrow x=4$. So the dimensions of the interior hole are $3\\times4$. Thus, the sum of the four interior edges is $3+4+3+4=\\boxed{14}$ inches."
