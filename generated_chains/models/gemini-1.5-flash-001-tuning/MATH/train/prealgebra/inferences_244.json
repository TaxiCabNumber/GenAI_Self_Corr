        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of measures of two complementary angles is 4 to 5. The smallest measure is increased by $10\\%$. By what percent must the larger measure be decreased so that the two angles remain complementary?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nLet the measures of the two angles be $4x$ and $5x$. Since they are complementary, we have $4x + 5x = 90$, so $x = 10$. The two angles measure $40^\\circ$ and $50^\\circ$.  Increasing the smaller angle by $10\\%$ gives us $40 + (0.1)(40) = 44^\\circ$. Since the two angles must still add to $90^\\circ$, the larger angle must be decreased by $6^\\circ$.  This is a decrease of $\\frac{6}{50} \\cdot 100\\% = \\boxed{12\\%}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the ratio of the two complementary angles is 4 to 5, then there are 9 equal parts making up the full 90 degrees. That means each part is 10 degrees, and the two angles are 40 degrees and 50 degrees. When the 40-degree angle is increased by $10\\%$, we get 44 degrees. The 50-degree angle must drop down to 46 so that the two angles remain complementary. Dividing 46 by 50, we get 0.92, or $92\\%$. The larger angle must decrease by $\\boxed{8\\%}$."

The larger angle should be decreased by the same amount that the smaller angle is increased, which is $4^\\circ$.
