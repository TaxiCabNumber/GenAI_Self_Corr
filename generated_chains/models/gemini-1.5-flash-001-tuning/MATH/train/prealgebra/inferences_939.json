I hope it is correct.'\nOn an indoor circular track of circumference 50 feet, Joneal starts at point $S$, runs in a counterclockwise direction, and then stops when he has run exactly one mile (5280 feet).

For the next 12.5 feet after that, he is on the portion of the track marked $B$.  At this point he has traveled $5250+12.5+12.5=5275$ feet.  After traveling the final 5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $\\boxed{C}$."
