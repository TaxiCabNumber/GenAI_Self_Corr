At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stock investment went up $25\\%$ in 2006. Starting at this increased value, what percent would it have to go down in 2007 to be back to its original price at the beginning of 2006?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the original price of the stock.\n\nAfter the $25\\%$ increase in 2006, the price became $x+0.25x=1.25x$.\n\nTo get back to the original price $x$, the price must decrease by $1.25x-x=0.25x$.\n\nThe percent decrease is given by $\\frac{0.25x}{1.25x}\\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{5}\\times 100\\% = 20\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the original price of the stock. This means that the price of the stock is $1.25x$ at the end of 2006. The original price is $\\frac{x}{1.25x} = 80$ percent of this price, so the stock must decrease by $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
