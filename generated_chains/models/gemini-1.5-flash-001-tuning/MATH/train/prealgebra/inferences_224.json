At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPaint is to be mixed so that the ratio of red paint to white paint is 3 to 2. If Ben wants to make 30 cans of the mixture and all cans hold the same volume of paint, how many cans of red paint will he need?",
        "inference": "The ratio of red paint to white paint is 3:2, which means there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts in the mixture.\n\nIf Ben wants to make 30 cans, he needs 30 / 5 = 6 cans per part.\n\nSince red paint makes up 3 parts of the mixture, he needs 3 * 6 = 18 cans of red paint.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $3/(3+2)=3/5$ of the total amount of paint is red, he will need $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot30=\\boxed{18}$ cans of red paint."
