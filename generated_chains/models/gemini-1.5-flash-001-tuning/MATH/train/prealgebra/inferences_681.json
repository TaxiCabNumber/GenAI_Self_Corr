For example, for vertex $A$, we can get right triangles $DAP$ and $DAB$. Since there are four vertices, we can get $2 \\cdot 4 =8$ right triangles.\n\nNext, we consider triangles that have $P$ or $Q$ as the vertices. We can set $PQ$ as a leg of the right triangles and get $4$ right triangles with the third vertex $A,B,C$, and $D$.\n\nLastly, we can draw the diagonals $DP, CP, AQ$, and $BQ$. Since $ADQP$ and $BCQP$ are squares, each diagonal creates a $45$ degree angle with the line segment $PQ$. Therefore, we have two right triangles: $DPC$ and $AQB$.\n\nAdding them together, we have a total of $$8+4+2=\\boxed{14 \\text{ right triangles}}.$$"
