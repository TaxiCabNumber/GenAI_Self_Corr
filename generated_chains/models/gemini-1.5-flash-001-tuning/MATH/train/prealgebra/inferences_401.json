At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree measure of an angle whose measure is double the measure of its complement?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of the angle.  Then its complement has measure $90-x$.  We are given that $x=2(90-x)$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=60$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Two angles are complementary if their degree measures add up to 90 degrees. So if the angle is $x$ degrees, then its complement is $90-x$ degrees. We set up the equation $x=2(90-x)$ and solve for $x$. $$x=180-2x\\qquad\\Rightarrow3x=180\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=60$$So the angle has a degree measure of $\\boxed{60}$ degrees."
