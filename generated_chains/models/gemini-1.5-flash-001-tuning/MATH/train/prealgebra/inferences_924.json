At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $a$ does the equation $3(2x-a) = 2(3x+12)$ have infinitely many solutions $x$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: $\\boxed{-8}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Distributing on both sides gives $6x-3a = 6x+24$.  Subtracting $6x$ from both sides gives $-3a=24$.  If $a=\\boxed{-8}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $x$ (and so has infinitely many solutions).  Otherwise, the equation is never true, so the original equation has no solutions."
