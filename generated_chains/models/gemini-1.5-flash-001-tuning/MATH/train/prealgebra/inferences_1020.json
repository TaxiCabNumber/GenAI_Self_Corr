At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMargaret started a stamp collection. She collected 8 stamps the first day. Each subsequent day she collected 8 more stamps than she had collected the previous day. If she collected stamps for 5 consecutive days, what was the average number of stamps collected per day?",
