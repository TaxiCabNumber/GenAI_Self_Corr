We are given that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800$, so $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$.  This simplifies to $2c^2 = 1800$, so $c^2 = 900$.  Therefore, $c = \\sqrt{900} = 30$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$.

We are told that $$a^2+b^2+c^2 = 1800.$$ Since $a^2+b^2=c^2$, then $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$ or $2c^2 = 1800$ or $c^2 = 900$ or $c=30$ (since the side lengths are positive).

        "inference": "The error is that the solution uses the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800$ without justification.  The problem does not give us this information.\n\nHere's how to solve the problem correctly:\n\nWe are given that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (Pythagorean Theorem) and $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1800$.  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $c^2 + c^2 = 1800$, which simplifies to $2c^2 = 1800$.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $c^2 = 900$, so $c = \\sqrt{900} = 30$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
