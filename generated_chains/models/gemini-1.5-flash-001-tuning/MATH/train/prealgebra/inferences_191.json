The perimeter of one of the rectangles is $s+\\frac{s}{5}+s+\\frac{s}{5}=\\frac{12}{5}s$.  Setting $\\frac{12}{5}s=36$ inches, we find $s=15$ inches.

        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that the square's side length is $5w$. There's no information provided to support that.  \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet the length of each rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. The perimeter of each rectangle is $2l + 2w = 36$, so $l + w = 18$.  The side length of the square is equal to the width of the rectangle, which is $w$. The perimeter of the square is $4w$. \n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the square is $\\boxed{4w}$. \n",
