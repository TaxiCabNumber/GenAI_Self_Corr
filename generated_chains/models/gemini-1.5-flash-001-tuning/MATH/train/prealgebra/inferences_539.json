At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConvex hexagon $ABCDEF$ has exactly two distinct side lengths. Side $AB$ measures 5 units, and side $BC$ measures 6 units. The perimeter of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 34 units. How many sides of hexagon $ABCDEF$ have measure 6 units?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If all sides measured $6$ units, the total perimeter would be $36$.  But this is $2$ too many units, so we must change two of these sides to $5$ units.  Thus $\\boxed{4}$ sides measure $6$ units."
