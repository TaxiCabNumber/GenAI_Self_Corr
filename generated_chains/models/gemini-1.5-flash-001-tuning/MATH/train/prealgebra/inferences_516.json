        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Central Middle School the $108$ students who take the AMC 8 meet in the evening to talk about problems and eat an average of two cookies apiece. Walter and Gretel are baking Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies this year. Their recipe, which makes a pan of $15$ cookies, lists these items:\n\n$\\bullet$ $1\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour\n\n$\\bullet$ $2$ eggs\n\n$\\bullet$ $3$ tablespoons butter\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac{3}{4}$ cups sugar\n\n$\\bullet$ $1$ package of chocolate drops\n\nThey will make only full recipes, no partial recipes.\n\nThey learn that a big concert is scheduled for the same night and attendance will be down $25\\%.$ How many recipes of cookies should they make for their smaller party?",
        "inference": "The AMC 8 attendance will be down by $25\\% \\cdot 108 = 27$ students. So, $108 - 27 = 81$ students will attend.  Each student eats 2 cookies, so they will need $81 \\cdot 2 = 162$ cookies.  They get 15 cookies per recipe, so they need to make $162/15 = \\boxed{10\\frac{4}{5}}$ recipes.  Since they can only make full recipes, they need to make **11** recipes. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The $108\\cdot 0.75=81$ students need $2$ cookies each so $162$ cookies are to be baked. Since $162\\div 15=10.8,$ Walter and Gretel must bake $\\boxed{11}$ recipes. A few leftovers are a good thing!"
