At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$, what is $F$ when $C=20$?",

We could distribute on the right-hand side, but it's a bit faster to divide both sides by 5, giving $36 = F-32$.  Adding 32 to both sides gives $F = \\boxed{68}$."
