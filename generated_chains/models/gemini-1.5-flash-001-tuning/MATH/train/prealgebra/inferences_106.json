At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA jar contains $29\\frac{5}{7}$ tablespoons of peanut butter. If one serving of peanut butter is 2 tablespoons, how many servings of peanut butter does the jar contain? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "First, convert the mixed number $29\\frac{5}{7}$ to an improper fraction: $29\\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{29\\cdot7 + 5}{7} = \\frac{208}{7}$.\n\nNext, divide the total amount of peanut butter by the size of one serving: $\\frac{208}{7} \\div 2 = \\frac{208}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{104}{7}$.\n\nFinally, convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number: $\\frac{104}{7} = 14 \\frac{6}{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14 \\frac{6}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The jar contains $29\\frac{5}{7}\\div 2$ servings of peanut butter. Recalling that $a\\div b=\\frac{a}{b}$, we get $$29\\frac{5}{7}\\div 2=29\\frac{5}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{208}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{104}{7}=14\\frac{6}{7}.$$The jar contains $\\boxed{14\\frac{6}{7}}$ servings of peanut butter."
