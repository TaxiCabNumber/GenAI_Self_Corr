        "ground_truth": "Carrying out prime factorization, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$ and $81=3^4$. Taking the least power of each prime that appears in these two factorizations, we find that the greatest common divisor is $2^0\\cdot3^1\\cdot 5^0=3$. Taking the highest power of each prime that appears , we find that the least common multiple of $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$ and $12=2^2\\cdot3$ is $2^2\\cdot3^2=36$. Their sum is $3+36=\\boxed{39}$."
