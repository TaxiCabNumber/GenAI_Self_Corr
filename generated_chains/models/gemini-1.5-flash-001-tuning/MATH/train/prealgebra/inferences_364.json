At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nApples are sold at the farmer's market at a rate of $\\$4$ per five pounds. According to this rate, how many dollars does it cost to buy 15 pounds of apples?",

        "ground_truth": "We have the ratio $5 \\text{ pounds}:\\$4$. Multiplying both sides of the ratio by 3 does not change the ratio. Doing so, we get $15 \\text{ pounds}:\\$12$. Thus, 15 pounds of apples costs $\\boxed{12}$ dollars."
