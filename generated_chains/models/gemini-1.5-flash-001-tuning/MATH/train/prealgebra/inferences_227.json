        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a circle is $49\\pi$ square units. What is the radius of the circle, in units?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the area is $49\\pi$ square units. So, we can set up the equation $49\\pi = \\pi r^2$. Dividing both sides by $\\pi$ gives us $49 = r^2$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $r = 7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of a circle is $\\pi \\cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot r^2 = 49\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\\boxed{7}$ units."
