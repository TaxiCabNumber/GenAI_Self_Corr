At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe trip from Carville to Nikpath requires $4\\frac 12$ hours when traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour. How many hours does the trip require when traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
