        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn convex pentagon $ABCDE$, angles $A$, $B$ and $C$ are congruent and angles $D$ and $E$ are congruent. If the measure of angle $A$ is 40 degrees less than the measure of angle $D$, what is the measure of angle $D$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of angle $D$ and $E$.  Then the measure of angle $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $x - 40$.  Since the angles of a pentagon add up to $540^\\circ$, we have  \\[3(x - 40) + 2x = 540.\\] Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\boxed{96}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{96}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of $\\angle A$ be $x$, so we have $\\angle B = x$ and $\\angle C=x$, too. Since $\\angle A$ is $40^\\circ$ less than $\\angle D$, we have $\\angle D = x + 40^\\circ$, so $\\angle E = x+40^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we have \\[x + x + x + (x+40^\\circ) + (x+40^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x + 80^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, so $5x = 460^\\circ$ and $x = 92^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle D = \\angle A + 40^\\circ = \\boxed{132^\\circ}$."

We are not told anything about the angles of the pentagon, only that angles $D$ and $E$ are equal and that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all $40^\\circ$ less than $D$ and $E$.
