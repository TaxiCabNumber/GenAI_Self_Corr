At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of irises to roses in Nikki's garden is 2:5. She currently has 25 roses. She is planning to add 20 more roses and enough irises to keep the same ratio. How many irises will she have in total after this addition?",
