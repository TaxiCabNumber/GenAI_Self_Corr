At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a water tank is $30\\%$ full, it contains 27 gallons less than when it is $20\\%$ empty. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when it is full?",

        "ground_truth": "$20\\%$ empty is the same thing as $80\\%$ full.  Thus, 27 gallons represents the difference between $80\\%$ and $30\\%$ of the tank, meaning that 27 gallons is $50\\%$ of the tank.  Since half the tank is 27 gallons, the entire tank can hold $\\boxed{54\\text{ gallons}}$."
