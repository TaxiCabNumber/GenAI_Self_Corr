At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy co-worker Larry only likes numbers that are divisible by 4, such as 20, or 4,004.  How many different ones digits are possible in numbers that Larry likes?",
