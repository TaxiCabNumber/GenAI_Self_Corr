        "inference": "A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. \n\n* **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. \n* **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $2345N$ is $2+3+4+5+N = 14+N$.  The largest possible value of $N$ is 9.  Since $14+9=23$ is not divisible by 3, we must try a smaller value of $N$.  The next largest possible value of $N$ is 8.  Since $14+8=22$ is not divisible by 3, we must try a smaller value of $N$.  The next largest possible value of $N$ is 7.

We see that $N + 14$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $N$ is one of the digits 1, 4, or 7.\n\nTherefore, there is in fact only one digit $N$ for which $2345N$ is divisible by 6, namely $N = \\boxed{4}$."
