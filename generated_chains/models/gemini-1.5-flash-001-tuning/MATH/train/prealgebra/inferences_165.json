At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI flip a fair coin once and roll a regular six-sided die.  What is the probability the coin will show heads and the die will show a 2?",

Only 1 of these is a successful outcome: the coin must show heads and the die must show 2.  So the probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
