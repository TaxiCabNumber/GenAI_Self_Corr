At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAcme T-Shirt Company charges a $\\$50$ set-up fee plus $\\$9$ for  each shirt printed. Beta T-shirt Company has no set up fee, but charges $\\$14$ per shirt. What is the minimum number of shirts for which a customer saves money by using Acme?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of shirts.  We want to find the smallest $x$ such that the cost at Acme is less than the cost at Beta.  This gives us the inequality:\n\n$$50 + 9x < 14x$$\n\nSubtracting $9x$ from both sides gives $50<5x$. Dividing both sides by 5 gives $10<x$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We want to find the lowest integer $x$ such that: \\begin{align*}\n50+9x&<14x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n50&<5x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n10&<x.\n\\end{align*}The least integer greater than 10 is $\\boxed{11}$."
