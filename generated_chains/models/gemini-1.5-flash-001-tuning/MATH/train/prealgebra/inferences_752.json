At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the prime factorization of $24!$, what is the exponent of $3$?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",

We've already counted them one each, so we need to count them each one more time. This adds another $2$ to the exponent.\n\nThe next thing to check is whether any of the numbers have $3$ as a factor three times. Happily, $3^3=27>24$, so we don't have any of those.\n\nOur total exponent is $8+2=\\boxed{10}$."
