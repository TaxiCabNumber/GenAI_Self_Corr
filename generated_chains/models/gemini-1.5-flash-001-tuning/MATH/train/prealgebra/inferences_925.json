I hope it is correct.'\nRoger has exactly one of each of the first 22 states' new U.S.  quarters.  The quarters were released in the same order that the  states joined the union.  The graph below shows the number of  states that joined the union in each decade.  What fraction of  Roger's 22 coins represents states that joined the union during  the decade 1780 through 1789?
