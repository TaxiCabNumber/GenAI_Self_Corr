At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ''roundness'' of an integer greater than 1 is the sum of the exponents of the prime factorization of the number. For example, $20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1$, so 20 has a roundness of 3. What is the roundness of 1,000,000?",
