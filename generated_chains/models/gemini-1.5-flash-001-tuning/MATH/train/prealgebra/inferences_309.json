Then, the five angles have measures $x -2^\\circ$, $x-1^\\circ$, $x$, $x + 1^\\circ$, and $x+2^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so \\[(x -2^\\circ)+(x-1^\\circ)+(x)+(x + 1^\\circ) +(x+2^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x = 540^\\circ$, and dividing both sides by 5 gives $x = 108^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $x + 2^\\circ = \\boxed{110^\\circ}$."
