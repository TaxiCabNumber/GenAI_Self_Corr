        "inference": "The error is that the problem does not specify that there are an equal number of each type of coin.  We need to use variables to represent the number of each type of coin.  Let $n$ be the number of nickels, $d$ be the number of dimes, and $q$ be the number of quarters.  We are given the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25q &= 13.20\\\\\nn + d + q &= 80\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve for $n$ in the second equation to get $n = 80 - d - q$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$0.05(80-d-q) + 0.10d + 0.25q = 13.20$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$4 - 0.05d - 0.05q + 0.10d + 0.25q = 13.20$$\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n$$0.05d + 0.20q = 9.20$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 20, we get:\n\n$$d + 4q = 184$$\n\nWe can now solve for $d$ in terms of $q$:\n\n$$d = 184 - 4q$$\n\nSubstituting this into the equation $n + d + q = 80$, we get:\n\n$$n + 184 - 4q + q = 80$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$n - 3q = -104$$\n\nWe can now solve for $n$ in terms of $q$:\n\n$$n = 3q - 104$$\n\nSince $n$, $d$, and $q$ must be integers, we can try different values of $q$ until we find a solution where all three variables are integers.  If we try $q = 24$, we get $n = 12$ and $d = 32$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{12}$ nickels, $\\boxed{32}$ dimes, and $\\boxed{24}$ quarters. \n",
