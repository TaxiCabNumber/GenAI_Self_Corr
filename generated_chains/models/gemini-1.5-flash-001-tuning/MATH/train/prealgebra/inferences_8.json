        "inference": "Let $x=0.\\overline{3}$ and $y=0.\\overline{2}$. Then $10x=3.\\overline{3}$ and $10y=2.\\overline{2}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we have $9x=3$, so $x=\\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, subtracting $y$ from $10y$ gives $9y=2$, so $y=\\frac{2}{9}$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{3}+0.\\overline{2}=x+y=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 39 + \\frac 29 = \\boxed{\\frac 59}$."
