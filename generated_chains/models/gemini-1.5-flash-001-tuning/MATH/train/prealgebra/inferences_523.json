At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer value of $x$ for which $5-4x>17$?",

        "ground_truth": "Adding $4x$ to both sides, we have $5 > 17+4x$. Then, subtracting $17$ from both sides, we have $-12 > 4x$. Finally, dividing both sides by $4$, we have $-3 > x$. This inequality states that $x$ is strictly less than $-3$. The largest integer satisfying that condition is $\\boxed{-4}$."
