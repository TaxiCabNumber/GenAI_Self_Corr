At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has legs measuring 20 inches and 21 inches. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in inches?",

        "ground_truth": "Say the hypotenuse has length $h$ inches. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $h^2=20^2+21^2=400+441=841$, so $h=\\sqrt{841}=29$. The length is thus $\\boxed{29}$ inches."
