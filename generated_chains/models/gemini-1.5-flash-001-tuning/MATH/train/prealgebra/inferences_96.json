At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same?",

There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails.  There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter.  So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{8}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
