At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenny places a total of 18 red Easter eggs in several green baskets and a total of 24 orange Easter eggs in some blue baskets.  Each basket contains the same number of eggs and there are at least 4 eggs in each basket.  How many eggs did Jenny put in each basket?",
