        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rhombus has an area of 108 square units. The lengths of its diagonals have a ratio of 3 to 2. What is the length of the longest diagonal, in units?",
        "inference": "Let the lengths of the diagonals be $3x$ and $2x$.  The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals, so \\[\\frac{1}{2}(3x)(2x)=108.\\] Simplifying, we have $3x^2=108$, so $x^2=36$.  Since $x$ is positive, $x=6$.  The longer diagonal has length $3x=3(6)=\\boxed{18}$ units. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the diagonals have length $3x$ and $2x$. Half the product of the diagonals of a rhombus is equal to the area, so $(2x)(3x)/2= 108$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 6$. Therefore, the length of the longest diagonal is $3x = \\boxed{18}$."
