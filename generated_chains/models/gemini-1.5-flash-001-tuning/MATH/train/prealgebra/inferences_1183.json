        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSarah's bowling score was 40 points more than Greg's, and the average of their two scores was 102. What was Sarah's score? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2.)",
        "inference": "Let Greg's score be $g$ and Sarah's score be $s$. We know that $s = g + 40$ and $\\frac{s+g}{2}=102$.  We can substitute $s = g + 40$ into the second equation to get $\\frac{g + 40 + g}{2}=102$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{2g + 40}{2}=102$, which gives us $g + 20 = 102$.  Subtracting $20$ from both sides, we get $g = 82$.  Substituting this value into $s=g+40$ gives us $s = 82 + 40 = 122$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{122}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The average of their scores is halfway between their scores.  Thus, since their scores differ by 40, and Sarah's score is higher, her score is $102+\\frac{40}{2} = \\boxed{122}$.\n\nYou can do this more precisely by calling Sarah's score $x$, and Greg's score is therefore $x - 40$.  Taking an average: $x - 20 = 102$, and thus, $x = 122$."
