        "inference": "The error is in assuming you can choose the left and right sides independently. You need to consider the length of the rectangle.  Here's the correct solution:\n\n* **Possible lengths:**  You have 3 possible lengths for the rectangle (since there are 4 vertical lines, you have 3 gaps between them).\n* **Possible heights:** For each length, you have 3 possible heights (since there are 4 horizontal lines, you have 3 gaps between them).\n\nTherefore, there are 3 * 3 = **9** possible rectangles. \n\n**\\boxed{9}** \n",
