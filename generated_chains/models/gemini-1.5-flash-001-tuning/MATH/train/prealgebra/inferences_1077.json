At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrew and John are both Beatles fans.  Their respective collections share nine of the same albums.  Andrew has seventeen albums in his collection.  Six albums are in John's collection, but not Andrew's.
