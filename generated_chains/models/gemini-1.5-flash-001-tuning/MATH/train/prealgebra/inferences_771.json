At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery June 1, an ecologist takes a census of the number of wrens in a state park. She noticed that the number is decreasing by $40\\%$ each year. If this trend continues, in what year will the census show that the number of wrens is less than $10\\%$ of what it was on June 1, 2004?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{2010}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "After one year, there will be $60\\%$ left. After two years, there will be $36\\%$ left. After three years, there will be $21.6\\%$ left.\n\nAs we can see, these are just increasing powers of $60\\%$, the next year will not dip below $10\\%$, because $60\\% > 50\\%$, and $21.6 > 20$.  However, without calculating it exactly, you know that it will be less than $16.6\\%$, and thus, it will take 5 years - meaning that in $\\boxed{2009}$, the total number of wrens will drop below $10\\%$ of what it originally was."
