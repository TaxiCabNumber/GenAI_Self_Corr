At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI take variable $b$, double it, and add four.  I subtract $4b$ from this new expression, and divide the resulting difference by two.  What is my final expression in simplest form?",
