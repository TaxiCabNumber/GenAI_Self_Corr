At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA five-digit integer will be chosen at random from all possible positive five-digit integers. What is the probability that the number's units digit will be less than 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
