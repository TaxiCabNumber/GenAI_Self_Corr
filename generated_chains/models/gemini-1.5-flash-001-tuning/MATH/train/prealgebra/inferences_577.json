At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive factors of 96 are also multiples of 12?",

We see which factors are divisible by 12, because if they are divisible by 12 then they are multiples of 12. We can check them each: 1 is not, 2 is not, 3 is not, 4 is not, 6 is not, 8 is not, 12 is, 16 is not, 24 is, 32 is not, 48 is, and 96 is.
