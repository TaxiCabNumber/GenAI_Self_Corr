At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (1.5 cm);\n\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nfilldraw(arc((1,1),1,270,180)--arc((-1,1),1,360,270)--arc((-1,-1),1,90,0)--arc((1,-1),1,180,90)--cycle,gray);\n[/asy]",

        "ground_truth": "We first notice that the area of the shaded region is the area of the square minus the areas of the four quarter circles. Each quarter circle has a radius half the side length, so if we sum the areas of the four quarter circles, we have the area of one full circle with radius $5$ cm. Now, we know the area of a square is the square of its side length, so the square has an area of $100 \\text{ cm}^2$. A circle has an area of $\\pi$ times its radius squared, so the four quarter circles combined have an area of $\\pi(5)^2=25\\pi \\text{ cm}^2$. From this, we know that the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{100-25\\pi} \\text{ cm}^2$."
