        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the probability of earning a B.  Then the probability of earning an A is $0.7x$ and the probability of earning a C is $1.4x$.  Since the probabilities of all grades must add up to 1, we have $0.7x + x + 1.4x = 1$.  Combining like terms, we get $3.1x = 1$, so $x = \\frac{1}{3.1}$.  Thus, the probability of earning a B is $\\frac{1}{3.1}$.  Since there are 31 students in the class, the number of B's is $31 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3.1} = \\boxed{10}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$."

        "inference": "The error is that the probabilities of earning A, B, and C don't add up to 1. We need to normalize them by dividing each probability by the sum of all probabilities. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe sum of probabilities is $0.7x + x + 1.4x = 3.1x$.  To normalize, we divide each probability by $3.1x$:\n\n* Probability of A: $\\frac{0.7x}{3.1x} = \\frac{7}{31}$\n* Probability of B: $\\frac{x}{3.1x} = \\frac{10}{31}$\n* Probability of C: $\\frac{1.4x}{3.1x} = \\frac{14}{31}$\n\nTherefore, the number of B's is $31 \\cdot \\frac{10}{31} = \\boxed{10}$. \n",
