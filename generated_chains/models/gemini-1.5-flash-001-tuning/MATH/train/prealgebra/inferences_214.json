At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a set of five consecutive integers, the largest integer is less than twice the average of the five integers. What is the smallest integer that could be in the set?",
        "inference": "Let the five consecutive integers be $n$, $n + 1$, $n + 2$, $n + 3$, and $n + 4$.  The average of these integers is $\\frac{n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) + (n + 4)}{5} = n + 2$.  We are given that $n + 4 < 2(n + 2)$.  Solving for $n$, we find $n > 0$.  Since $n$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{1}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$ and $n+4$.  Their average is $n+2$, so we have $$n+4<2(n+2) \\Rightarrow n+4<2n+4 \\Rightarrow 0<n.$$Thus $n$ is at least $\\boxed{1}$."
