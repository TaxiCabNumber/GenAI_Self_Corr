        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular field is half as wide as it is long, and it is completely enclosed by 54 meters of fencing. What is the number of square meters in the area of the field?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the field be $l$ meters.  Then the width is $\\frac{l}{2}$ meters.  The perimeter of the field is $2l+2\\cdot\\frac{l}{2}=3l$ meters.  Since the perimeter is 54 meters, we have $3l=54$, so $l=18$.  The width of the field is $\\frac{18}{2}=9$ meters.  The area of the field is $18\\cdot9=162$ square meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{162}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the rectangle's width be $w$, then its length is $2w$.  So its perimeter is $2(w + 2w) = 6w = 54$.  Thus $w = 9$, and the rectangle's area is $9(2\\cdot 9) = \\boxed{162}$ square meters."
