At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA car is averaging 50 miles per hour. If the car maintains this speed, how many minutes less would a 450-mile trip take than a 475-mile trip?",

        "ground_truth": "The trip would be $475-450 = 25$ miles less, and it takes 30 minutes to travel 25 miles at 50 mph, (25 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of 50, and thus, it takes $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an hour) therefore, it would be $\\boxed{30}$ minutes less."
