At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of a game, each of the five members of a basketball team shake hands with each of the five members of the other team, and all of the players shake hands with the two referees. How many handshakes occur?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n- There are 5 players on each team, so there are 5 * 5 = 25 handshakes between the players of the two teams.\n- There are 2 referees, and each of the 10 players shakes their hand, for a total of 2 * 10 = 20 handshakes.\n- In total, there are 25 + 20 = 45 handshakes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider the five members of one team shaking hands with each of the five members of the other team, we can simply count the number of hands the members of one team shake, since this will necessarily count all of the handshakes of the other team. Thus, as each of the five people shakes five hands, this gives $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ handshakes. There are ten basketball players total, and if each shakes hands with two referees, this gives $10 \\cdot 2 = 20$ more handshakes. Thus, a total of $25 + 20 = \\boxed{45}$ handshakes occur."
