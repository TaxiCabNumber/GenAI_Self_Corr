At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
        "inference": "The average of 23 and $x$ is $(23+x)/2$, which equals 27.  So $(23+x)/2 = 27$.  Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $23+x=54$.  Subtracting 23 from both sides gives $x=31$.  The positive difference between 23 and $x$ is $31-23=8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.
