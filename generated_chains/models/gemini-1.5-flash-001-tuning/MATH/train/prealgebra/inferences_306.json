At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo bake $12$ cookies, I use $2$ quarts of milk. There are $2$ pints in a quart. How many pints of milk do I need to bake $3$ cookies?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{3}{2}$}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, convert quarts to pints. $1$ quart is $2$ pints, so $2$ quarts is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ pints. So, it takes $4$ pints of milk to bake $12$ cookies. Because the proportion of milk to cookies is constant, divide both the pints of milk and the number of cookies by $4$ to obtain that $\\boxed{1}$ pint of milk is needed to bake $3$ cookies."
