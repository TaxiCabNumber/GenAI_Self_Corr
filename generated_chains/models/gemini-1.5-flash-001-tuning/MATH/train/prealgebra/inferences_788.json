At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive two-digit integers are multiples of 5 and of 7?",

        "ground_truth": "Since 5 and 7 share no factors other than 1, any number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 must be a multiple of $5\\cdot7=35$. Thus, we want to find how many 2-digit integers are multiples of 35. The only two-digit multiples of 35 are 35 and 70, so our answer is $\\boxed{2}$ integers."
