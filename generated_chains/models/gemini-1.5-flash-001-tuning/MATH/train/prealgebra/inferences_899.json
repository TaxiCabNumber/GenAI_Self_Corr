At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The largest single-digit number is $9$, which can be found by $3^2$. This leaves us $7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2^4$. We can get the next largest number, $8$, by using $2^3$. This leaves $7 \\cdot 5\\cdot 2$. We can't multiply any of those numbers together to get a single-digit number, so we have that the remaining three digits are $7,5$, and $2$. Ordering the digits from largest to smallest, we get $\\boxed{98752}$."
