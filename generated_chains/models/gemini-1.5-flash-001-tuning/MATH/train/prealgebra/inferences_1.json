At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of 32ft.",
        "inference": "The perimeter of a square is equal to 4 times the length of a side.  So, the length of one side of the square is 32ft/4 = 8ft.  The area of a square is equal to the side length squared.  Thus, the area of this square is $8^2 = 64$ square feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$ square feet. I hope it is correct. \n",
