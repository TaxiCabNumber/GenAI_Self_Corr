At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of a pair of supplementary angles are in the ratio of 7:2. How many degrees are in the measure of their positive difference?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the measures are in the ratio $7:2$, the measures are $7x$ and $2x$ for some value of $x$.  Since the angles are supplementary, we have $7x + 2x = 180^\\circ$, so $9x = 180^\\circ$ and $x= 20^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $7x=140^\\circ$ and $2x=40^\\circ$, so their positive difference is $140^\\circ - 40^\\circ = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$."
