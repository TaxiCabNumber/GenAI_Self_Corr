At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial has a height of 60 feet. A scale model of the statue has a height of 4 inches. How many feet of the statue does one inch of the model represent?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{15}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio between a length on the model and a length on the statue is $4\\text{ inches}: 60\\text{ feet}$. Dividing both sides by 4, we have that 1 inch on the model corresponds to $60/4=\\boxed{15}$ feet on the statue."
