At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA car travels 192 miles on 6 gallons of gas. How far can it travel on 8 gallons of gas?",

        "ground_truth": "$\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}$ so 8 gallons is $4/3$ as much gas as 6 gallons is. Since the distance that a car can travel is directly proportional to the amount of gas that it has, if a car can travel $192$ miles on 6 gallons of gas, it can travel $192 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=64 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{256}$ miles on 8 gallons of gas."
