At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a spelling bee $50\\%$ of the students were eliminated after the first round. Only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining students were still in the contest after the second round. If 24 students were still in the contest after the second round, how many students began the contest?",

After both reductions, $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ of the students who began the contest remain.  Therefore, $24\\cdot6=\\boxed{144}$ students began the contest."
