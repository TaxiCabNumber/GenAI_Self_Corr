I hope it is correct.'\nFor a list of five positive integers, none greater than 100, the mean is 1.5 times the mode. If 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ are the five integers, what is the value of $x$?",
        "inference": "Solution:  The mean of the five integers is $\\frac{31+58+98+x+x}{5} = \\frac{187+2x}{5}$, and the mode is $x$.  We are given that the mean is 1.5 times the mode, so \\[\\frac{187+2x}{5} = 1.5x.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+2x = 7.5x$.  Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get $187 = 5.5x$.

        "inference": "The error is in the assumption that the mode of the list is  *x*. The mode is the most frequent value, but the problem doesn't tell us that *x* occurs more than once.  Here's the corrected solution:\n\nLet the five integers be $31$, $58$, $98$, $x$, and $y$.  The mean of these integers is \\[\\frac{31+58+98+x+y}{5}=\\frac{187+x+y}{5}.\\] We are given that the mean is 1.5 times the mode, so \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5\\cdot \\text{mode}.\\] Since the mode is the most frequent value, it must be one of the numbers $31$, $58$, $98$, $x$, or $y$.  We don't know which one it is, so we'll have to consider all five cases.\n\n* **Case 1:** If the mode is $31$, then \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5\\cdot 31=46.5.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+x+y=232.5$, so $x+y=45.5$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, this is impossible.\n\n* **Case 2:** If the mode is $58$, then \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5\\cdot 58=87.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+x+y=435$, so $x+y=248$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, this is possible.  However, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers.\n\n* **Case 3:** If the mode is $98$, then \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5\\cdot 98=147.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+x+y=735$, so $x+y=548$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, this is possible.  However, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers.\n\n* **Case 4:** If the mode is $x$, then \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5x.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+x+y=7.5x$, so $6.5x-y=187$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, this is possible.  However, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers.\n\n* **Case 5:** If the mode is $y$, then \\[\\frac{187+x+y}{5}=1.5y.\\] Multiplying both sides by 5, we get $187+x+y=7.5y$, so $x-6.5y=-187$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, this is possible.  However, we need to find a value of $x$ such that $x$ and $y$ are both integers.\n\nWe can try to solve each of the possible equations for $x$ and $y$ to see if we can find integer solutions.  However, it turns out that the only case that gives us integer solutions is Case 2.  In this case, we have $x+y=248$.  Since the mode is $58$, $x$ and $y$ must both be equal to 58.  Therefore, the list of integers is $31$, $58$, $98$, $58$, and $58$, and the answer is $\\boxed{58}$.",
