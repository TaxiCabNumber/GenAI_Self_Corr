        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle has sides of length 2 units. A second equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the first triangle. A third equilateral triangle is formed having sides that are $150\\%$ of the length of the sides of the second triangle. The process is continued until four equilateral triangles exist. What will be the percent increase in the perimeter from the first triangle to the fourth triangle? Express your answer to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe side length of the second triangle is 1.5 times the side length of the first triangle, or $1.5 \\cdot 2 = 3$ units.  The side length of the third triangle is 1.5 times the side length of the second triangle, or $1.5 \\cdot 3 = 4.5$ units.  The side length of the fourth triangle is 1.5 times the side length of the third triangle, or $1.5 \\cdot 4.5 = 6.75$ units.\n\nThe perimeter of the first triangle is $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ units.  The perimeter of the fourth triangle is $3 \\cdot 6.75 = 20.25$ units.\n\nThe percent increase in perimeter is $\\frac{20.25 - 6}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = \\frac{14.25}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 237.5\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{237.5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the side length of each successive equilateral triangle is $150\\%$ of the previous triangle, then we can multiply the previous side length by 1.5. We will need to do this three times to get to the fourth triangle, so its side length will be $$1.5^3 = 1.5 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.5 = 3.375$$ times the  original side length. This is the same as $337.5\\%$ of the original side length, which represents a $337.5 - 100 = 237.5\\%$ increase over the original side length. The perimeter is also a length, so it will be affected in the same way. The percent increase in the perimeter is $\\boxed{237.5\\%}$."
