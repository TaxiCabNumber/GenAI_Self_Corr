At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800. What is the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is $(n-2)180^\\circ$.  Since the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800, $(n-2)180 = 1800$.  Dividing both sides by 180, we find $n-2 = 10$, so $n=12$.  Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n+2 = 14$ sides is $(14-2)180 = \\boxed{2160}$ degrees. Final Answer: $\\boxed{2160}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  Therefore,  \\[\n180(n-2)=1800 \\implies n=12.\n\\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\\circ(14-2)=\\boxed{2160}$ degrees."
