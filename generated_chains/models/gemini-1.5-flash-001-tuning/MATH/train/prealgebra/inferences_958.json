At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJordan wants to divide his $\\frac{48}{5}$ pounds of chocolate into $4$ piles of equal weight.  If he gives one of these piles to his friend Shaina, how many pounds of chocolate will Shaina get?",

        "ground_truth": "We need to divide the amount of chocolate Jordan has by the the number of piles, so our expression is $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$.  Recall that dividing is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  Therefore, $\\frac{48}{5} \\div 4$ is the same thing as $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}.$ We can rewrite $\\frac{48}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$ as $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 48 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$, or $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$. To simplify this, divide $48$ by $4$, which equals $12$. Our previous expression, $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{48}{4}$, then equals $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 12$, which comes to $\\frac{12}{5}$.  So Shaina will receive $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$ pounds of chocolate."
