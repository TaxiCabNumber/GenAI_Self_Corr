        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBilly Goats invested some money in stocks and bonds. The total amount he invested was $\\$165,\\!000$. If he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as he did in bonds, what was his total investment in stocks?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the amount Billy Goats invested in bonds.  Then he invested $4.5x$ in stocks.  Since the total investment was $\\$165,\\!000$, we have the equation $x + 4.5x = 165,\\!000$.  Combining like terms, we get $5.5x = 165,\\!000$.  Dividing both sides by 5.5, we find $x = 30,\\!000$.  Therefore, Billy Goats invested $4.5 \\cdot 30,\\!000 = \\boxed{\\$135,\\!000}$ in stocks. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$135,\\!000}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the amount of money Billy invested in bonds be $s.$ Then, the amount of money he invested in stocks is $4.5s.$ The total amount of money he invested is $s+4.5s=5.5s=165,\\!000.$ Thus, $s=\\frac{165,\\!000}{5.5}=30,\\!000.$ Finally, the amount invested in stocks is $4.5s=4.5\\cdot30,\\!000=\\boxed{135,\\!000}$ dollars."
