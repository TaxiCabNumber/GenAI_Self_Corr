At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 18 miles north, then 11 miles west, then 6 miles south and finally 6 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
