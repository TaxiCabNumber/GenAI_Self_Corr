At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiselle will combine blue paint, green paint, and white paint in the ratio $3:2:4$, respectively. If she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, how many quarts of green paint should she use?",
