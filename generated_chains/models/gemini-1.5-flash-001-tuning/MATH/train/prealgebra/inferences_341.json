        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrea notices that the 40-foot tree next to her is casting a 10-foot shadow. How tall, in inches, is Andrea if she is casting a 15-inch shadow at the same time?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the tree's height to its shadow length is $40:10$, which simplifies to $4:1$.  This means the height of any object is 4 times the length of its shadow at this time.  Since Andrea's shadow is 15 inches long, she is $4 \\cdot 15 = 60$ inches tall.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\\text{ feet})/(10\\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\\times 15\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{60}$ inches tall."
