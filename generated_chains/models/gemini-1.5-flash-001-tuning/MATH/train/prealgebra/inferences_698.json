At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the interior angles of a particular triangle are in a 5:6:7 ratio. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle?",

Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\\implies 18k=180\\implies k=10$.  The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
