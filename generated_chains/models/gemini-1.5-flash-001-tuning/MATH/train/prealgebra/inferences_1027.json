At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf infinitely many values of $y$ satisfy the equation $2(4+cy) = 12y+8$, then what is the value of $c$?",

If $c=\\boxed{6}$, then this equation is always true, and the original equation is true for all $y$ (so it has infinitely many solutions).  Otherwise, the equation has only one solution ($y=0$)."
