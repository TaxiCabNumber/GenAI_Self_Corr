        "ground_truth": "Let the leg length of the isosceles right triangle be $x$, so the hypotenuse of the triangle has length $x\\sqrt{2}$.  The hypotenuse of the triangle is a side of the square, so the area of the square is $(x\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2$.  The area of the triangle is $(x)(x)/2 = x^2/2$.  So, the area of the pentagon is  \\[\\frac{x^2}{2} + 2x^2 = \\frac{5x^2}{2}.\\]Therefore, the fraction of the pentagon's area that is inside the triangle is  \\[\\frac{x^2/2}{5x^2/2} =\\frac{x^2}{2}\\cdot \\frac{2}{5x^2} = \\frac15 = \\boxed{20\\%}.\\](As an alternate solution, consider drawing the two diagonals of the square. What do you find?)"
