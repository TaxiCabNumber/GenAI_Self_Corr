        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that angle $AED$ is supplementary to angle $AEF$.  This is not true, as these angles share a common side and vertex.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Since angle $AED$ is an interior angle of triangle $AED$, we have  \\[\\angle AED = 180^\\circ - \\angle DAE - \\angle ADE.\\]  Since $\\angle DAE$ is an angle of the pentagon, $\\angle DAE = 108^\\circ$.  Since $\\angle ADE$ is an angle of the hexagon, $\\angle ADE = 120^\\circ$.  Therefore, \\[\\angle AED = 180^\\circ - 108^\\circ - 120^\\circ = \\boxed{-48^\\circ}.\\] This means angle $AED$ is actually a reflex angle, and we can find angle $DEF$ by subtracting from 360 degrees.  \\[\\angle DEF = 360^\\circ - \\angle AED = 360^\\circ - (-48^\\circ) = \\boxed{408^\\circ}.\\]",
