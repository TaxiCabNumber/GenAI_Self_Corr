At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn edge of a square can be expressed as $4x-15$ meters or as $20-3x$ meters. What is its area in square meters?",
        "inference": "We can find the value of $x$ by setting the two expressions for the side length equal to each other:\n\n$4x-15=20-3x$\n\nCombining like terms, we have:\n\n$7x = 35$\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we find:\n\n$x = 5$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of $x$ into either expression for the side length to find the actual side length:\n\n$4(5) - 15 = 5$ meters\n\nThe area of a square is side length squared, so the area of this square is:\n\n$5^2 = 25$ square meters\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.
