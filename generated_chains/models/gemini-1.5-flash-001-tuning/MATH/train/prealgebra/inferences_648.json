At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA convex pentagon has interior angles with measures $x+1$, $2x$, $3x$, $4x$, and $5x-1$ degrees.  What is the measure of the largest angle?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2)=540$ degrees.  Therefore,\n\\[(x+1) + 2x + 3x + 4x + (5x-1) = 540.\\]This simplifies to $15x = 540$, so $x = 36$.  The largest angle has measure $5x-1 = 5(36)-1 = \\boxed{179}$ degrees. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{179}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles of this pentagon is $(5-2)\\cdot180=540$ degrees. Thus, we have the equation $540=(x+1)+2x+3x+4x+(5x-1)\\Rightarrow 540 = 15x \\Rightarrow x=36$. The largest angle has measure $5x-1$, or $5\\cdot36-1=\\boxed{179}$ degrees."
