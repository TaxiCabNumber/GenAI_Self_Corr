        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a number is divided by 3, the result is 50 more than if the number had been divided by 4.  What is the number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number.  We are given that \n\\[\\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{x}{4} + 50.\\]Multiplying both sides by 12, we get\n\\[4x = 3x + 600.\\]Then $x = \\boxed{600}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{600}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We are asked to solve \\[\n\\frac{x}{3}=50+\\frac{x}{4}.\n\\] Subtract $x/4$ from both sides to find $x/12=50$, which implies $x=\\boxed{600}$."
