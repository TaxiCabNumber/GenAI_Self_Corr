At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a meeting with $25$ businessmen, twelve businessmen drank coffee, and ten businessmen drank tea.  Five businessmen drank both coffee and tea.  How many businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum $12+10$ counts twice the businessmen who drank both coffee and tea.  Since there are 5 such businessmen, we must subtract 5 from the sum $12+10$ to only count these businessmen once.  Therefore, a total of $12+10-5=17$ businessmen drank either coffee or tea.  So, $25-17=\\boxed{8}$ businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea."
