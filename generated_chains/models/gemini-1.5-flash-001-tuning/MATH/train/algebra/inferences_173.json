        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe quadratic $x^2-20x+36$ can be written in the form $(x+b)^2+c$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. What is $b+c$?",
        "inference": "Solution: We can expand $(x+b)^2+c$ to get $x^2+2bx+b^2+c$. Matching coefficients with $x^2-20x+36$, we see that $2b=-20$ and $b^2+c=36$. Solving the first equation, we find $b=-10$. Substituting into the second equation, we get $(-10)^2+c=36$, so $c=36-100=-64$. Therefore, $b+c=-10-64=\\boxed{-74}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{-74}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We complete the square.\n\nWe have $(x-10)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 100$, and so\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2-20x+ 36 &= (x-10)^2 + (36-100) \\\\\n&= (x-10)^2 - 64.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b=-10$ and $c=-64$, which gives us $b+c = \\boxed{-74}$."
