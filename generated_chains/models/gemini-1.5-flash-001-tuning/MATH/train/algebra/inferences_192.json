At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe solutions of $x(3x-7)=-3$ may be expressed in the form $\\frac{m+\\sqrt{n}}{p}$ and $\\frac{m-\\sqrt{n}}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ have a greatest common divisor of 1.  Find $m+n+p$.",

We use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$:\n\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nwhere $a=3$, $b=-7$, and $c=3$.  Substituting, we get\n\n$$x=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{(-7)^2-4(3)(3)}}{2(3)}=\\frac{7\\pm\\sqrt{13}}{6}$$\n\nTherefore, $m=7$, $n=13$, and $p=6$.  The final answer is $m+n+p=7+13+6=\\boxed{26}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Distribute on the left-hand side and add 3 to both sides to obtain $3x^2-7x+3=0$.
