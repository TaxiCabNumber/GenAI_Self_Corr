        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 + 2&\\text{if } x\\le 3, \\\\\nax - 1 &\\text{if } x>3.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find $a$ if the graph of $y=f(x)$ is continuous (which means the graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",
        "inference": "For the graph to be continuous, the two pieces of the function must meet at $x=3$.  This means that $3(3^2)+2 = 3a-1$.  Solving for $a$ gives $a=\\boxed{11}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=3$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases.  Therefore, we must have $3(3^2) + 2 = 3a - 1$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{10}$."
