The given equation rearranges to $14mn + 7m +2n +1 = 56$, which can be factored to $(7m + 1)(2n +1) = 56 = 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 7$.  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we see that $2n +1 > 1$ is odd.  Examining the factors on the right side, we see we must have $2n + 1 = 7$, implying $7m+1 = 2^3$.  Solving, we find that $(m,n) = \\boxed{(1,3)}$."
