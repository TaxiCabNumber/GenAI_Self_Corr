        "ground_truth": "The slope of a line through two points, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, is \\[\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.\\]Let $(x_1,y_1) = (4,5)$ and $(x_2,y_2) = (8,17)$. Then the slope of the line through the two points is \\[\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{17 - 5}{8 - 4} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3.\\]Thus, $a = 3$.\n\n$b$ satisfies $y = 3x + b$ for all points on its graph. Since $(4,5)$ lies on the the graph of $y = 3x + 5$, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 5$ to solve for $b$. $5 = 3(4) + b$ and subtracting 12 from both sides yields $b = -7$.
