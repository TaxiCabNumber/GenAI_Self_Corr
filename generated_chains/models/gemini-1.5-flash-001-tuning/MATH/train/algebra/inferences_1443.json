        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular cow pasture is enclosed on three sides by a fence and the fourth side is part of the side of a barn that is $400$ feet long. The fence costs $\\$5$ per foot, and $\\$1,\\!200$ altogether. To the nearest foot, find the length of the side parallel to the barn that will maximize the area of the pasture.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the length of the side of the pasture parallel to the barn.  The other two sides of the fence each have length $\\frac{1200-5x}{10}$, since the total cost of the fence is $\\$1200$ and each foot of fence costs $\\$5$.  The area of the pasture is then \n\\[x\\cdot \\frac{1200-5x}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}(1200x-5x^2).\\]We want to maximize this area.  The graph of this quadratic is a parabola that opens downward, so the maximum occurs at the vertex.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is \n\\[\\frac{-1200}{2(-5)} = 120,\\]so the length of the side parallel to the barn that maximizes the area is $\\boxed{120}$ feet. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the sides perpendicular to the barn be of length $x$. Notice that there are a total of $1200/5=240$ feet of fencing. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2x$, so the area to be maximized is $240x-2x^2$. Completing the square results in $-2(x-60)^2+7200$, which is maximized when $x=60$. Therefore, the side parallel to the barn has length $240-2(60)=\\boxed{120}$ feet."

        "inference": "The solution is correct.  The error in the original prompt is that it assumes the farmer only needs to fence three sides of the pasture.
