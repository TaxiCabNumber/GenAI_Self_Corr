At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &\\text{ if }x>2, \\\\\nx-5 &\\text{ if } -2 \\le x \\le 2, \\\\\n2x-b &\\text{ if } x <-2.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",
        "inference": "For the function to be continuous, the pieces must \"meet\" at the points where the definitions change. This means:\n\n*  At $x=2$, the value of $ax+3$ must equal the value of $x-5$.  Setting these equal, we get $2a+3 = 2-5$, so $a=-3$.\n* At $x=-2$, the value of $x-5$ must equal the value of $2x-b$.  Setting these equal, we get $-2-5 = -4-b$, so $b = -1$.\n\nTherefore, $a+b = -3+(-1) = \\boxed{-4}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$."
