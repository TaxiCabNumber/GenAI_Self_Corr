At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarina solved the quadratic equation $9x^2-18x-720=0$ by completing the square. In the process, she came up with the equivalent equation $$(x+r)^2 = s,$$where $r$ and $s$ are constants.\n\nWhat is $s$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\n1. We start by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:\n  $$x^2 - 2x - 80 = 0$$\n\n2. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term (-2), square it (1), and add it to both sides of the equation:\n  $$x^2 - 2x + 1 - 80 = 1$$\n\n3. This allows us to rewrite the left side as a perfect square:\n  $$(x-1)^2 - 80 = 1$$\n\n4. Adding 80 to both sides gives us:\n  $$(x-1)^2 = 81$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}$.

        "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation $9x^2-18x-720=0$ by $9$, we have $$x^2-2x-80 = 0.$$The square which agrees with $x^2-2x-80$ except for the constant term is $(x-1)^2$, which is equal to $x^2-2x+1$ and thus to $(x^2-2x-80)+81$.\n\nTherefore, by adding $81$ to each side, Marina rewrote the equation $x^2-2x-80 = 0$ as $$(x-1)^2 = 81.$$We have $r=-1$ and $s=\\boxed{81}$."
