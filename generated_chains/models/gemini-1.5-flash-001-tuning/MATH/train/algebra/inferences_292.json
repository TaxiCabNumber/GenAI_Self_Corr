        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo-thirds of the people in a room are seated in three-fourths of the chairs. The rest of the people are standing. If there are 6 empty chairs, how many people are in the room?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the total number of people in the room.  Since two-thirds of the people are seated, $\\frac{2}{3}x$ people are seated.  Since three-fourths of the chairs are filled,  $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the total number of chairs is equal to $\\frac{2}{3}x$. Let $y$ be the total number of chairs.  We have the equation $\\frac{3}{4}y=\\frac{2}{3}x$.  Since there are 6 empty chairs, $\\frac{1}{4}y=6$, so $y=24$.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get $\\frac{3}{4}(24)=\\frac{2}{3}x$, which simplifies to $18=\\frac{2}{3}x$.  Solving for $x$, we get $x=18\\cdot\\frac{3}{2}=27$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Because the 6 empty chairs are $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the chairs in the room, there are $6\\times 4=24$ chairs in all. The number of seated people is $\\frac{3}{4}\\times24=18$, and this is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the people present. It follows that \\[\\frac{18}{\\textrm{people present}}=\\frac{2}{3}.\\]So there are $\\boxed{27}$ people in the room."
