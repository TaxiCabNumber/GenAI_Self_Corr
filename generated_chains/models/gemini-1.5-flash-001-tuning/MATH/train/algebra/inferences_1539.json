        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 2y-8x+1$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Move all terms to the left side of the equation:\n$x^2 + y^2 + 8x - 2y - 8 = 0$\n\n2. Complete the square in $x$ and $y$:\n$(x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 8 + 16 + 1$\n\n3. Rewrite the equation in standard form of a circle:\n$(x+4)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 25 = 5^2$\n\n4. The equation now represents a circle with center $(-4, 1)$ and radius $5$.\n\n5. The area of a circle is given by $\u03c0r^2$.\n\n6.  Therefore, the area of the region is $\u03c0(5^2) = 25\u03c0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25\\pi}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 2y = 8$ and then complete the square, resulting in  $(x+4)^2-16 + (y-1)^2-1=8$, or $(x+4)^2+(y-1)^2=25$. This is the equation of a circle with center $(-4, 1)$ and radius 5, so the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (5)^2 = \\boxed{25\\pi}$."
