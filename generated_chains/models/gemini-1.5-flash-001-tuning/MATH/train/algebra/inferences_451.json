At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $m$ is a real number and $x^2+mx+4$ has two distinct real roots, then what are the possible values of $m$?  Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "A quadratic equation has two distinct real roots if and only if its discriminant is positive. The discriminant of $x^2 + mx + 4$ is $m^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4 = m^2 - 16$.  We want $m^2 - 16 > 0$, which factors as $(m-4)(m+4) > 0$. This inequality holds when $m < -4$ or $m > 4$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-4) \\cup (4,\\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $x^2+mx+4$ are real and positive when $m^2-4(1)(4) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-4)(m+4) > 0$, which implies $m\\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-4)\\cup (4,\\infty)}$."
