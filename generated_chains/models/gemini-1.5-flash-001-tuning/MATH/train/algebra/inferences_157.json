        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy works for 36 hours per week for 10 weeks during the summer, making $\\$3000$. If she works for 30 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$3000$, how many hours per week must she work?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Amy's total weekly earnings:** She earns $3000 in 10 weeks, so she earns $3000/10 = $300 per week.\n\n2. **Calculate Amy's hourly rate:** She earns $300 per week for 36 hours, so she makes $300/36 = $8.33 per hour.\n\n3. **Calculate the total hours needed to earn $3000 during the school year:**  She needs to make $3000 at a rate of $8.33 per hour, so she needs to work $3000/$8.33 = 360 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the number of hours per week Amy needs to work:** She needs to work 360 hours in 30 weeks, so she needs to work 360/30 = 12 hours per week.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.** \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 3 times as many weeks, she can work 3 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
