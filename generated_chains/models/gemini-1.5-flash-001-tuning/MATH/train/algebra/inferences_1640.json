        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of ounces of pure water that must be added.  The total amount of solution will then be $30 + x$ ounces.  Since the amount of acid in the solution remains constant, we have the equation \\[0.30 \\cdot 30 = 0.20 (30 + x).\\]Solving for $x$, we find \\[9 = 6 + 0.20x.\\]This simplifies to $3 = 0.20x$, so $x = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$.

        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water."
