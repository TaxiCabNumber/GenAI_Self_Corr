At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA recent study found that 60$\\%$ of men and 80$\\%$ of women surveyed support increased funding for particular medical research. The study surveyed 100 men and 900 women. What was the overall percent of the people surveyed who supported increased funding?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\n- The number of men who supported increased funding is $60\\% * 100 = 60$ men. \n- The number of women who supported increased funding is $80\\% * 900 = 720$ women.\n- The total number of people who supported increased funding is $60 + 720 = 780$ people.\n- The overall percent of the people surveyed who supported increased funding is $\\frac{780}{100 + 900} * 100\\% = 78\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78\\%}$.
