At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLaura is training for a triathlon, but she doesn't feel like swimming. She bikes $20$ miles at $2x+1$ miles per hour, spends five minutes parking her bike, changing to her running shoes, and catching a drink of water, and then runs $5$ miles at $x$ miles per hour. Her total workout lasts $110$ minutes. How fast did Laura run, to the nearest hundredth of a mile per hour?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",

        "inference": "The solution above makes a common mistake: It treats the time it takes to bike 20 miles as if it were a direct function of the running speed.  This is incorrect, as the time spent biking is independent of the speed at which Laura runs. \n\nHere is the corrected solution:\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* **Biking:** Laura bikes 20 miles at a speed of 2x + 1 mph. The time spent biking is 20 / (2x + 1) hours.\n* **Running:** Laura runs 5 miles at a speed of x mph. The time spent running is 5 / x hours.\n* **Parking:** Laura spends 5 minutes (1/12 hour) parking.\n* **Total workout time:** 110 minutes (11/6 hours)\n\nWe can set up an equation to represent the total workout time:\n\n(20 / (2x + 1)) + (5 / x) + (1/12) = 11/6\n\nNow, we need to solve for x:\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators (12x(2x + 1)):**\n   12x(20) + 12(2x + 1)(5) + x(2x + 1) = 22x(2x + 1)\n\n2. **Expand and simplify:**\n   240x + 120x + 60 + 2x\u00b2 + x = 44x\u00b2 + 22x\n\n3. **Combine like terms and move everything to one side:**\n   42x\u00b2 - 239x - 60 = 0\n\n4. **Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:**\n   x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / 2a \n   where a = 42, b = -239, and c = -60\n\n5. **Calculate the solutions:**\n   x = (239 \u00b1 \u221a(239\u00b2 - 4 * 42 * -60)) / (2 * 42)\n   x \u2248 6.04 or x \u2248 -0.24\n\n6. **Discard the negative solution, as speed cannot be negative:**\n   x \u2248 6.04\n\nTherefore, Laura ran at approximately **\\boxed{6.04}** miles per hour. \n",
