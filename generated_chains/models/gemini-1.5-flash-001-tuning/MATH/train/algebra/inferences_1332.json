At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice buys three burgers and two sodas for $\\$3.20$, and Bill buys two burgers and a soda for $\\$2.00$. How many cents does a burger cost?",
        "inference": "Let $b$ be the cost of a burger in cents and $s$ be the cost of a soda in cents.\n\nWe have the system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3b + 2s &= 320\\\\\n2b + s &= 200\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nMultiplying the second equation by -2, we get:\n$$\n-4b - 2s = -400\n$$\n\nAdding this equation to the first equation, we get:\n$$\n-b = -80\n$$\n\nTherefore, $b = 80$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents. So, Alice's three burgers and two sodas cost 320 cents and Bill's food costs 200 cents. Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents. We are trying to find the value of $b$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. These equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3b + 2s &= 320 \\\\\n2b + s &= 200 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We are solving for $b$, so we want to eliminate $s$ from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $4b+2s = 400$, or $2s = 400 - 4b$. Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $s$, we get that $3b + (400-4b) = 320$, or $b=80$. Thus, a burger costs $\\boxed{80}$ cents."
