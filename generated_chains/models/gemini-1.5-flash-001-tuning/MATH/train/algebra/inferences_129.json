        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $x$ is the expression $\\frac{2x^3+3}{x^2-20x+100}$ not defined?",
        "inference": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to zero.  So we need to solve the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$.  This factors as $(x-10)^2 = 0$, so $x = \\boxed{10}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The only time this expression is not defined is when the denominator is equal to 0. In other words, we are looking for all solutions to the equation $x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$. We can find the roots by factoring the quadratic into $(x - 10)(x - 10) = 0$ or by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{(-20)^2-4(1)(100)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we see that $x = 10$ is the only time when the denominator of our expression is equal to 0. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
