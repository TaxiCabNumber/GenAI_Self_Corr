At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Multiply both sides by -3:\n$$x^2 = 36$$\n4. Take the square root of both sides (remembering both positive and negative roots):\n$$x = \\pm 6$$\n5.

        "ground_truth": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $4-\\frac{x^2}{3} = -8$.  Solving this equation gives $x^2 = 36$, so $x=6$ or $x=-6$, so the positive difference between the two solutions is $\\boxed{12}$."
