At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStarting with the number 100, Shaffiq repeatedly divides his number by two and then takes the greatest integer less than or equal to that number. How many times must he do this before he reaches the number 1?",

Finally, he divides by $2$ to get $1.5$ and takes the greatest integer to get $1$. This is a total of $\\boxed{6}$ times."
