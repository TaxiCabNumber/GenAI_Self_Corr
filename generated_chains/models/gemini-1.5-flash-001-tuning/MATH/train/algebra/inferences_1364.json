        "inference": "The vertex of the parabola is at $(2,-4)$.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the roots, so $\\frac{m+n}{2} = 2$.  Since the parabola opens upward, the smaller root is to the left of the vertex and the larger root is to the right of the vertex.  The graph passes through the point $(4,12)$, so $n=4$ and $m=0$.

        "ground_truth": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,-4)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=-4$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2-4$. Now, substituting the other given point $(4,12)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n12&=a(4-2)^2-4\\\\\n16&=a(2)^2\\\\\n16&=4a\\\\\n4&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=4(x-2)^2-4$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=4(x-2)^2-4 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=1$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 1$, so $x=3$ or $x=1$. Thus, $m=3$ and $n=1$, so $m-n=3-1=\\boxed{2}$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is not necessarily the average of the roots unless the parabola is symmetric about the $y$-axis. \n\nHere's how to solve the problem:\n\nSince the parabola opens upward, we know the equation is of the form $y = a(x - 2)^2 - 4$. We can use the point $(4,12)$ to solve for $a$:\n\n$12 = a(4-2)^2 - 4$\n$12 = 4a - 4$\n$16 = 4a$\n$a = 4$\n\nNow we have the equation of the parabola: $y = 4(x-2)^2 - 4$. To find the roots, we set $y=0$ and solve:\n\n$0 = 4(x-2)^2 - 4$\n$1 = (x-2)^2$\n$x-2 = \\pm 1$\n\nSo the roots are $x=1$ and $x=3$.  Therefore, $m - n = 1 - 3 = \\boxed{-2}$. \n",
