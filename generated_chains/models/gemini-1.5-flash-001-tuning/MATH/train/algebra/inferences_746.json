        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo arithmetic sequences $A$ and $B$ both begin with 30 and have common differences of absolute value 10, with sequence $A$ increasing and sequence $B$ decreasing. What is the absolute value of the difference between the 51st term of sequence $A$ and the 51st term of sequence $B$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1000}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence whose first term is $a_1$ and whose common difference is $d$ is $a_n=a_1+d(n-1)$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of $A$ is $30+10(n-1)$, and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30-10(n-1)$.  Therefore, the positive difference between the $n$th term of $A$ and the $n$th term of $B$ is $30+10(n-1)-[30-10(n-1)]=20(n-1)$.  Substituting $n=51$, we find that the positive difference between the 51st terms of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{1000}$."
