        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that we have an equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ whose graph is a parabola with vertex $(3,2)$, vertical axis of symmetry, and contains the point $(1,0)$.\n\nWhat is $(a, b, c)$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nSince the vertex is $(3,2)$ and the axis of symmetry is vertical, the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y = a(x-3)^2 + 2$.  Substituting the point $(1,0)$ gives $0 = a(1-3)^2 + 2$, so $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y = -\\frac{1}{2}(x-3)^2 + 2$.  Expanding, we find $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x - \\frac{7}{2}$.  Thus, $(a,b,c) = \\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, 3, -\\frac{7}{2}\\right)}$.
