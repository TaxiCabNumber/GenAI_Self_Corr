        "inference": "Since the parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry and its vertex is at $(2, 4)$, its equation is of the form \n\\[(x - 2)^2 = 4p(y - 4).\\]Since the parabola passes through the point $(1, 1)$, we can substitute $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ into the equation:\n\\[(1 - 2)^2 = 4p(1 - 4).\\]This simplifies to $1 = -12p$, so $p = -\\frac{1}{12}$.  Substituting this into the equation for the parabola, we get\n\\[(x - 2)^2 = 4 \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} \\right) (y - 4).\\]This simplifies to $(x - 2)^2 = -\\frac{1}{3} (y - 4)$.  Multiplying both sides by $-3$, we get $-3(x - 2)^2 = y - 4$, so $y = -3(x - 2)^2 + 4$.  Expanding the right side, we get\n\\[y = -3x^2 + 12x - 12 + 4 = \\boxed{-3x^2 + 12x - 8}.\\]Final Answer: $\\boxed{-3x^2 + 12x - 8}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(2,4)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+4\\] for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(1,1)$ into this expression gives  \\[1=a(1-2)^2+4=a+4.\\] This tells us $a=-3$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-3(x-2)^2+4.\\] Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-3(x^2-4x+4)+4=\\boxed{-3x^2+12x-8}.\\]"
