        "inference": "The error is in assuming that $f(x)$ must be constant.  We need to find all possible functions $f(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions. \n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nWe have the equation  $f(f(x)) = x^2 - 4$ for all $x$.  Let $y = f(x)$.  Then $f(y) = x^2 - 4$.  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\pm \\sqrt{f(y) + 4}$.  Substituting this into the equation $y = f(x)$, we get\n\\[y = f(\\pm \\sqrt{f(y) + 4}).\\]Since this equation must hold for all values of $y$, we can replace $y$ with $x$ to get\n\\[x = f(\\pm \\sqrt{f(x) + 4}).\\]We can now see that $f(x) = x$ is a solution.  Furthermore, if $f(x)$ is a solution, then $f(-x)$ is also a solution.  Therefore, the solutions are $f(x) = x$ and $f(x) = -x$.  \n\nWe can check that these solutions work:\n\n* If $f(x) = x$, then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x = x^2 - 4$ if and only if $x^2 - x - 4 = 0$.  This quadratic has two real roots.\n\n* If $f(x) = -x$, then $f(f(x)) = f(-x) = x = x^2 - 4$ if and only if $x^2 + x - 4 = 0$.  This quadratic also has two real roots.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{4}$ solutions. \n",
