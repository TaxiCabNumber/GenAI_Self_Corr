At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of the product $(ax^3 + 3x^2 - 2x)(bx^2 - 7x - 4)$.",
        "inference": "Solution: To get the $x^2$ term, we need to multiply terms that will result in a total degree of 2. There are three possible combinations:\n\n* $(ax^3)(-4)$\n* $(3x^2)(bx^2)$\n* $(-2x)(-7x)$\n\nExpanding these, we get:\n\n* $-4ax^3$\n* $3bx^4$\n* $14x^2$\n\nThe coefficient of the $x^2$ term is the sum of the coefficients of these terms, which is $3b + 14$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3b + 14}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We only need to worry about the terms that multiply to have a degree of $2$. This would be given by the product of the terms $3x^2$ and $-4$ as well as the product of the terms $-2x$ and $-7x$. Thus, $$(3x^2) \\times (-4) + (-2x) \\times (-7x) = -12x^2 + 14x^2 = 2x^2,$$and the coefficient is $\\boxed{2}$."
