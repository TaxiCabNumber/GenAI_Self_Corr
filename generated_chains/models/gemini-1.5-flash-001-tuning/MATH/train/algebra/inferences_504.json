At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-7x+1$ and $y=8x^2+5x+1$. Give all points where they intersect.  List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
        "inference": "To find the points of intersection, we set the two equations equal to each other: \n $$2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1.$$\n Subtracting $2x^2-7x+1$ from both sides, we get \n $$0 = 6x^2 + 12x.$$\n Factoring, we get \n $$0 = 6x(x+2).$$\n Therefore, $x = 0$ or $x = -2.$  Substituting $x = 0$ into the first equation, we get $y = 1.$  Substituting $x = -2,$ we get $y = 27.$  So the points of intersection are $\\boxed{(-2,27);(0,1)}.$\n Final Answer: $\\boxed{(-2,27);(0,1)}.$ I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, set the two equations equal to each other to get $2x^2-7x+1=8x^2+5x+1$. Combine like terms to get $6x^2+12x=0$. Then, we can divide by $6$ to get $x^2+2x=0$. To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ to both sides, giving $(x+1)^2=1$.\n\nSo we have $x+1=\\pm1$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $0$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2, 23)}$ and $\\boxed{(0, 1)}$."
