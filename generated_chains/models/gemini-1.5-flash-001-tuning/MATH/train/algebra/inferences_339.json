At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZachary paid for a $\\$1$ burger with 32 coins and received no change. Each coin was either a penny or a nickel. What was the number of nickels Zachary used?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of nickels Zachary used. Then, $32 - n$ is the number of pennies he used. The total value of the nickels is $5n$ cents, and the total value of the pennies is $32-n$ cents. Since the total value of the coins is 100 cents, we have the equation: $5n + (32 - n) = 100$ \nSolving for $n$ we get $n = 17$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $p$ is the number of pennies and $n$ is the number of nickels that Zachary used, then we are given \\begin{align*}\np+n&=32\\text{, and} \\\\\np+5n&=100.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we find $4n=68$ which implies $n=\\boxed{17}$."
