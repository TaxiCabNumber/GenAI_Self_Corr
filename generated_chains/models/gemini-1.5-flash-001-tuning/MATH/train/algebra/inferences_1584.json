        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can rewrite the equation of the parabola as follows: \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 14x + 3y + 70 &= 21 + 11y - y^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2 - 14x + 49 + y^2 - 8y + 16 &= 21 + 11y - y^2 + 49 + 16\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad (x-7)^2 + (y-4)^2 &= 86\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the equation of a circle centered at $(7, 4)$ with radius $\\sqrt{86}$.\n\nNext, we find the points of intersection between the parabola and the line.  Substituting $y=x-3$ into the equation of the parabola, we obtain:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 - 14x + 3(x-3) + 70 &= 21 + 11(x-3) - (x-3)^2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2 - 14x + 3x - 9 + 70 &= 21 + 11x - 33 - x^2 + 6x - 9\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2x^2 - 26x + 61 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{26^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 61}}{4}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\pm \\sqrt{196}}{4}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\pm 14}{4}\\\\\n&= \\frac{15}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe corresponding $y$ values are $y = \\frac{9}{2}$ and $y=0$.\n\nNow, we can break the area up into two parts: a sector of the circle and a triangle.\n\nThe sector is defined by the two points of intersection on the circle and the center of the circle.  The angle of this sector is determined by the angle between the two points of intersection and the center of the circle.  This angle is equal to the angle between the line $y=x-3$ and the horizontal line $y=4$ (which passes through the center of the circle).  This angle is given by:\n\n$$\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{1} \\right) = 45^\\circ.$$\n\nThus, the sector is one-eighth of the circle.  Its area is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{8} \\pi (\\sqrt{86})^2 = \\frac{43}{4} \\pi.$$\n\nThe triangle is defined by the two points of intersection on the circle and the point $(3,0)$.  Its base is $\\frac{9}{2} - 0 = \\frac{9}{2}$ and its height is $3 - 0 = 3$.  Its area is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)(3) = \\frac{27}{4}.$$\n\nFinally, the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation that lies below the line $y=x-3$ is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{43}{4}\\pi + \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{43\\pi + 27}{4}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{43\\pi + 27}{4}}$.

        "ground_truth": "The equation can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\nx^2-14x+y^2-8y & =-49\\\\\nx^2-14x+49+y^2-8y+16& =16\\\\\n(x-7)^2+(y-4)^2 & =16\n\\end{align*}Thus, the region is a circle with center $(7,4)$ and radius 4. As $(7,4)$ is on the line $y=x-3$, the line passes through the center of the circle. Hence, half of the area of the circle lies below the line $y=x-3$. The radius of the circle is 4, so the circle has area $16\\pi$. Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\\boxed{8 \\pi}$."
