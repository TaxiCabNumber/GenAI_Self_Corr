What are the coordinates of point $C$?",

Using the distance formula, we have\n\\[\\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2} = 3 \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 8)^2}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 9[(x - 3)^2 + (y - 8)^2].\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 = 9(x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 16y + 64).\\]This simplifies to $8x^2 - 56x + 8y^2 - 144y + 576 = 0$, or $x^2 - 7x + y^2 - 18y + 72 = 0$.  Completing the square in $x$ and $y$, we get\n\\[(x - 7/2)^2 + (y - 9)^2 = 25/4.\\]Since $C$ lies on segment $AB$, the $x$-coordinate of $C$ must lie between $-1$ and 3.
