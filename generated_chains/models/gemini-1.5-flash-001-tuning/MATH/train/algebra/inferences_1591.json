At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDr. Fu Manchu has a bank account that has an annual interest rate of 6 percent, but it compounds monthly.  If this is equivalent to a bank account that compounds annually at a rate of $r$ percent, then what is $r$?  (Give your answer to the nearest hundredth.)",

        "ground_truth": "The bank account compounds monthly at an interest rate of $6/12 = 0.5$ percent.  Therefore, in the course of a year, the bank account compounds annually at a rate of $1.005^{12} = 1.061678 \\dots$.  To the nearest hundredth, the interest rate is $\\boxed{6.17}$ percent."
