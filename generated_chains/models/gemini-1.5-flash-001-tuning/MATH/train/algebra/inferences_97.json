At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular day in Salt Lake, UT, the temperature was given by $-t^2 +12t+50$ where $t$ is the time in hours past noon. What is the largest $t$ value at which the temperature was exactly 77 degrees?",
