I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of three real numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9. If 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the three resulting numbers form a geometric progression. What is the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression?",
        "inference": "Let the common difference of the arithmetic progression be $d$. Then the three terms of the arithmetic progression are $9$, $9+d$, and $9+2d$.\n\nAdding 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term gives us the sequence $9$, $9+d+2$, and $9+2d+20$, which is a geometric progression.  This means \n\\[(9 + d + 2)^2 = 9(9 + 2d + 20).\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[d^2 + 22d + 121 = 261 + 18d.\\]This simplifies to $d^2 + 4d - 140 = 0$, which factors as $(d + 14)(d - 10) = 0$.  Thus, $d = -14$ or $d = 10$.\n\nIf $d = -14$, then the third term of the geometric progression is $9 + 2(-14) + 20 = 1$.  If $d = 10$, then the third term of the geometric progression is $9 + 2(10) + 20 = 49$.\n\nThe smaller of these two values is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The terms of the arithmetic progression are 9, $9+d$, and $9+2d$ for some real number $d$. The terms of the geometric progression are 9, $11+d$, and $29+2d$. Therefore \\[\n(11+d)^{2} = 9(29+2d) \\quad\\text{so}\\quad d^{2}+4d-140 = 0.\n\\]Thus $d=10$ or $d=-14$. The corresponding geometric progressions are $9, 21, 49$ and $9, -3, 1,$ so the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $\\boxed{1}$."
