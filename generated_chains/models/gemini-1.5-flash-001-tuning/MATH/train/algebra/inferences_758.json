At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe height of a ball when it is thrown off a cliff can be represented by the equation $h=45-7t-6t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball reach a height of 25 feet?",
        "inference": "We are given the equation for the height of the ball: $h=45-7t-6t^2$.
