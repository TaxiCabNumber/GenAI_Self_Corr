        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMurtha has decided to start a pebble collection. She collects one pebble the first day and two pebbles on the second day. On each subsequent day she collects one more pebble than the previous day. How many pebbles will she have collected at the end of the twelfth day?",
        "inference": "Murtha collects pebbles in an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 1 and a common difference of 1.  The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series is $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $a_n$ is the $n$th term.  So, the sum of the first 12 terms of Murtha's pebble collection is $\\frac{12}{2}(1 + 12) = 6 \\cdot 13 = 78$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the number of pebbles increases each day, the total number of pebbles is equal to $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 11 + 12 = (1+12) + (2 + 11) + \\cdots + (6 + 7) = 6 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{78}$."
