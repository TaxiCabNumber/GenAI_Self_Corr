At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarcelle and Jaclyn each think of a polynomial.  Each of their polynomials is monic, has degree 4, and has the same positive constant term and the same coefficient of $z$. The product of their polynomials is \\[z^8 +3z^7 +z^6 +3z^5 +4z^4 +6z^3 +2z^2 +4.\\]What  is the constant term of Jaclyn's polynomial?",
