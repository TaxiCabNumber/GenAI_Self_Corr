        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(n) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nn^2-2 & \\text{ if }n<0, \\\\\n2n-20 & \\text{ if }n \\geq 0.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]What is the positive difference between the two values of $a$ that satisfy the equation $f(-2)+f(2)+f(a)=0$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{17}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by finding $f(-2)$ and $f(2)$. Since $-2<0$, we have that $f(-2)=(-2)^2-2=2$ and since $2 \\geq 0$, we have that $f(2)=2(2)-20=-16$. Now we can substitute these values back into our equation $f(-2)+f(2)+f(a)=0$ to get $2 + (-16) + f(a) = 0$, so $f(a)=14$.\n\nOur next step is to find all values of $a$ such that $f(a)=14$. Our first equation $f(a)=a^2-2=14$ yields that $a= \\pm 4$, but $a<0$ so $a=-4$ is the only solution. Our second equation $f(a)=2a-20=14$ yields that $a=17$ which is indeed greater than or equal to $0$. Thus, our two possible values of $a$ are $-4$ and $17$ and their positive difference is $17 - (-4) = \\boxed{21}$."
