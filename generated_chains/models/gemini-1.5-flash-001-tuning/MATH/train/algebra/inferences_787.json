I hope it is correct.'\nAl, Betty, and Clare split $\\$1000$ among them to be invested in different ways. Each begins with a different amount. At the end of one year they have a total of $\\$1500$. Betty and Clare have both doubled their money, whereas Al has managed to lose $\\$100$. What was Al's original portion?",

        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that $A-100 + 2B + 2C = 1500$ represents the final amounts after the transactions.  The problem states that Al gives $100 to Betty, who then gives twice that amount to Clare, and then Clare gives twice that amount to Al.  \n\nLet's break down the transactions:\n\n1. **Al gives $100 to Betty:**  Al has $A-100$, Betty has $B+100$, and Clare has $C$.\n2. **Betty gives $200 to Clare:** Al has $A-100$, Betty has $B-100$, and Clare has $C+200$.\n3. **Clare gives $400 to Al:** Al has $A+300$, Betty has $B-100$, and Clare has $C-200$.\n\nSince the final amounts must add up to $1000$, we have the equation: \n$(A+300) + (B-100) + (C-200) = 1000$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: $A+B+C=1000$.  We know this is true from the original problem statement.  Therefore, the final amount Al has is $A+300 = 500 + 300 = \\boxed{\\$800}$.  \n",
