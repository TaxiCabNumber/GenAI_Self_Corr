        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo regular polygons have the same perimeter. If the first has 38 sides and a side length twice as long as the second, how many sides does the second have?",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of the second polygon. Then the side length of the first polygon is $2s$. Since the perimeters are equal, we have  \\[38(2s) = ns\\]where $n$ is the number of sides of the second polygon. Dividing both sides by $s$ gives $76 = n$, so the second polygon has $\\boxed{76}$ sides. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{76}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides."

The problem states that the polygons have equal side lengths, not equal perimeters. \n\nSince the side length of the first polygon is twice the side length of the second polygon, the first polygon has **half** as many sides as the second polygon. \n\nTherefore, the second polygon has $\\boxed{76}$ sides. \n",
