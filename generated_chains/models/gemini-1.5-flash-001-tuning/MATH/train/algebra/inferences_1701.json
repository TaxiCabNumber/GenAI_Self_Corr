At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
