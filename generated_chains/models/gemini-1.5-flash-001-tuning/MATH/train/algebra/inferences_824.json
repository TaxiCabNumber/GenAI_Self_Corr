This simplifies to $x^2 - x - 12 = 0$, which factors as $(x - 4)(x + 3) = 0$.  Since $x$ is positive, $x = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",

Squaring both sides gives $x^2 = 12+x$, so $x^2 -x-12 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x-4)(x+3) = 0$. Therefore, $x=4$ or $x=-3$.  Clearly $x$ must be positive, so we have $x= \\boxed{4}$."
