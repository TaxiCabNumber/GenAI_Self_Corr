At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle having integer length and width has a perimeter of 100 units. What is the number of square units in the least possible area?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that $2l + 2w = 100$, which simplifies to $l + w = 50$.  We want to minimize the area, which is given by $lw$.\n\nSince $l + w = 50$, we can write $w = 50 - l$. Substituting into the area formula, we get:\n\n$lw = l(50 - l) = 50l - l^2$\n\nThis is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards. The minimum value occurs at the vertex.  The $l$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-b/2a$, where $a = -1$ and $b = 50$.  Therefore, the minimum value occurs at $l = -50/(2(-1)) = 25$.\n\nWhen $l = 25$, we have $w = 50 - l = 25$.  The area is then $lw = 25 \\cdot 25 = 625$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{625}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "A rectangle with fixed perimeter has minimal area when one dimension is as long as possible and the other is as short as possible. To see this, let $x$ be the shorter dimension and $y$ the area of the rectangle, and note that $y=x(50-x)$. The graph of $y=x(50-x)$ is a down-turned parabola with vertex at $(25,625)$, and thus is as small as possible when $x$ is as small as possible. Since $x$ is an integer, its minimum value is 1. Thus the relevant rectangle with minimum area is 1 by 49.  Its area is $49\\cdot 1=\\boxed{49}$ square units."
