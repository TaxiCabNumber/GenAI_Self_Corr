At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the polynomial $x^2-kx+16$ has only positive integer roots, find the average of all distinct possibilities for $k$.",

Since $r$ and $s$ are positive integers, the possible pairs $(r,s)$ are $(1,16)$, $(2,8)$, $(4,4)$.  The corresponding values of $k$ are $17$, $10$, and $8$.  The average of these values is $\\frac{17+10+8}{3}=\\boxed{15}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Since $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product and $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1r_2=16$ and $r_1+r_2=k$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are integers, both must be factors of 16. The only possible combinations for $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(16,1),(8,2),(4,4)$, and the inverses of each ordered pair, which replicate values of $k$ already accounted for. Therefore, the only possible values of $k$ are 17,10, and 8, which average to $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{3}}$."
