At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe pages of a book are numbered $1_{}^{}$ through $n_{}^{}$. When the page numbers of the book were added, one of the page numbers was mistakenly added twice, resulting in an incorrect sum of $1986_{}^{}$. What was the number of the page that was added twice?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nThe sum of the numbers from $1_{}^{}$ to $n_{}^{}$ is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We know that this sum, plus one additional page number, equals 1986.  We can write this as an equation:\n\n$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + x = 1986$\n\nwhere $x_{}^{}$ is the page number that was added twice.\n\nTo find the value of $n_{}^{}$, we need to find the largest possible value of $n_{}^{}$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} < 1986$. We can see that $\\frac{63(64)}{2} = 2016_{}^{}$, so $n_{}^{}$ must be less than 63.  Let's try $n=62_{}^{}$.  We get $\\frac{62(63)}{2} = 1953_{}^{}$.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$1953 + x = 1986$\n\n$x = 1986 - 1953$\n\n$x = 33$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
