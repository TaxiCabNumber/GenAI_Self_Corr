        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy friend and I both have the same math homework one day. I work at a rate of $p$ problems per hour and it takes me $t$ hours to finish my homework. My friend works at a rate of $2p-4$ problems per hour and it only takes him $t-2$ hours to finish his homework. Given that $p$ and $t$ are positive whole numbers and I do more than $10$ problems per hour, how many problems did I do?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "From the information given, we can set up the following equation: $pt = (2p-4)(t-2)$. Simplifying this, we get $pt - 4p - 4t = -8$. Now, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $16$ to both sides to get $pt - 4p - 4t + 16 = 8$. This factors to $$(p-4)(t-4)=8$$Since $p>10$, the only possible combination of $p$ and $t$ is $p=12$ and $t=5$. Thus, I did a total of $12 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{60}$ problems."
