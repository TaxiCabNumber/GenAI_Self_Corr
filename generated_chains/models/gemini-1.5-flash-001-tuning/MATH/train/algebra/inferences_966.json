At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCorn costs 99 cents per pound, and beans cost 45 cents per pound. If Shea buys 24 total pounds of corn and beans, and it costs $\\$18.09$, how many pounds of corn did Shea buy? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "Let $c$ be the number of pounds of corn Shea bought.  Then Shea bought $24-c$ pounds of beans.  The cost of the corn is $0.99c$ dollars, and the cost of the beans is $0.45(24-c)$ dollars.  The total cost is $0.99c + 0.45(24-c) = 18.09$ dollars.  Solving for $c$, we find $c = \\boxed{15.6}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{15.6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ and $b$ be the number of pounds of corn and beans Shea buys, respectively. We can turn the givens into a two-variable, linear system: \\begin{align*}\nb+c&=24\\\\\n45b+99c&=1809\n\\end{align*} We can multiply the first equation by 45 and subtract it from the second to get $(99-45)c=1809-45(24)$, which reduces to $54c=729$ or $c=13.5$. So Shea buys $\\boxed{13.5\\text{ pounds}}$ of corn."
