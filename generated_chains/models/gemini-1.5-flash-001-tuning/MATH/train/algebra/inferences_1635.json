At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle is called cool if the number of square units in its area is equal to twice the number of units in its perimeter. A cool rectangle also must have integer side lengths. What is the sum of all the different possible areas of cool rectangles?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$.  We are given that $lw = 2(2l + 2w)$.  Simplifying, we get $lw = 4l + 4w$, or $lw - 4l - 4w = 0$.  Adding 16 to both sides, we get $lw - 4l - 4w + 16 = 16$, which factors as $(l - 4)(w - 4) = 16$.  Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, the only possible pairs $(l - 4, w - 4)$ are $(1, 16)$, $(2, 8)$, $(4, 4)$, $(8, 2)$, and $(16, 1)$.  These give us rectangles with dimensions $5 \\times 20$, $6 \\times 12$, $8 \\times 8$, $12 \\times 6$, and $20 \\times 5$.  The areas of these rectangles are 100, 72, 64, 72, and 100, and the sum of these is $100 + 72 + 64 + 72 + 100 = \\boxed{408}$.",
