        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, we know that the equation of the line is $y = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.\n2. We are given that the slope is $-2$, so $m = -2$.\n3. We are also given that the $x$-intercept is $(5,0)$. This means that the point $(5,0)$ lies on the line. Substituting these values into the equation $y = mx + b$, we get $0 = (-2)(5) + b$.\n4. Solving for $b$, we get $b = 10$.\n5. Therefore, the $y$-intercept point of the line is $(0,10)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(0,10)}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right.
