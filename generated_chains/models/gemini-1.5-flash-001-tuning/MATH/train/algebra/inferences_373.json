At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the polynomial $x^2-5x+t$ has only positive integer roots, find the average of all distinct possible values of $t$.",
        "inference": "Let the roots of the polynomial be $r$ and $s$.  Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s=5$ and $rs=t$.  Since $r$ and $s$ are positive integers, the only possibilities for $(r,s)$ are $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,2)$, and $(4,1)$.  The corresponding values of $t$ are 4, 6, 6, and 4, respectively.  The average of these values is $\\frac{4+6+6+4}{4}=\\boxed{5}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Since $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$. These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$. Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\\boxed{5}$."
