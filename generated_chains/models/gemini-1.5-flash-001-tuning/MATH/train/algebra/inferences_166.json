At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

We multiply the average of the first and last terms $\\frac{3+12}{2}$ by the number of terms, $12-3+1=10$. The value of the sum is $\\frac{15}{2}\\cdot10=15\\cdot5=75$, so there are $\\boxed{75}$ logs in the stack."
