        "inference": "For a quadratic to have non-real roots, its discriminant must be negative.  The discriminant of $x^2+bx+9$ is $b^2-4(1)(9) = b^2-36$.  Thus, we want $b^2-36<0$.  Factoring, we get $(b-6)(b+6)<0$.  This inequality holds when one factor is positive and the other is negative.  This occurs when $b \\in \\boxed{(-6,6)}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{(-6,6)}$.

In order for the quadratic to have two non-real roots, the expression under the square root (the discriminant) must be negative. This gives us the inequality \\begin{align*} b^2-4ac&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-4(1)(9)&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-36&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (b+6)(b-6)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\\in\\boxed{(-6, 6)} $."
