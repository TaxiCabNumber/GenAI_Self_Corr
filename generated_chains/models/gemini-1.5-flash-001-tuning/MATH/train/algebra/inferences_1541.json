At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe domain of the equation $y = \\frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4}$ is the set of all real numbers with the exception of the values $x = A$ and $x = B$. What is $A + B$?",
        "inference": "The denominator of the fraction cannot be equal to zero.  We factor the denominator to get $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 2(x - 1)(x - 2)$. The denominator is zero when $x = 1$ or $x = 2$, so $A = 1$ and $B = 2$.  Therefore, $A + B = 1 + 2 = \\boxed{3}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The equation is well-defined unless the denominator of the given expression is equal to $0$, that is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$. Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)"
