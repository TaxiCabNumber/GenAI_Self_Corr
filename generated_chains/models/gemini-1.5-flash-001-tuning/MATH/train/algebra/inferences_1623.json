At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two positive integers plus their sum is 103. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$. We are given that $ab+a+b=103$.  Adding 1 to both sides, we get $ab+a+b+1=104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. Since $a$ and $b$ are less than 20, $a+1$ and $b+1$ are less than 21.  We need to find the factors of 104, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, and 104.  Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so are $a+1$ and $b+1$.  The only relatively prime factors of 104 are 8 and 13, so either $a+1=8$ and $b+1=13$ or vice versa.  In either case, $a+b=11+12=\\boxed{23}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{23}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=103$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 104$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=104$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $104$: $(104,1), (52,2), (26,4), (13,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 3 pairs, which gives $a=12$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{19}$."
