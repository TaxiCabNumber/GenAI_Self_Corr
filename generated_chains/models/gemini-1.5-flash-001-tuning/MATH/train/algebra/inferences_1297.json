        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo numbers have a difference of 3 and a sum of 31. What is the larger of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number. We have the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx - y &= 3 \\\\\nx + y &= 31\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding the two equations, we get:\n\n$$\n2x = 34\n$$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$$\nx = 17\n$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$.  We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$.  Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$.  Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$."
