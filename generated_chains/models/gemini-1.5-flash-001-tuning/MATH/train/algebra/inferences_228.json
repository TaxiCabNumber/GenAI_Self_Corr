I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
        "inference": "The expression $-16t^2+80t+21$ represents a parabola opening downwards, meaning the maximum height is reached at the vertex. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $\\frac{-b}{2a}$. \n\nIn our case, $a = -16$ and $b = 80$, so the $t$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-80}{2(-16)} = 2.5$. To find the maximum height, substitute $t = 2.5$ into the expression for the height:\n\n$-16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 21 = -100 + 200 + 21 = 121$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{121}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
