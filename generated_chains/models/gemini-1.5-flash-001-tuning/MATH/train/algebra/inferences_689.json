At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that for some $a,b,c$ we have $a+b+c = 6$, $ab+ac+bc = 5$ and $abc = -12$. What is $a^3+b^3+c^3$?",
        "inference": "We know that \n $$a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).$$ We also know that $a^2+b^2+c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+ac+bc) = 6^2 - 2(5) = 26.$ \n \n Plugging this in, we find $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3(-12) = 6(26 - 5),$ so $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 126 - 36 = 90$.\n \n Final Answer: $\\boxed{90}$.
