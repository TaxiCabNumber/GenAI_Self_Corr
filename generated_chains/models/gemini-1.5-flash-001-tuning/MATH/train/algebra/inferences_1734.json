At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integers $x$ is $x^2 + 6x + 9$ between 20 and 40?",

If $x$ must be positive, we can see that this expression can take on the value of any perfect square that is greater than or equal to 16.
