At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has a first term of $12$ and a second term of $4.$ A second infinite geometric series has the same first term of $12,$ a second term of $4+n,$ and a sum of four times that of the first series. Find the value of $n.$",

The sum of the first series is $\\frac{12}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}=18$.\n\nThe common ratio of the second series is $\\frac{4+n}{12}$. The sum of the second series is $\\frac{12}{1-\\frac{4+n}{12}}=\\frac{144}{8-n}$.  We are given that this sum is four times that of the first series, so $\\frac{144}{8-n}=4\\cdot 18$.  Solving for $n$, we find $n=\\boxed{2}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that if the the two series have constant ratios of $a$ and $b,$ respectively, then $4\\left( \\frac{12}{1-a} \\right) = \\frac{12}{1-b}.$ Simplifying, $4(1-b)=1-a.$ Substituting in $a= \\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{4+n}{12}=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{n}{12},$ we quickly find that $n=\\boxed{6}.$"

        "inference": "The error in the solution lies in the assumption that the common ratio of the second series is $\\frac{4+n}{12}$. This is incorrect because the second series starts with $4+n$, not $12$.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $r$ be the common ratio of the first series. Then $12r=4$, so $r=\\frac{1}{3}$. The sum of the first series is $\\frac{12}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}=18$.\n\nThe common ratio of the second series is still $\\frac{1}{3}$.  The sum of the second series is $\\frac{4+n}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}=\\frac{3(4+n)}{2}$. We are given that this sum is four times that of the first series, so $\\frac{3(4+n)}{2}=4\\cdot 18$.
