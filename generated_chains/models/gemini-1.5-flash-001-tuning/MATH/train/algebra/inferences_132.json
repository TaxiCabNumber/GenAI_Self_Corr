        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence is $10$. If the fifth term is $5$, what is the sixth term?",
        "inference": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  Then the sum of the first four terms is $4a + 6d = 10$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d = 5$.  Solving the system of equations, we find $a = -1$ and $d = \\frac{3}{2}$.  Therefore, the sixth term is $a + 5d = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the common difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. We can express the first four terms in terms of $x$ and the fifth term: The fourth term is $5-x$, the third is $5-2x$, etc. So, we have $(5-4x) + (5-3x) + (5-2x) + (5-x) = 10$, which simplifies to $-10x = -10$, or $x = 1$. So the sixth term is $5+1 = \\boxed{6}$."
