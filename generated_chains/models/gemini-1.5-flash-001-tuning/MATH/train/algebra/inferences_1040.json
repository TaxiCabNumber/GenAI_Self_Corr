Expanding this product gives  $x^2 + (r+s)x + rs$, and comparing this to the given quadratic tells us that $rs = 36$.  So, we consider all the pairs of distinct integers that multiply to 36, and we compute their sum in each case: \\[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\nr&s&r+s\\\\\\hline\n1&36&37\\\\\n2&18&20\\\\\n3&12&15\\\\\n4&9&13\\end{array}\\] Summing the entries in the final column gives us a total of $\\boxed{85}$."
