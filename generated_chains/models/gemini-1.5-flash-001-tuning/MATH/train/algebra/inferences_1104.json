At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. How many more people will be needed to mow the lawn in 4 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (4)(6)= 24$ because 4 people can mow a lawn in 6 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 4 hours, then we must have $m(4) = 24$, so $m=6$.  Therefore, we need $6-4 = \\boxed{2}$ more people to complete the job in 4 hours."
