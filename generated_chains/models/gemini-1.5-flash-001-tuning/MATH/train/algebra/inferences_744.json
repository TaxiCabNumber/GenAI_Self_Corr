At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes."
