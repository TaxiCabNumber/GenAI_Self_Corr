So, we need to test the signs of three ranges of numbers: $x<-6$, $-6<x<1$, $x>1$. When $x<-6$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality positive. When $-6<x<1$, only $(x-1)$ will be negative, thus making the inequality negative. Finally when $x>1$, both $(x+6)$ and $(x-1)$ will be positive, thus making the inequality positive once again. Therefore, the only range of $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $\\boxed{(-6, 1)}$."
