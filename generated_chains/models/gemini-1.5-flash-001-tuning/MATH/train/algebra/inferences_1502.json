At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$.\n\nThe graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points?",

Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor.
