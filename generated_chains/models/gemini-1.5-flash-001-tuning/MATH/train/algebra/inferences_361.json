At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$. What is the y-intercept of line $a$?",
        "inference": "The slope of line $a$ is 2, since parallel lines have the same slope.  Using the point-slope form, we get the equation of line $a$ as $y-5=2(x-2)$.  Simplifying, we get $y=2x+1$.  Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
