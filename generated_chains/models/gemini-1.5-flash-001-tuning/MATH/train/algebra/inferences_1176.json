At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBetty goes to the store to get flour and sugar.  The amount of flour she buys, in pounds, is at least 6 pounds more than half the amount of sugar, and is no more than twice the amount of sugar.  Find the least number of pounds of sugar that Betty could buy.",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the number of pounds of sugar Betty buys, and let $f$ be the number of pounds of flour she buys. We are given the following inequalities: \n\n* $f \\ge \\frac{1}{2}s + 6$\n* $f \\le 2s$\n\nWe want to find the least possible value of $s$.  Since $f$ is at least $\\frac{1}{2}s + 6$ and no more than $2s$, we can write the inequality:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}s + 6 \\le 2s$$\n\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}s + 6 &\\le 2s \\\\\n6 &\\le \\frac{3}{2}s \\\\\n4 &\\le s\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the least number of pounds of sugar Betty could buy is $\\boxed{4}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose Betty buys $f$ pounds of flour and $s$ pounds of sugar.  From the problem, we have $f \\ge 6+s/2$ and $f \\le 2s$.  Putting these together, we have $2s \\ge f \\ge 6 +s/2$. The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \\[2s \\ge 6 + s/2 \\implies 3s/2 \\ge 6 \\implies s\\ge \\boxed{4}.\\]"
