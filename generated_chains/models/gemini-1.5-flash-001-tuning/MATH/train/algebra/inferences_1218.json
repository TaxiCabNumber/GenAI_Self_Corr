        "ground_truth": "To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations. Hence we must solve the system \\begin{align*}\ny&=-4x, \\\\\ny-2&=12x.\n\\end{align*}Substituting the expression for $y$ in first equation into the second equation, we obtain $-4x-2=12x$. Solving for $x$ we find that $x=-\\frac{1}{8}$. Plugging this into the first expression for $y$ above, we find that $y=-4\\cdot -\\frac{1}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$. So the intersection is $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)}$."
