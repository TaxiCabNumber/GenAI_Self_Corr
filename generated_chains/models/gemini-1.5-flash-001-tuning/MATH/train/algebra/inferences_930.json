At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a jumbo bag of bows, $\\frac{1}{5}$ are red, $\\frac{1}{2}$ are blue, $\\frac{1}{10}$ are green and the remaining 30 are white. How many of the bows are green?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{15}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We add up the fractions of non-red bows and get $\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{2+5+1}{10}=\\frac{8}{10}=\\frac{4}{5}$. So the 30 bows make up $1-\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ of the total bows, and the total number of bows is $5\\times30=150$. The green bows are $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the total, and $\\frac{1}{10}\\times150=15$, so there are $\\boxed{15}$ green bows."
