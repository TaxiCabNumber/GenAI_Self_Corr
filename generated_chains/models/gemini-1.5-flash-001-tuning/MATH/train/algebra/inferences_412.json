I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine had 2 paperclips on Monday, then she had 6 on Tuesday, and her number of paperclips proceeded to triple on each subsequent day. On what day of the week did she first have more than 100 paperclips?",

Thus, any term in this sequence can be represented as $2\\cdot3^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$, where $k+1$ represents the term number (for example, when $k=0$, $2\\cdot3^k = 2$, which is the $k+1=1^\\text{st}$ term of the sequence). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $2\\cdot3^k>100$. Using trial and error, we find that $k=4$, which means that the $4+1=5^\\text{th}$ day is the the one on which Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, or $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
