At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of gallons of coffee a mathematician drinks on any given day is inversely proportional to how much sleep he gets the night before. On Monday, he got 9 hours of sleep and drank 2 gallons of coffee. On Tuesday, he got 6 hours of sleep. How many gallons of coffee did he drink?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $h$ be the amount of sleep the mathematician gets and $g$ be the number of gallons of coffee he drinks. Since $g$ and $h$ are inversely proportional, that means that $gh=k$ for some constant k. From what we know about Monday, we can conclude that $k=9\\cdot2=18$. Consequently, for Tuesday we have $6g=18$, so $g=\\boxed{3}$."
