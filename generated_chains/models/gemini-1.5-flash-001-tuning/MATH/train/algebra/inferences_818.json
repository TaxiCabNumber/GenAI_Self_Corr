At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA lattice point in the $x,y$-plane is a point both of whose coordinates are integers (not necessarily positive).  How many lattice points lie on the graph of the equation $x^2-y^2=47$?",

        "ground_truth": "Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=47$.  Both factors are integers.  The only pairs of factors of $47$ are $(47,1)$ and $(-47,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=47$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-47$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=47$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-47$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the graph."
