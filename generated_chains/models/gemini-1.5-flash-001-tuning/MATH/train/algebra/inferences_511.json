        "inference": "We can rewrite the second equation as $2^2\\cdot2^x + 3\\cdot3^y = 18$, or $4\\cdot2^x + 3\\cdot3^y = 18$.  Subtracting four times the first equation from this equation, we get\n\\[3\\cdot3^y - 12 = 18 - 20.\\]This simplifies to $3^y = 4$, so $y = \\log_3 4$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $2^x=a$ and $3^y=b$.  Since $2^{x+2}=2^2(2^x)$ and $3^{y+1}=3(3^y)$, the equations become\n\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=5,\\\\\n4a+3b&=18.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $3$ and subtracting it from the second equation, we find $a=\\boxed{3}$ and $b = 2$.

        "inference": "You're right! There's an error in the solution. The problem is that we cannot simply subtract four times the first equation from the second.  This is because the coefficients of $2^x$ are different in the two equations. \n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nWe can rewrite the second equation as $2^2\\cdot2^x + 3\\cdot3^y = 18$, or $4\\cdot2^x + 3\\cdot3^y = 18$.  Dividing both sides of the first equation by 2, we get\n\\[2^x + 2 = \\frac{5}{2}.\\]Then $2^x = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $x = \\boxed{-1}$. \n",
