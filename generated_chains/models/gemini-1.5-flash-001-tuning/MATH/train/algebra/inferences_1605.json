        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the number of ants of Species A on Day 0, and let $b$ be the number of ants of Species B on Day 0. We know that $a+b=30$.\n\nOn Day 1, there are $2a$ ants of Species A and $3b$ ants of Species B. On Day 2, there are $2^2a$ ants of Species A and $3^2b$ ants of Species B.  Continuing in this way, we see that on Day 5, there are $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B.  Thus, we have the equation $2^5a+3^5b=3281$.  This gives us the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\na+b&=30 \\\\\n2^5a+3^5b&=3281.\n\\end{align*}\nWe can solve this system by substitution.  Solving the first equation for $a$, we find $a=30-b$.  Substituting this into the second equation, we get\n\\[2^5(30-b)+3^5b=3281.\\]Expanding, we get $960-32b+243b=3281$.  Combining like terms, we get $211b=2321$, so $b=11$.  Substituting this into the equation $a=30-b$, we find $a=19$.  On Day 5, there are $2^5a=2^5\\cdot19=\\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{608}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5."
