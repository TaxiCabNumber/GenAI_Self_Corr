At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graphs of a function $f(x)=3x+b$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at the point $(-3,a)$. Given that $b$ and $a$ are both integers, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Since the graphs of $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at $(-3,a)$, we know that $f(-3) = a$ and $f^{-1}(a) = -3$.  Using the first equation, we have $3(-3) + b = a$, which simplifies to $-9 + b = a$.  Using the second equation, we know that $f(-3) = a$, so $3(-3) + b = a$, which simplifies to $-9 + b = a$.  Since both equations give us $-9 + b = a$, we can solve for $a$ by substituting the first equation into the second:  \\[f(-3) = -9 + b.\\]Since $f(x) = 3x + b$, we have  \\[-9 + b = 3(-3) + b.\\]Solving for $b$, we find $b = 0$.  Substituting this into the equation $-9 + b = a$, we find $a = \\boxed{-9}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{-9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the graph of $f$ contains the point $(-3,a)$, we know that  \\[a=f(-3)=3(-3)+b=b-9.\\]Since the graph of $f^{-1}$ also contains this point we know that $f^{-1}(-3)=a$ or $-3=f(a)$.  Therefore \\[-3=f(a)=3a+b.\\]Substitution for $a$ gives \\[-3=3(b-9)+b=4b-27.\\]Therefore $b=\\frac14(27-3)=6$. This forces \\[a=b-9=6-9=\\boxed{-3}.\\]One could also recall that the graph of $f$ is a line and the graph of $f^{-1}$ is that line reflected through $y=x$.  Since the slopes of these lines are not 1, the lines both intersect $y=x$ at a single point and that point is also the point of intersection of the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.  Therefore the intersection point must be $(-3,-3)$, giving $a=\\boxed{-3}$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it incorrectly assumes $f(x) = 3x + b$. The problem only tells us that the graphs intersect at $(-3,a)$, which means $f(-3) = a$ and $f^{-1}(a) = -3$. \n\nSince $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are inverse functions, we know that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$.  Therefore,  \\[f(f^{-1}(a)) = a.\\]Since $f^{-1}(a) = -3$, this becomes  \\[f(-3) = a.\\]We also know that $f^{-1}(a) = -3$.
