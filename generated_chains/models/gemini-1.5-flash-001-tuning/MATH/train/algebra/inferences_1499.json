At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle with integer leg lengths is called \"cool'' if the number of square units in its area is equal to twice the number of units in the sum of the lengths of its legs. What is the sum of all the different possible areas of cool right triangles?",
        "inference": "Let the legs of the right triangle have lengths $a$ and $b$.  Then the area of the triangle is $\\frac{ab}{2}$, and the sum of the lengths of the legs is $a+b$.  We are given that $\\frac{ab}{2} = 2(a+b)$, so $ab = 4a + 4b$.  Rearranging, we get $ab - 4a - 4b = 0$.  Adding 16 to both sides, we get $ab - 4a - 4b + 16 = 16$, which factors as $(a-4)(b-4) = 16$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integers, both $a-4$ and $b-4$ must be integers.  The only integer pairs $(a-4,b-4)$ that satisfy $(a-4)(b-4) = 16$ are $(1,16)$, $(2,8)$, $(4,4)$, $(8,2)$, and $(16,1)$.  The corresponding pairs $(a,b)$ are $(5,20)$, $(6,12)$, $(8,8)$, $(12,6)$, and $(20,5)$.  Since the area of a right triangle is independent of the order of the legs, the possible areas are $\\frac{5\\cdot20}{2} = 50$, $\\frac{6\\cdot12}{2} = 36$, and $\\frac{8\\cdot8}{2} = 32$.  The sum of these areas is $50+36+32 = \\boxed{118}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{118}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the leg lengths of the right triangle be $a$ and $b.$ It follows that $\\frac{ab}{2}=2(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side, $ab-4a-4b=0.$ Adding 16 to both sides allows us to factor: \\[a(b-4)-4(b-4)=(a-4)(b-4)=16. \\] From this point, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(5,20),$ $(6,12),$ and $(8,8),$ and the sum of the possible areas is $50 + 36 + 32 = \\boxed{118}$."
