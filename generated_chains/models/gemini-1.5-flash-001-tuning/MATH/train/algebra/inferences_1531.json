The equation of the resulting parabola is $y = (x + 1)^2 + 1$.  The zeros of this parabola are at $x = -2$ and $x = 0$, so $a + b = \\boxed{-2}$.  \n",

To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$.

        "inference": "Here's the breakdown of the solution and the correction:\n\n**The Error:**\n\nThe solution assumes that the parabola opens upwards, leading to the incorrect conclusion that the zeros are at $x=-2$ and $x=0$. This is not necessarily true.\n\n**Corrected Solution:**\n\nSince rotating the parabola 180 degrees about its vertex leaves it unchanged, the parabola must be symmetric about its vertex. This means it opens either upwards or downwards.  Furthermore, the vertex is at $(2,3)$ and the parabola is shifted 3 units to the left and 2 units down to obtain the equation $y = (x + 1)^2 + 1$. This means the parabola opens upwards. \n\nNow, let's find the zeros of the parabola. We set $y=0$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$$0 = (x + 1)^2 + 1$$\n$$-1 = (x + 1)^2$$\n\nSince the square of a real number cannot be negative, this equation has no real solutions.  Therefore, the parabola has **no zeros**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  Since the parabola has no zeros, there is no $a$ and $b$ to add. Therefore, $a+b$ is undefined. \n",
