At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "To find the intersection, we must find the point satisfying both equations. Hence we must solve the system \\begin{align*}\n2y&=-x+3, \\\\\n-y&=5x+1.\n\\end{align*}Adding two times the second equation to the first, we get $2y+2(-y)=-x+3+2(5x+1)$, which simplifies to $0=9x+5$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=-\\frac{5}{9}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $-y=5\\cdot -\\frac{5}{9}+1=-\\frac{16}{9}$. So the intersection is $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{5}{9}, \\frac{16}{9}\\right)}$."
