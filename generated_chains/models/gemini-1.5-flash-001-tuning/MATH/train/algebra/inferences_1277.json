Express your answer in the form $ax^2+bx+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers.",
        "inference": "Since $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 2, we can write it as $f(x) = x^2 + bx + c$ for some constants $b$ and $c$.  We are given that $f(0) = 4$, so $c = 4$.  We are also given that $f(1) = 10$, so $1 + b + 4 = 10$.  Solving for $b$, we find $b = 5$.  Therefore, $f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x^2 + 5x + 4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ has degree $2$, we know it is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$. A monic polynomial is one whose leading coefficient is $1$, so $a=1$. Since $f(0)=4$, we know $1(0)^2+b(0)+c=4$, so $c=4$. Since $f(1)=10$, we know $1(1)^2+b(1)+4=10$, so $b+5=10$ and $b=5$. Thus $f(x)=\\boxed{x^2+5x+4}$."
