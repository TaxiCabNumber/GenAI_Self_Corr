At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two positive integers plus their sum is 95. The integers are relatively prime, and each is less than 20. What is the sum of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$.  We are given that $xy + x + y = 95$.  Adding 1 to both sides, we get\n\\[xy + x + y + 1 = 96.\\]This factors as $(x + 1)(y + 1) = 96$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime, $x + 1$ and $y + 1$ are also relatively prime.  The only way to factor 96 into two relatively prime factors is $96 = 8 \\cdot 12$.  Thus, $x + 1 = 8$ and $y + 1 = 12$, so $x = 7$ and $y = 11$.  The sum of the two integers is $7 + 11 = \\boxed{18}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let our numbers be $a$ and $b$ with $a>b.$ Then $ab+a+b=95$. With Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick in mind, we add $1$ to both sides and get $ab+a+b+1 = 96$, which factors as $(a+1)(b+1)=96$. We consider pairs $(a+1, b+1)$ of factors of $96$: $(96,1), (48,2), (32,3), (24,4), (16,6), \\text{and} (12,8)$. Since $a<20$, we can rule out the first 4 pairs. The pair $(16,6)$ gives us $a=15, b=5$ which doesn't work because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so we are left with the last pair, which gives $a=11$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{18}$."
