        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo lines have the same non-zero $y$-intercept. The first line has a slope of 10 and an $x$-intercept of $(s, 0)$. The second line has a slope of 6 and an $x$-intercept of $(t, 0)$. What is the ratio of $s $ to $t$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let the $y$-intercept of the lines be $(0,b)$.  Then the equation of the first line is $y=10x+b$, and the equation of the second line is $y=6x+b$.  Substituting $(s,0)$ into the equation of the first line gives $0=10s+b$, so $b=-10s$.  Substituting $(t,0)$ into the equation of the second line gives $0=6t+b$, so $b=-6t$.  Therefore, $-10s=-6t$, so $\\frac{s}{t}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The equation of the first line is $y = 10 x + b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept of the two lines.  Since $(s, 0)$ lies on the line, we can plug this into the line's equation to get $0 = 10s + b\\Rightarrow s = -\\frac b{10}$.  Similarly, the second line has equation  $y = 6 x + b$.  Plugging $(t, 0)$ into this equation gives $0 = 6t + b \\Rightarrow t = - \\frac b6$.  Thus $\\frac st = -\\frac b{10} \\cdot - \\frac 6b = \\boxed{\\frac 35}$."
