At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Factoring the left hand side gives $(x+3)(x-2)=0$, so $x=2$ (since we stated the $x$ was non-negative). By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2$. So we just have to consider the integer $x$ values between these two bounds and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.\n\nFor $x=-2$, there is 1 point that works: $(-2,2)$. For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=5$, so all $y$ values between 1 and 5 inclusive work, for a total of 5 points. For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+6$ is $y=6$, so all $y$ values between 0 and 6 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points. By symmetry, when $x=1$, there are 5 points that work, and when $x=2$, there is 1 point that works.\n\nIn total, there are $1+5+7+5+1=\\boxed{19}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary."
