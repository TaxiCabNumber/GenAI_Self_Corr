        "inference": "Let the roots of the quadratic be $k$ and $k+1$.  Then by Vieta's formulas, $k+(k+1)=n$ and $k(k+1)=m$.  Solving the first equation, we find $k=\\frac{n-1}{2}$.  Since $k$ is an integer, $n$ must be odd.  Also, $m=k(k+1)=\\frac{n-1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{n+1}{2}=\\frac{n^2-1}{4}$.  Since $m$ is divisible by 3, $n^2-1$ must be divisible by 12.  This means that $n^2-1$ must be divisible by both 3 and 4.\n\nIf $n^2-1$ is divisible by 3, then $n$ must be congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3.  If $n^2-1$ is divisible by 4, then $n$ must be odd.  Therefore, the possible values of $n$ less than 100 are 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 55, 59, 61, 65, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 89, 91, 95, and 97.

        "ground_truth": "In the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$, the roots sum to $\\frac{-b}{a}$ and multiply to $\\frac{c}{a}$. Therefore, for $x^2-nx+m$, we know that the sum of the roots is $n$ and the product of the roots is $m$. The requirement that $n$ be an integer with $0<n<100$ along with the requirement that the roots are consecutive positive integers leaves us with 49 possible values of $n$: $(1+2), (2+3), (3+4),...,(48+49),(49+50)$. Of these values of $n$, the corresponding value of $m$ would be $(1\\ast2), (2\\ast3), (3\\ast4),...,(48\\ast49), (49\\ast50)$. In order for $m$ to be divisible by 3, thus, one of the roots has to be divisible by three. The values of $n$ in $(2+3), (3+4), (5+6), ... ,(48+49)$ satisfy that requirement, but in $(1+2), (4+5), ... ,(49+50)$ they do not. This eliminates one third of the possibilities for $n$. Since $n=(49+50)$ is disqualified, we are left with $48-(48\\div 3) = 48-16=\\boxed{32}$ possible values of $n$."
