At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen three numbers are added two at a time the sums are 29, 46, and 53. What is the sum of all three numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the three numbers be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We are given:\n\n* $a + b = 29$\n* $a + c = 46$\n* $b + c = 53$\n\nAdding all three equations, we get:\n\n$2a + 2b + 2c = 128$\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n$a + b + c = 64$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If we let our three numbers be $x$, $y$, and $z$, we have that $x+y=29$, $y+z=46$, and $z+x=53$. Adding these three equations together, we get that $(x+y)+(y+z)+(z+x)=29+46+53$, so $2x+2y+2z=128$. If we then divide both sides of this equation by $2$, we are left with the equation $x+y+z=64$. Therefore, the sum of the three numbers must equal $\\boxed{64}$."
