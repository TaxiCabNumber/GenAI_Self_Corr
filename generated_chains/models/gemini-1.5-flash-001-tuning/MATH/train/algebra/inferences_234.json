        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn airplane has three sections: First Class (24 seats), Business Class ($25\\%$ of the total number of seats) and Economy ($\\frac{2}{3}$ of the total number of seats). How many seats does the plane have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the total number of seats on the plane. \n\nThe number of seats in Business Class is $0.25x$. \n\nThe number of seats in Economy is $\\frac{2}{3}x$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seats on the plane can be represented as:\n\n$x = 24 + 0.25x + \\frac{2}{3}x$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we need to combine the terms with $x$ on one side of the equation:\n\n$x - 0.25x - \\frac{2}{3}x = 24$\n\n$\\frac{1}{12}x = 24$\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation by 12:\n\n$x = 24 \\cdot 12$\n\n$x = 288$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{288}$. I hope it is correct.** \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the airplane has $s$ seats.  Then we have that $24 + 0.25 s + \\frac{2}{3} s = s$.  Solving, we find that $s = \\boxed{288}$."

        "inference": "The error is that the equation is missing a term to account for the 24 seats that are neither Business Class nor Economy.
