At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
        "inference": "Let $w$ be the width of the rectangle. The length is $w+15$. The area of the rectangle is $w(w+15)$. We want to find the minimum value of $w$ such that $w(w+15)\\ge100$.  We can rewrite the inequality as $w^2+15w-100\\ge0$. Factoring, we have $(w+20)(w-5)\\ge0$. The solutions to the equation $(w+20)(w-5)=0$ are $w=-20$ and $w=5$. Since the width cannot be negative, the solution $w=-20$ is extraneous.  Thus, the width must be at least 5 ft.  Since we are trying to use the least amount of material, the width should be as small as possible.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft."
