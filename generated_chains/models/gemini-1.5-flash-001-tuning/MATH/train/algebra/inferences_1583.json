At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Solution:\nFrom the first equation, we get $x+y=3xy.$  Substituting this into the second equation gives $3xy+3xy=4$, so $xy=\\frac{2}{3}$.  Then\n\\[x^2y+xy^2=xy(x+y)=xy(3xy)=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(3\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}.\\]",
        "ground_truth": "The first equation becomes\n\n$$\\frac{x+y}{xy}=3\\Rightarrow x+y=3xy$$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation,\n\n$$4xy=4\\Rightarrow xy=1$$\n\nThus $x+y=3$.\n\nThe quantity we desire factors as $xy(x+y)$, so it is equal to $1(3)=\\boxed{3}$."
