Solving for $x$ we have: \\begin{align*}\nx^2+4x+4=2x+4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2+2x=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x(x+2)=0\\\\\n\\end{align*}So, $x=-2$ or $x=0$. Checking these solutions, we find that $3^0=9^0$ and $3^4=9^2$, which are both true statements. The sum of all possible values of $x$ is $-2+0=\\boxed{-2}$."
