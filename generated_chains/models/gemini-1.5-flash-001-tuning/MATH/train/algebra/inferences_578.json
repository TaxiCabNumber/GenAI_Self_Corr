At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $12$ and their difference is $20$. What is the smaller number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number.  We are given the system of equations \n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 12 \\\\\nx - y &= 20.\n\\end{align*}Adding the equations, we get $2x = 32,$ so $x = 16.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get $16 + y = 12,$ so $y = -4.$  Therefore, the smaller number is $\\boxed{-4}.$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number. Then we have $x+y=12$ and $x-y=20$. If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get $$x+y-(x-y)=12-20\\qquad\\Rightarrow 2y=-8\\qquad\\Rightarrow y=-4.$$ The smaller number is $\\boxed{-4}$."
