        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a$ and $b$ be the solutions of the equation $2x^2+6x-14=0$. What is the value of $(2a-3)(4b-6)$?",
        "inference": "We can use Vieta's formulas to simplify the expression.  Vieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.  Therefore, for our equation $2x^2+6x-14=0$, we have $a+b=-6/2=-3$ and $ab=-14/2=-7$.\n\nNow, we can expand the given expression:\n\n$$(2a-3)(4b-6) = 8ab - 12a - 12b + 18$$\n\nWe can substitute the values we found for $a+b$ and $ab$:\n\n$$8ab - 12a - 12b + 18 = 8(-7) - 12(-3) + 18 = \\boxed{6}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$. This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $-6/2=-3$ and $-14/2=-7$, respectively. Thus, the desired expression equals $(8\\cdot -7) - (12 \\cdot -3) + 18 = \\boxed{-2}$."
