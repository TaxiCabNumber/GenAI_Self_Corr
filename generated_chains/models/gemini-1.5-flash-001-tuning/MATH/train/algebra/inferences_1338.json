        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular box has a volume of $4320$ cubic inches and a surface area of $1704$ square inches. The sum of the lengths of its $12$ edges is $208$ inches. What would be the volume of the box, in cubic inches, if its length, width and height were each increased by one inch?",
        "inference": "Let the length, width, and height of the box be $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. We are given that $lwh = 4320$, $2lw + 2wh + 2lh = 1704$, and $4l + 4w + 4h = 208$.  Simplifying the second equation, we get $lw + wh + lh = 852$.  Simplifying the third equation, we get $l + w + h = 52$.\n\nWe can write the sum of the lengths of the edges as $4l + 4w + 4h = 4(l + w + h) = 4(52) = 208$, which confirms the given information.\n\nWe want to find $(l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1)$.  Expanding this, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n(l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1) &= lwh + lw + lh + wh + l + w + h + 1 \\\\\n&= 4320 + 852 + 52 + 1 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{5225}.\n\\end{align*}Final Answer: $\\boxed{5225}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We label the length $l$, the width $w$, and the height $h$. We are given that $l \\cdot w \\cdot h =4320$, thus we have that $2lw+2wh+2hl = 1704$ and $lw+wh+hl = 852.$ Also, $4l+4w+4h=208,$ so $l+w+h=52$.\n\nWe want to find what the volume will be if we increase all of the sides by an inch. So we have, \\begin{align*}\n(l+1)(w+1)(h+1)&=lwh+lh+wh+lw+w+l+h+1\\\\\n&=4320+852+52+1\\\\\n&=\\boxed{5225 \\text{ cubic inches}}.\n\\end{align*}"
