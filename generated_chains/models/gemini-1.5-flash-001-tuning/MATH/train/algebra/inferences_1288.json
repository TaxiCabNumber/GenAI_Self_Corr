So, we compare $(3x+b)^2$ to $9x^2 + 24x + a$. Expanding $(3x+b)^2$ gives \\[(3x+b)^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(b) + b^2 = 9x^2 + 6bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $9x^2+24x+a$, we have $6bx=24x$, so $b=4$.  Equating the constant term of $9x^2 + 6bx + b^2$ to that of $9x^2 + 24x+a$ gives us $a=b^2 = \\boxed{16}$."
