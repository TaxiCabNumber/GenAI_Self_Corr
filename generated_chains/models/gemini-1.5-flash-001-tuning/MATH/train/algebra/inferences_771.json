At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The greatest integer smaller than $15$ is $14$, so the largest integer (smaller than $225$) that would not satisfy $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$ would be $14^2$, or $196$. Therefore, any integer that is in the range $196 < x \\leq 225$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$. Since there are 29 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\\boxed{29}$."
