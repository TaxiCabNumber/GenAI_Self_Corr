At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSamson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "Solution: \nThe utility Samson gets on Monday is $(8-t)t$.  The utility Samson gets on Tuesday is $(2-t)(t+3)$.  We are given that these two utilities are equal, so $(8-t)t=(2-t)(t+3)$.  Expanding both sides gives $8t-t^2=2t+6-t^2-3t$, which simplifies to $9t=6$.  Hence, $t=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
