At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$. What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?",

Since we know $f(4)=7$, let's try $x=1$.  Then $4x=4$, and we have  \\[2y=3f(4)+5=3(7)+5=26.\\] So, $y=13$, and the point $(1,13)$ is on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$.
