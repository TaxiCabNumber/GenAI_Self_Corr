At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive integers $A, B$ and $C$ form an arithmetic sequence while the integers $B, C$ and $D$ form a geometric sequence. If $\\frac CB = \\frac 53,$ what is the smallest possible value of $A + B + C + D$?",

        "ground_truth": "It follows that the common ratio of the geometric sequence is equal to $\\frac 53$. Thus, $D = \\frac 53 \\cdot C = \\frac 53 \\cdot \\frac 53 \\cdot B = \\frac{25B}{9}$. Since $D$ is an integer, it follows that $B$ must be divisible by $9$. The lowest possible value of $B$ is $B = 9$, which yields a value of $C = 15$ and $D = 25$. The common difference between the first three terms is thus $15 - 9 = 6$, so it follows that $A = B - 6 = 3$. The sum $A+B+C+D = 3+9+15+25 = \\boxed{52}$.\n\nIf $B = 9k$ for $k > 1$, then $C = \\frac 53 \\cdot B = 15k$ and $D = \\frac 53 \\cdot C = 25k$. Then, $A+B+C+D > B+C+D \\ge 49k \\ge 98$, so it follows that $52$ is indeed the smallest possible value of $A+B+C+D$."
