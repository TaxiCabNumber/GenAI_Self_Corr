At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the beginning of my bike ride I feel good, so I can travel   20 miles per hour.  Later, I get tired and travel only 12 miles  per hour.  If I travel a total of 122 miles in a total time of   8 hours, for how many hours did I feel good?  Express your  answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of hours you felt good.  Then you were tired for $8-x$ hours.  Since distance equals rate times time, we have the equation $20x + 12(8-x) = 122$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{4}}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{4}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ equal the number of hours that you felt good riding.  Then, $x$ hours were spent traveling at 20 mph, and $8-x$ hours were spent traveling at 12 mph.  During this time, a total of 122 miles was traveled.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, we can add the two distances, set this equal to 122 miles, and solve for $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n20(x)+12(8-x)&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 20x+96-12x&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x&=26\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=26/8=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}\n\\end{align*}"

        "inference": "The error is that the solution assumes you travel at a constant speed for the entire 8 hours.  However, the problem states that you travel at 20 miles per hour when you feel good and 12 miles per hour when you are tired.  Therefore, you need to account for the time spent traveling at each speed.\n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nLet $x$ be the number of hours you feel good.  Then you are tired for $8-x$ hours.  You travel $20x$ miles while feeling good and $12(8-x)$ miles while tired.  The total distance traveled is 122 miles, so we have the equation $20x + 12(8-x) = 122$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\boxed{5}$. \n",
