We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(7-3)^2 + (10-5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of $\\sqrt{41}$, the radius must have length $\\sqrt{41}/2$.
