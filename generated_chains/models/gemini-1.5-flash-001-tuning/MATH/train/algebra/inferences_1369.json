At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the range of the function $$r(x) = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "The denominator of $r(x)$ can never be zero, so we need to exclude $x=1$ from the domain.  However, for all other values of $x$, $(1-x)^2$ is positive, and hence $\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$ is also positive.  Moreover, as $x$ gets closer and closer to 1, $(1-x)^2$ gets closer and closer to 0, so $\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$ gets larger and larger without bound.  Therefore, the range of $r(x)$ is all positive real numbers.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every real number can be expressed in the form $1-x$ for some real $x$. Thus, as $x$ runs through the real numbers, $(1-x)^2$ runs through all nonnegative values, and its reciprocal (which is $r(x)$) runs through all positive values. The range of $r(x)$ is $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
