I hope it is correct.'\nA piece of cheese is located at $(12,10)$ in a coordinate plane.  A mouse is at $(4,-2)$ and is running  up  the line $y=-5x+18$.  At the point $(a,b)$ the mouse starts getting farther from the cheese rather than closer to it. What is $a + b$?",
        "inference": "The mouse is getting closer to the cheese as long as it is moving in the direction of the cheese. This means the slope of the line connecting the mouse's position to the cheese must be the same as the slope of the line the mouse is traveling on.\n\nThe slope of the line connecting the mouse's position $(4,-2)$ to the cheese $(12,10)$ is $\\frac{10 - (-2)}{12 - 4} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe mouse is traveling on the line $y = -5x + 18$, which has a slope of $-5$. \n\nThe mouse will start getting farther from the cheese when the slope of the line connecting the mouse to the cheese is equal to the slope of the line the mouse is traveling on.  We want to find the point $(a,b)$ on the line $y = -5x + 18$ where the slope between $(a,b)$ and $(12,10)$ is $-5$.\n\nThis gives us the equation $\\frac{10 - b}{12 - a} = -5$.  Solving for $b$ we find $b = 60 + 5a$.  Substituting this into $y = -5x + 18$, we get $60 + 5a = -5a + 18$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = -4.2$.  Substituting back in to find $b$, we find $b = 39$.  Therefore, $a + b = -4.2 + 39 = 34.8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34.8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The  point $(a,b)$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $(12,10)$ to the line $y=-5x+18$.  The perpendicular has slope $\\frac{1}{5}$, so its equation is \\[\ny=10+\\frac{1}{5}(x-12)=\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}.\n\\]The $x$-coordinate at the foot of the perpendicular satisfies the equation \\[\n\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{38}{5}=-5x+18,\n\\]so $x=2$ and $y=-5\\cdot2+18=8$. Thus $(a,b) = (2,8)$, and $a+b = \\boxed{10}$."

        "inference": "The error is in assuming that the mouse will start getting farther from the cheese when the slopes are equal.  The mouse starts getting farther when the slope of the line connecting the mouse to the cheese is *less* than the slope of the line the mouse is traveling on.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe slope of the line connecting the mouse's position $(4,-2)$ to the cheese $(12,10)$ is $\\frac{10 - (-2)}{12 - 4} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe mouse is traveling on the line $y = -5x + 18$, which has a slope of $-5$. \n\nWe want to find the point $(a,b)$ on the line $y = -5x + 18$ where the slope between $(a,b)$ and $(12,10)$ is *less* than $-5$.  \n\nThis means $\\frac{10 - b}{12 - a} < -5$.  Solving for $b$, we get $b > 60 + 5a$.  Substituting this into $y = -5x + 18$, we get $60 + 5a < -5a + 18$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a < -4.2$.\n\nSince the mouse is moving to the left, we need to find the smallest value of $a$ such that $a < -4.2$.  This value is  $a = -4.2$. Substituting back in to find $b$, we find $b = 39$.  Therefore, $a + b = -4.2 + 39 = 34.8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34.8}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
