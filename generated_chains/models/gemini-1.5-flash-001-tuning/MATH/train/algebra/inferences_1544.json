At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRamon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $\\$$2.50 and he sells three enchiladas and two tacos for $\\$$2.70. Assuming a fixed price per item, what is the cost, in dollars, of three enchiladas and four tacos? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the price of an enchilada and $y$ be the price of a taco.  We can set up a system of equations: \n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 2.50 \\\\\n3x + 2y &= 2.70 \n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by $-2$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x + 9y &= 7.50 \\\\\n-6x - 4y &= -5.40\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding the equations, we get $5y = 2.10$, so $y = 0.42$.  Substituting into the first equation, we get $2x + 3(0.42) = 2.50$, so $2x = 1.24$ and $x = 0.62$.\n\nThe cost of three enchiladas and four tacos is $3(0.62) + 4(0.42) = 3.42$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3.42}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that a taco costs $t$ dollars and and enchiladas cost $e$ dollars each.  Then the given information implies that $2e + 3t = 2.50$ and $3e + 2t = 2.70$.  Multiplying the first equation by 3 yields $6e + 9t = 7.50$, and multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $6e + 4t = 5.40$.  Subtracting these two equations, we see that $5t = 2.10$.  Thus one taco costs $\\frac{2.10}{5} = .42$, and two tacos are $.84$.  Since we are given the price of three enchiladas and two tacos, we see that three enchiladas and four tacos total $2.70 + .84 = \\boxed{\\$3.54}$."
