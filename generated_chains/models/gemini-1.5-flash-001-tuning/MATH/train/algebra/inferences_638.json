At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given below, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers.

        "inference": "The graph intersects the $y$-axis at $(0,-1)$.  This means that $c=-1$.  The graph also intersects the $x$-axis at $(-1,0)$.  This means that  \\[0 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) - 1.\\] This simplifies to $a - b = 1$.  Finally, the graph has a minimum at $(-1,-2)$.  This means that the vertex of the parabola is at $(-1,-2)$.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\\frac{b}{2a}$, so \\[-1 = -\\frac{b}{2a}.\\] This simplifies to $b = 2a$.  Substituting this into $a - b = 1$, we get $a - 2a = 1$, so $a = \\boxed{-1}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The vertex of the parabola appears to be at the value $(-1,-2)$.  Therefore, it is the graph of \\[y=a(x+1)^2-2\\] for some integer $a$.  We also know that $(0,-1)$ is on the graph, so \\[-1=a(0+1)^2-2=a-2.\\] Therefore  \\[a=\\boxed{1}.\\]"
