At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can write $4^{x-4}$ as $(2^2)^{x-4} = 2^{2x - 8}$.  Then the equation becomes $2^{x^2 - 3x - 2} = 2^{2x - 8}$.  Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal: \\[x^2 - 3x - 2 = 2x - 8.\\]This simplifies to $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$, which factors as $(x-2)(x-3) = 0$.  Thus, the solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = 3$, and their sum is $2 + 3 = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Writing the right hand side with 2 as the base, we have $4^{x-4} = (2^2)^{x-4} = 2^{2(x-4)} = 2^{2x-8}$, so our equation is $$2^{x^2-3x-2} = 2^{2x - 8}.$$Then, by setting the exponents equal to each other, we obtain $$x^2 - 3x - 2 = 2x - 8.$$This gives the quadratic $$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.$$Factoring gives $(x-2)(x-3)=0$, which has solutions $x = 2,3$.  The sum of these solutions is $\\boxed{5}$."
