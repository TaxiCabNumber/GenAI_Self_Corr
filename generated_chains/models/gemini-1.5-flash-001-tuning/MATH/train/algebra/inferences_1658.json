The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of $3000\\text{ km}$ from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of $3250\\text{ km}$ from $A.$ To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.
