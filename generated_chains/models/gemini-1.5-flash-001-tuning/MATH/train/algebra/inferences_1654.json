        "ground_truth": "Consider the quadratic formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In order for the quadratic to have real roots, the expression underneath the square root (the discriminant) must be either positive or equal to zero. Thus, this gives us the inequality \\begin{align*} b^2-4ac&\\ge0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-4(1)(16)&\\ge0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad b^2-64&\\ge0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (b+8)(b-8)&\\ge0\n\\end{align*} Thus, we find that $ b\\in\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8]\\cup [8,\\infty)} $."
