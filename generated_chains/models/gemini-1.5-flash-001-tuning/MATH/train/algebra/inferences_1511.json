At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a square equals the square of a length of the side of the square. The perimeter of a square equals the sum of the lengths of all four sides. The sum of the areas of two squares is 65, while the difference in their areas is 33.  Find the sum of their perimeters.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the side length of the larger square and $y$ be the side length of the smaller square. \n\nWe are given that the sum of the areas of the two squares is 65, so we have the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 65$.\n\nWe are also given that the difference in their areas is 33, so we have the equation $x^2 - y^2 = 33$.\n\nAdding the two equations together, we get $2x^2 = 98$.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2 = 49$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = 7$.\n\nSubstituting $x=7$ into the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 65$, we get $49 + y^2 = 65$.  Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get $y^2 = 16$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $y = 4$.\n\nThe perimeter of the larger square is $4x = 4(7) = 28$.  The perimeter of the smaller square is $4y = 4(4) = 16$.\n\nThe sum of the perimeters of the two squares is $28 + 16 = 44$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{44}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the side length of the larger square be $x$ and the side length of the smaller square be $y$.  We are told $x^2 + y^2 = 65$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 33$.  Adding these two equations gives $2x^2 = 98$, so $x^2 = 49$. Since $x$ must be positive, we have $x=7$. Substituting this into either equation above gives us $y^2 = 16$.  Since $y$ must be positive, we have $y=4$.  The perimeter of the larger square is $4x$ and that of the smaller square is $4y$, so the sum of their perimeters is $4x+4y = 4(x+y) = \\boxed{44}$."
