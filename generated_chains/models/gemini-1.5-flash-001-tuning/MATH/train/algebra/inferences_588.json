        "inference": "First, we factor the quadratic: $n^2 - 35n + 306 = (n - 17)(n - 18)$. Since we want this product to be prime, one of the factors must be 1.  The only possible value of $n$ is then $n = 18$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First we note that since $n^2-35n = n(n-35)$, and at least one of $n$ and $n-35$ is even, thus $n^2-35n$ is even. So $n^2-35n+306$ is also even. Thus the prime $p$ must equal 2. This means that we want the product of the positive integral solutions to $n^2-35n+306=2$, or $n^2-35n+304=0$.\n\nThe problem tells us that there is at least one positive integral solution. Now we use the fact that the product of the solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $c/a$, which equals 304 in this case. This means that both solutions must in fact be positive, since if only one were, their product would be negative. Additionally, the sum of the solutions is given by $-b/a$, which is 35 in this case. Since one solution is integral, and the sum of both solutions is integral, the other solution is integral as well. So we want the product of both, which is $\\boxed{304}$."

        "inference": "The error is that the problem asks for the value of $n$ which makes the *expression* $n^2 - 35n + 306$ prime. The factorization is helpful but not the end of the story.\n\nWe have $(n - 17)(n - 18)$. For this product to be prime, one of the factors must be 1 or -1.  If $n - 17 = 1$, then $n = 18$, and if $n - 17 = -1$, then $n = 16$.  If $n - 18 = 1$, then $n = 19$, and if $n - 18 = -1$, then $n = 17$.  We must check if any of these values of $n$ make the expression prime. \n\nWe find that $17^2 - 35(17) + 306 = 1$ and $18^2 - 35(18) + 306 = -1$, so the expression is prime for both $n = 17$ and $n = 18$.  The final answer is $\\boxed{17, 18}$. \n",
