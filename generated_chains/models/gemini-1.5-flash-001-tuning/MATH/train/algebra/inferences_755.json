At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven identical bowling balls weigh the same as four identical canoes. If three of the canoes weigh a total of 84 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe. We have that $7b=4c$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$, we have $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 7b=\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 4c \\Rightarrow \\frac{21}{4}b=3c=84$. Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\\boxed{16}$ pounds."
