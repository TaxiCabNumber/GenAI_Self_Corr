        "inference": "Let the two fractions be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x+y=\\frac{11}{12}$ and $xy=\\frac{1}{6}$.  We can use the fact that $(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2$ to solve for $x^2+y^2$.  Substituting, we get  \\[\\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^2=x^2+2\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}+y^2,\\]so $x^2+y^2=\\frac{121}{144}-\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{73}{144}$.  We can now find $(x-y)^2$ by expanding: \\[(x-y)^2=x^2-2xy+y^2=\\frac{73}{144}-2\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{25}{144}.\\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-y=\\pm\\frac{5}{12}$. Since $x+y=\\frac{11}{12}$, we can add the two equations to get $2x=\\frac{16}{12}=\\frac{4}{3}$, so $x=\\frac{2}{3}$.  Subtracting the equations, we get $2y=\\frac{6}{12}=\\frac{1}{2}$, so $y=\\frac{1}{4}$.  The lesser of the two fractions is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We can make use of the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.  Choosing $a$, $b$, and $c$ so that $-b/a=11/12$ and $c/a=1/6$, we find that the fractions are the solutions to $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$. Factoring this, we get \\[ 12x^2 - 11x + 2 = (3x - 2)(4x - 1). \\] Therefore, the solutions of $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$ are $x=\\frac{1}{4}$ and $x=\\frac{2}{3}$.  The smaller of these fractions is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\n\nAn alternative way to obtain the equation $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$ is to begin with the given equations $x+y=\\frac{11}{12}$ and $xy=\\frac{1}{6}$.  Solve the first equation for $y$ and substitute $y=\\frac{11}{12}-x$ into the second equation.  Distributing, clearing denominators, and rearranging gives $12x^2 - 11x + 2=0$. Then we proceed as before."
