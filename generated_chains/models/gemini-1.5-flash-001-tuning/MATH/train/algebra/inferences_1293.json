I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $a > 0$, if $f(g(a)) = 8$, where $f(x) = x^2 + 8$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 4$, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "We know that $f(g(a)) = 8$, so let's substitute $g(a)$ into the function $f(x)$.  We have $f(g(a)) = (g(a))^2 + 8 = 8$.  Simplifying, we get $(g(a))^2 = 0$.  Since $g(a) = a^2 - 4$, we have $(a^2 - 4)^2 = 0$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $a^2 - 4 = 0$.  Adding 4 to both sides, we have $a^2 = 4$.

        "inference": "The error is in assuming that $f(x) = x^2 + 8$. We are not given any information about the function $f(x)$. \n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nWe are given that $f(g(a)) = 8$ and $g(a) = a^2 - 4$. \n\nSince $f(g(a)) = 8$, we know that $g(a)$ is the input to the function $f(x)$ that produces an output of 8. However, we have no information about the function $f(x)$ itself. \n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the value of $a$ without more information about the function $f(x)$. \n\n**Final Answer:** There is not enough information to determine the value of $a$.  \n",
