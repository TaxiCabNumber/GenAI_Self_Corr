At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn 1960, there were 450,000 cases of measles reported in the U.S. In 1996, there were 500 cases reported. How many cases of measles would have been reported in 1987 if the number of cases reported from 1960 to 1996 decreased linearly?",

So, over the course of $1987-1960=27$, the number of cases would decrease by $\\frac{27}{36}\\cdot(449,\\!500)=337,\\!125$ cases.
