At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $x^2+bx+c = 0$ be a quadratic whose roots are each two more than the roots of $3x^2-5x-7$. What is $c$?",

Therefore, $(r+2)+(s+2) = r+s+4 = \\frac{5}{3}+4 = \\frac{17}{3}$ and $(r+2)(s+2) = rs+2(r+s)+4 = -\\frac{7}{3}+2\\cdot\\frac{5}{3}+4 = \\frac{17}{3}$.  Since the sum of the roots of $x^2+bx+c=0$ is $-\\frac{b}{1} = -b$ and the product of the roots is $\\frac{c}{1}=c$, we have $c = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{3}}$.",

Then the roots of $x^2+bx+c$ are $p+2$ and $q+2$, $c/1 = (p+2)(q+2)$. Since $c = c/1$, this means we are looking for $(p+2)(q+2)$. Since $3x^2-5x-7$ is also a quadratic, the sum $p+q$ is given by $-(-5)/3=5/3$ and the product $pq$ is given by $-7/3$. Thus, our answer is $(p+2)(q+2) = pq+2p+2q+4 = (pq)+2(p+q)+4 = (-7/3)+2(5/3)+4 = \\boxed{5}$."
