At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes.  How long, in seconds, does it take six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub?  Assume that all faucets dispense water at the same rate.",

        "ground_truth": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds."
