        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the infinite nested radical converges.  We need to prove that it does converge first.\n\nLet $a_n$ be the result of evaluating the radical with $n$ nested square roots.  Then $a_1 = \\sqrt{2},$ $a_2 = \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}},$ $a_3 = \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}},$ and so on.\n\nWe claim that the sequence $(a_n)$ is decreasing and bounded below by 0.  To see this, note that $a_1 = \\sqrt{2} > 1,$ so\n\\[a_2 = \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} < \\sqrt{2} = a_1.\\]Similarly, $a_3 = \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} < \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} = a_2,$ and so on.  Thus, $(a_n)$ is decreasing.  Also, $a_n$ is the square root of a nonnegative number, so $a_n \\ge 0$ for all $n.$\n\nSince $(a_n)$ is decreasing and bounded below, it converges to some limit $L.$  Then\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2 - L}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get $L^2 = 2 - L,$ or $L^2 + L - 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(L + 2)(L - 1) = 0,$ so $L = -2$ or $L = 1.$  Since $L$ is the limit of a sequence of nonnegative numbers, $L$ must be nonnegative, so $L = \\boxed{1}.$",
