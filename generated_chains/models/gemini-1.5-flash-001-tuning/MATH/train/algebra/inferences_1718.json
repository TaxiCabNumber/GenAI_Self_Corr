At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Bank of Springfield's Super High Yield savings account compounds annually at a rate of one percent.  If Lisa invests 1000 dollars in one of these accounts, then how much interest will she earn after five years?  (Give your answer to the nearest dollar.)",
