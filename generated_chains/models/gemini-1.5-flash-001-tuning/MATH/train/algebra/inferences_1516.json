At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy $x^2-y^2=51$?",

Solving in the first case gives $x=26,y=25$, and the second case gives $x=10,y=7$.  Thus there are $\\boxed{2}$ pairs $(x,y)$ that solve the equation."
