        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Monday, I worked $t-6$ hours and earned $2t-5$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $2t-8$ hours but only earned $t-5$ dollars an hour. As it turns out, we earned the same amount. What is the value of $t$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe know that the total amount earned is equal to the number of hours worked multiplied by the hourly rate.  Since we earned the same amount, we can set up an equation:\n$(t-6)(2t-5)=(2t-8)(t-5)$\nExpanding both sides of the equation:\n$2t^2-17t+30=2t^2-18t+40$\nCombining like terms:\n$t=10$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since we both earned the same amount, \\begin{align*}\n(t-6) (2t-5) &= (2t-8)(t-5) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2t^2-17t+30 &= 2t^2 - 18t+ 40.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{10}$."
