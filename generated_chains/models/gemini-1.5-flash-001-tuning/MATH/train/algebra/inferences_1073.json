        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nReal numbers $a$ and $b$ satisfy the equations $3^a=81^{b+2}$ and $125^b=5^{a-3}$.  What is $ab$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nWe can write $81$ as $3^4$ and $125$ as $5^3$, so our equations become\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3^a &= (3^4)^{b+2} = 3^{4b+8}, \\\\\n5^{3b} &= 5^{a-3}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 4b+8, \\\\\n3b &= a-3.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting $a=4b+8$ into the second equation, we get $3b = (4b+8) - 3$, which simplifies to $b=-5$.  Substituting this back into the equation $a=4b+8$, we get $a=4(-5)+8=-12$.  Therefore, $ab = (-12)(-5) = \\boxed{60}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The given equations are equivalent, respectively, to \\[\n3^a=3^{4(b+2)}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 5^{3b}=5^{a-3}.\n\\] Therefore $a=4(b+2)$ and $3b=a-3$.  The solution of this system is $a=-12$ and $b=-5$, so $ab=\\boxed{60}$."
