We know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.  Therefore, the sum of the roots of our quadratic is $-3/7$ and the product of the roots is $k/7$.  We have \\[\\frac{-3+i\\sqrt{299}}{14} + \\frac{-3-i\\sqrt{299}}{14} = \\frac{-6}{14} = \\frac{-3}{7},\\]which confirms our formula for the sum of the roots.  We also have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{-3+i\\sqrt{299}}{14} \\cdot \\frac{-3-i\\sqrt{299}}{14} &= \\frac{(-3)^2 - (i\\sqrt{299})^2}{14^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{9 + 299}{196} \\\\\n&= \\frac{308}{196} \\\\\n&= \\frac{77}{49} \\\\\n&= \\frac{11}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $k/7 = 11/7$, so $k = \\boxed{11}$. \n",
