        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRichard is building a rectangular backyard from 360 feet of fencing. The fencing must cover three sides of the backyard (the fourth side is bordered by Richard's house). What is the maximum area of this backyard?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the backyard be $l$ and the width be $w$. We know that $2w+l=360$, so $l=360-2w$. The area of the backyard is given by $A=lw = w(360-2w) = 360w-2w^2$. This is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards. The maximum value of the function occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x=\\frac{-b}{2a}$, where $a=-2$ and $b=360$. Therefore, the width that maximizes the area is $w=\\frac{-360}{2(-2)}=90$ feet. Plugging this back into the equation for $l$, we get $l=360-2(90)=180$ feet. The maximum area is then $A=(90)(180)=\\boxed{16,200}$ square feet. Final Answer: $\\boxed{16,200}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the backyard be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $l+2w=360$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular backyard, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=360-2w$. Substituting this into our expression for area, we have \\[(360-2w)(w)=360w-2w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-2$ out, we have \\[-2(w^2-180w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(180/2)^2=8100$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-2(w^2-180w+8100-8100) \\Rightarrow -2(w-90)^2+16200\\]Since the maximum value of $-2(w-90)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 16200, which is achieved when $w=90$ and $l=360-2w=180$. Thus, the maximum area of the backyard is $\\boxed{16200}$ square feet."
