At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlec must purchase 14 identical shirts and only has $\\$130$. There is a flat $\\$2$ entrance fee for shopping at the warehouse store where he plans to buy the shirts.  The price of each shirt is the same whole-dollar amount.  Assuming a $5\\%$ sales tax is added  to the price of each shirt, what is the greatest possible price (in dollars) of a  shirt that would allow Alec to buy the shirts?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The price of all the shirts without sales tax and the entrance fee must be at most $(130-2)/1.05=121.91$ dollars. Since Alec must buy 14 shirts, and since $121.91/14\\approx8.71$, the most each shirt can cost is $\\boxed{8}$ dollars."
