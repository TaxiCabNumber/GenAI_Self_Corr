        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+12x=73$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nFirst, we want to get the equation into standard quadratic form.  Subtracting 73 from both sides, we get:\n\n$x^2 + 12x - 73 = 0$\n\nNow we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = 12$, and $c = -73$.  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{12^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -73}}{2 \\cdot 1}$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\dfrac{-12 \\pm 20}{2}$\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n$x_1 = \\dfrac{-12 + 20}{2} = 4$\n\n$x_2 = \\dfrac{-12 - 20}{2} = -16$\n\nThe positive solution is 4.  We can rewrite 4 as $\\sqrt{16} - 0$.  Therefore, $a + b = 16 + 0 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we add $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+12x+36=109 \\Rightarrow (x+6)^2=109$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+6=\\sqrt{109}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{109}-6$. Thus, $a=109$ and $b=6$, so $a+b=\\boxed{115}$."
