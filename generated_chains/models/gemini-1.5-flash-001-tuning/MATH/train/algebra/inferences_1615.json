        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $19$ and their difference is $5$. What is their product?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x+y=19$ and $x-y=5$. Adding these equations, we get $2x = 24$, so $x=12$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $12 + y = 19$, so $y=7$. Therefore, the product of the two numbers is $12 \\cdot 7 = 84$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$. The problem translates into a system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 19\\\\\nx-y &= 5.\n\\end{align*} Adding the equations, we obtain $x+y+x-y = 24$, which implies $2x = 24$. Therefore, $x = 12$. Subtracting the equations, we obtain $(x+y)-(x-y) = 14$, which implies $2y = 14$. Therefore, $y = 7$. Our desired product is $xy = 12\\cdot7 =\\boxed{84}$."
