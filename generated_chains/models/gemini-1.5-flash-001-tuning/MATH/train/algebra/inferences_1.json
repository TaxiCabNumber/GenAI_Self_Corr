        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",
        "inference": "Let the original number of rows be $r$ and the number of members in each row be $m$.  Then the total number of band members is $rm+2$.  After the director makes the changes, there are $r-2$ rows and $m+1$ members in each row.  Thus, the total number of band members is $(r-2)(m+1)$.  Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we have  \\[rm+2=(r-2)(m+1).\\]Expanding the right side, we get $rm+2=rm-2m+r-2$.  Simplifying, we get $2m-r=-4$.  Since the band has less than 100 members, $rm+2<100$, so $rm<98$.  We want to find the largest possible value of $rm+2$, so we want to maximize $rm$.  We can rewrite the equation $2m-r=-4$ as $r=2m+4$.  Substituting this into the inequality $rm<98$, we get $m(2m+4)<98$.  This simplifies to $2m^2+4m-98<0$, or $m^2+2m-49<0$.  Factoring, we get $(m+7)(m-7)<0$.  Since $m$ is a positive integer, the solution to this inequality is $1\\le m\\le 6$.  We want to maximize $rm+2$, so we want to maximize $m$.  Thus, the largest possible value of $m$ is 6.  Substituting this into the equation $r=2m+4$, we get $r=16$.  Therefore, the largest possible number of band members is $rm+2=16\\cdot 6+2=\\boxed{98}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{98}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\\boxed{98}$."
