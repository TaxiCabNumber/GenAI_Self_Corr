Each complete pack has exactly $x$ pieces of gum.

        "inference": "The error in the solution lies in assuming that the ratio of cherry gum pieces to grape gum pieces remains the same even after Chewbacca loses a pack of cherry gum and finds more grape gum. This is not necessarily true, as the number of loose pieces can change independently of the number of packs.\n\nHere's how to correct the solution:\n\nLet's analyze the situation after Chewbacca loses a pack of cherry gum and finds more grape gum. He has:\n\n* **Cherry gum:**  $c - 1$ packs and $20 - x(c - 1)$ loose pieces\n* **Grape gum:** $g + 5$ packs and $30 - x(g + 5)$ loose pieces\n\nThe problem states that the *total* number of cherry gum pieces is the same before and after these changes. This means:\n\n* **Before:** $20xc + 20 - xc = 19xc + 20$\n* **After:** $20(c - 1) + 20 - x(c - 1) = 19xc + 20 - 20x$\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get:\n$19xc + 20 = 19xc + 20 - 20x$\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n$20x = 0$ \n\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{0}$. \n",
