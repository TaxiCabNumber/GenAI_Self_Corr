        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nax+3 & \\text{ if }x>0, \\\\\nab & \\text{ if }x=0, \\\\\nbx+c & \\text{ if }x<0.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]If $f(2)=5$, $f(0)=5$, and $f(-2)=-10$, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative integers, then what is $a+b+c$?",
        "inference": "We are given that $f(2) = 5$, so $2a + 3 = 5$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = 1$.  We are also given that $f(0) = 5$, so $ab = 5$.  Since $a = 1$, we find $b = 5$.  Finally, we are given that $f(-2) = -10$, so $-2b + c = -10$.  Substituting $b = 5$, we find $-10 + c = -10$, so $c = 0$.  Therefore, $a + b + c = 1 + 5 + 0 = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $2>0$ we know that $f(2)=a(2)+3=5$. Solving for $a$, we get that $a=1$. With $x=0$, we get that $f(0)=ab=5$. We already know that $a=1$, so $b=5$. Because -2 is negative, we know that $f(-2)=b(-2)+c=(5)(-2)+c=-10$. This tells us that $c=0$, so our answer is $a+b+c=1+5+0=\\boxed{6}$."

        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that the function is linear.  The problem does not specify the type of function, so we cannot assume it is linear.  Therefore, the solution is incorrect.\n\n**We need more information about the function to solve for *a*, *b*, and *c*.** \n",
