        "inference": "Solution:  We begin by factoring out an $a^4$ from the right side and an $a^5$ from the left side of the given equation:\n\n $$a^4(a^3xy-ay-x)=a^4(b^4-1).$$  Dividing both sides by $a^4$, we get\n\n $$a^3xy-ay-x=b^4-1.$$  We can rewrite the left side as\n\n $$a^3xy-ay-x=ay(a^2x-1)-x=ay(a^2x-1)-(a^2x-1)+a^2x-1=(a^2x-1)(ay-1)+(a^2x-1).$$  Factoring out an $a^2x-1$, we have\n\n $$(a^2x-1)(ay-1)+(a^2x-1)=(a^2x-1)(ay-1+1)=(a^2x-1)(ay).$$  Thus, we have\n\n $$(a^2x-1)(ay)=b^4-1.$$  We can factor the right side as a difference of squares:\n\n $$(a^2x-1)(ay)=(b^2+1)(b^2-1).$$  We can factor the right side again:\n\n $$(a^2x-1)(ay)=(b^2+1)(b+1)(b-1).$$  Since the left side is a product of two terms, we can match the factors on the right side with these two terms.  We want to group $b+1$ and $b-1$ together, since they are the only two factors on the right side that differ by 2.
