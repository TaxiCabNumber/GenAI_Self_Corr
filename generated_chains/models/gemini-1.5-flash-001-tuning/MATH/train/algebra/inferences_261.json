        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$?",
        "inference": "The first circle is $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$, and the second circle is $(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 4$.  We see that the two circles are concentric, and the smaller circle is completely contained within the larger circle.  Thus, the circles intersect at no points, and the product of their coordinates is $\\boxed{0}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Add $(-2/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the first equation and $(-8/2)^2$ and $(-10/2)^2$ to the second equation to find that the given equations are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x^2-2x+1)+(y^2-10y+25)&=1\\text{, and} \\\\\n(x^2-8x+16)+(y^2-10y+25)&=4\n\\end{align*} which are equivalent to \\begin{align*}\n(x-1)^2+(y-5)^2 &=1^2, \\\\\n(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2 &=2^2,\n\\end{align*} respectively.  Hence, the two circles have centers $(1,5)$ and $(4,5)$ respectively and radii $1$ and $2$ respectively. Since the centers of the circles are $3$ units apart and the sum of their radii is $3$, the two circles intersect at only one point.  We can see that $(2,5)$ is the desired intersection point, so our product is $2 \\cdot 5 =\\boxed{10}$."
