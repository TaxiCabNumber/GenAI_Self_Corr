At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?",
        "inference": "First, we find the $x$-intercepts by setting $y=0$:\n$$\n0 = (x-3)^2(x+2).\n$$This equation holds if and only if $x-3=0$ or $x+2=0$. Therefore, the $x$-intercepts are at $x=3$ and $x=-2$. \n\nNext, we find the $y$-intercept by setting $x=0$:\n$$\ny = (-3)^2(2) = 18.\n$$Therefore, the $y$-intercept is at $y=18$. \n\nThe triangle formed by these intercepts is a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 18. \n\nThe area of a right triangle is half the product of its legs, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(18) = 45$ square units. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$.

        "inference": "The error is that the triangle formed by the intercepts is not a right triangle. Here's why:\n\n* The x-intercepts are at x = 3 and x = -2. \n* The y-intercept is at y = 18.\n\nThis means the base of the triangle is 5 units (from x = -2 to x = 3). The height of the triangle is 18 units (from the x-axis to the y-intercept).\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 5 * 18 = **45 square units**. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$.
