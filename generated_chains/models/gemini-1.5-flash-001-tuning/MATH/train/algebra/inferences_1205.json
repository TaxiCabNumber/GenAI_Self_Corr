        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical water tank is $\\frac{1}{5}$ full. If three liters were added, the tank would be $\\frac{1}{4}$ full. How many liters does the tank hold when it is full?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of liters of water in the tank originally be $w$, and let the number of liters of water the tank can hold when it is full be $c$. Originally, we have the equation $\\frac{w}{c}=\\frac{1}{5}$. Cross multiplying, we have $c = 5w$, or $w=\\frac{c}{5}$. After three liters of water are added, we have the equation $\\frac{w+3}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Cross multiplying, we have $c=4w+12$. Substituting the previous expression for $w$ into this last equation to eliminate $w$, we get $c=4(\\frac{c}{5})+12$, or $c=60$. Thus, the number of liters of water the tank can hold is $\\boxed{60}$."
