        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that $lw = 2l + 2w$.  We can rewrite this equation as $lw - 2l - 2w = 0$.  Adding 4 to both sides, we get $lw - 2l - 2w + 4 = 4$, which factors as $(l - 2)(w - 2) = 4$. Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, the only possible pairs $(l - 2, w - 2)$ are $(1,4)$, $(2,2)$, and $(4,1)$.  These correspond to rectangles with dimensions $3 \\times 6$, $4 \\times 4$, and $6 \\times 3$.  Since the rectangle is not a square, the perimeter is $2(3 + 6) = \\boxed{18}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$"
