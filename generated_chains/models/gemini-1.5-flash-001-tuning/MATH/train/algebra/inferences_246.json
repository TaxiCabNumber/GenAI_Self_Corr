        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBy starting with a million and alternatively dividing by 2 and multiplying by 5, Anisha created a sequence of integers that starts 1000000, 500000, 2500000, 1250000, and so on. What is the last integer in her sequence? Express your answer in the form $a^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $a$ is as small as possible.",
        "inference": "The sequence alternates between dividing by 2 and multiplying by 5.  This means that the sequence is equivalent to repeatedly multiplying by $\\frac{5}{2}$.  Since we started with 1000000, the $n$th term in the sequence is equal to $1000000\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{n-1}$. We want the largest term that is still an integer.  Since 1000000 is a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that divides $5^{n-1}$.\n\nSince 5 and 2 are relatively prime, the largest power of 2 that divides $5^{n-1}$ is 1, which occurs when $n = 1$. Therefore, the last integer in the sequence is $1000000 \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^{1-1} = 1000000 = 10^6$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10^6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Anisha begins with the integer $10^6=(2^6)(5^6)$.  After 12 steps, every factor of 2 is removed and replaced with a factor of $5$, so what remains is $5^6\\cdot 5^6=\\boxed{5^{12}}$."
