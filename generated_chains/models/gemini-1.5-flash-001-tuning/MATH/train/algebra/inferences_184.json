I hope it is correct.'\nA car travels the 120 miles from $A$ to $B$ at 60 miles per hour, and then returns to $A$ on the same road. If the average rate of the round trip is 45 miles per hour, what is the rate, in miles per hour, of the car traveling back from $B$ to $A$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the rate, in miles per hour, of the car traveling back from $B$ to $A$.  The time it takes to travel from $A$ to $B$ is $\\frac{120}{60} = 2$ hours.  The time it takes to travel from $B$ to $A$ is $\\frac{120}{x}$ hours.  The average rate of the round trip is equal to the total distance traveled divided by the total time traveled, so we have  \\[\\frac{120 + 120}{2 + \\frac{120}{x}} = 45.\\] Solving for $x$, we get  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{240}{2 + \\frac{120}{x}} &= 45 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 240 &= 90 + \\frac{5400}{x} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 150 &= \\frac{5400}{x} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= \\frac{5400}{150} = \\boxed{36}.\n\\end{align*} Final Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ denote the number of miles in the distance from $A$ to $B$ and let $r$ denote the speed of the car (in miles per hour) on the return trip.  It takes $d/60$ hours to travel from $A$ to $B$ and $d/r$ hours to travel from $B$ to $A$.  Round trip, $2d$ miles are covered in $d/60+d/r$ hours for an average speed of  \\[\n\\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{60}+\\frac{d}{r}} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{60}{d}}{\\frac{60}{d}} =\n\\frac{120}{1+\\frac{60}{r}}\n\\] Setting this expression equal to $45$, we find $r=\\boxed{36}$."
