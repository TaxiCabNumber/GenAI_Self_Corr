Since $f$ is invertible, this equation is satisfied only if $x^2=x^4$, so we simply count solutions to that equation. We can rearrange the equation $x^2=x^4$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n0 &= x^4-x^2 \\\\\n0 &= x^2(x^2-1) \\\\\n0 &= x^2(x+1)(x-1)\n\\end{align*}The last factorization shows that the solutions are $x=-1,0,1$. Therefore, the graphs of $y=f(x^2)$ and $y=f(x^4)$ must intersect at exactly $\\boxed{3}$ points."
