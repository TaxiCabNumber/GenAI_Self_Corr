At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 5$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$. What is the area of the square?",

        "ground_truth": "The points of intersection of the line $y = 5$ and $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ are found when $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 5$. Thus we have the quadratic  $x^2 + 3x -3=0$. By the quadratic formula,  $$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -3}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, which will give a side length of the square.
