Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$.

For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$. One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero.

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it doesn't consider both possible cases for the distance between the points:  $|y_1 - y_2| = 5$.  We need to consider both  $y_1 - y_2 = 5$ and $y_1 - y_2 = -5$. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe know that $y_1 = k^2 + 6k + 5$ and $y_2 = mk + b$.  Since the two points are 5 units apart, we have two possible cases:\n\n**Case 1:** $y_1 - y_2 = 5$\n\nThis gives us $k^2 + 6k + 5 - (mk + b) = 5$. Simplifying, we get $k^2 + (6-m)k - b = 0$.\n\n**Case 2:** $y_1 - y_2 = -5$\n\nThis gives us $k^2 + 6k + 5 - (mk + b) = -5$. Simplifying, we get $k^2 + (6-m)k - (b + 10) = 0$.\n\nSince the line $y = mx + b$ passes through (1, 6), we know that $6 = m + b$, which means $m = 6 - b$.\n\nNow we need to find the values of $b$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem.  We'll analyze each case separately:\n\n**Case 1:** \n\nSubstituting $m = 6 - b$ into our equation from Case 1, we get $k^2 + bk - b = 0$.  For this quadratic to have two distinct roots, its discriminant must be positive: $b^2 - 4(-b) > 0$.  This simplifies to $b^2 + 4b > 0$, which factors as $b(b+4) > 0$. This inequality holds when $b < -4$ or $b > 0$.\n\n**Case 2:**\n\nSubstituting $m = 6 - b$ into our equation from Case 2, we get $k^2 + bk - (b + 10) = 0$. The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4(-b-10) = b^2 + 4b + 40$.  Since the discriminant must be positive for two distinct roots, we have $b^2 + 4b + 40 > 0$. This quadratic has no real roots, so the inequality holds for all values of $b$.\n\nCombining the results of both cases, we see that the solution is $b < -4$ or $b > 0$. Since $m = 6 - b$, the possible values of $m$ are $m > 10$ or $m < 6$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $\\boxed{y = mx + b}$, where $m > 10$ or $m < 6$. \n",
