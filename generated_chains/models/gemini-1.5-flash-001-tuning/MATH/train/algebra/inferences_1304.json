At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $P(n)$ and $S(n)$ denote the product and the sum, respectively, of the digits of the integer $n$. For example, $P(23) = 6$ and $S(23) = 5$. Suppose $N$ is a two-digit number such that $N = P(N) +\nS(N)$. What is the units digit of $N$?",
        "inference": "Let $N = 10a + b,$ where $a$ and $b$ are digits.  Then $P(N) = ab$ and $S(N) = a + b,$ so\n\\[10a + b = ab + a + b.\\]This simplifies to $9a = ab,$ so $9 = b.$  Hence, the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{9}.$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose $N=10a+b$. Then $10a+b=ab+(a+b)$. It follows that $9a=ab$, which implies that $b=9$, since $a \\neq 0$. So the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
