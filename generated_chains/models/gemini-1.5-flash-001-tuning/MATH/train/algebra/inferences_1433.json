At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $c$ will the circle with equation $x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 4y + c = 0$ have a radius of length 4?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nWe can find the radius of a circle by completing the square.  First, rearrange the terms: \n\\[(x^2 + 6x) + (y^2 - 4y) = -c.\\]To complete the square in $x,$ we take half of the coefficient of $x,$ square it, and add it to both sides.  Half of 6 is 3, and 3 squared is 9.  To complete the square in $y,$ we take half of the coefficient of $y,$ square it, and add it to both sides.  Half of $-4$ is $-2,$ and $(-2)^2 = 4.$  This gives us\n\\[(x^2 + 6x + 9) + (y^2 - 4y + 4) = -c + 9 + 4.\\]We can now rewrite the left-hand side as\n\\[(x + 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = -c + 13.\\]The right-hand side is the square of the radius.  We want the radius to be 4, so we must have $-c + 13 = 4^2 = 16.$  Solving for $c,$ we find $c = \\boxed{-3}.$ \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x+3)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 13 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 4, we must have $13 - c = 4^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{-3}$."
