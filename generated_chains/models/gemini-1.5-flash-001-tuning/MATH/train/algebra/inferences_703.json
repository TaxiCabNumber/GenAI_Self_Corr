At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 50 and their difference is 6. What is their product?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x + y = 50$ and $x - y = 6$. Adding these two equations, we get $2x = 56$, so $x = 28$. Substituting this back into the first equation, we get $28 + y = 50$, so $y = 22$.  Therefore, the product of the two numbers is $28 \\cdot 22 = \\boxed{616}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{616}$.
