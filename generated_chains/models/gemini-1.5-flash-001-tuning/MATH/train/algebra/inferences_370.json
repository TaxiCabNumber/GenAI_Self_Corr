Set the equation of the perpendicular line equal to 0 and solve for $x$.\n\nFirst, we find the slope of the given line by rewriting it in slope-intercept form. Subtracting $3x$ from both sides, we get $-2y = -3x + 6$, so $y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 3$. Therefore, the slope of the given line is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line, which is $-\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nWe know that the $y$-intercept of the perpendicular line is 2. Using the slope-intercept form of a line, we can write the equation of the perpendicular line as $y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$.\n\nTo find the $x$-intercept, we set $y$ equal to 0 and solve for $x$.  We get $0 = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 2$, so $\\frac{2}{3}x = 2$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we get $x = 3$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.** \n",
        "ground_truth": "By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \\frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\\frac{2}{3} x + 2$.  We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \\boxed{3}$."
