At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the squares of two positive integers is 193. The product of the two integers is 84. What is the sum of the two integers?",

Substituting the given values, we have $(x+y)^2 = 193 + 2(84) = 361$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, $x+y$ is positive, so $x+y = \\sqrt{361} = 19$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$.
