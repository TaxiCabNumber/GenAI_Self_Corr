At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBoatsRUs built 7 canoes in January of this year and then each subsequent calendar month they built twice the number of canoes they had built the previous month. How many total canoes were built by BoatsRUs by the end of May of this year?",
