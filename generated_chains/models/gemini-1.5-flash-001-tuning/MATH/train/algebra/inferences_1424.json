At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 2007 AMC 10 will be scored by awarding $6$ points for each correct response, $0$ points for each incorrect response, and $1.5$ points for each problem left unanswered. After looking over the $25$ problems, Sarah has decided to attempt the first $22$ and leave only the last $3$ unanswered.\n\nHow many of the first $22$ problems must she solve correctly in order to score at least $100$ points?",
        "inference": "Solution: Sarah will earn $3 \\times 1.5 = 4.5$ points for the unanswered problems. So she needs to score at least $100 - 4.5 = 95.5$ points from the first 22 problems. Each correct answer is worth 6 points, so she needs to get $\\frac{95.5}{6} \\approx 15.92$ problems correct. Since she can't answer a fraction of a question, she needs to solve $\\boxed{16}$ problems correctly. Final Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
