        "inference": "The solution correctly identifies the repeating cycle of the function. However, the final step is incorrect. The question asks for the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $f(2) = f^a(2)$.  The solution found that the cycle repeats after 6 applications of the function, but it's not $a=6$.
