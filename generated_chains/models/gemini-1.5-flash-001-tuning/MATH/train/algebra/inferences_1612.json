        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular room has a perimeter of 42 feet and an area of 108 square feet. What is the length, in feet, of the shorter side?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the shorter side be $x$ feet and the length of the longer side be $y$ feet. We are given that the perimeter is 42 feet, so $2x + 2y = 42$. We are also given that the area is 108 square feet, so $xy = 108$.  We can simplify the perimeter equation to $x+y=21$.  Solving for $y$ gives $y=21-x$.  Substituting this into the area equation gives $x(21-x)=108$.  Expanding the left side gives $21x-x^2=108$.  Rearranging the terms gives $x^2-21x+108=0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(x-12)(x-9)=0$.  Therefore, $x=12$ or $x=9$.  Since we are looking for the shorter side, the final answer is $\\boxed{9}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the longer side have length $a$ and the shorter side have length $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+2b&=42\\\\\nab&=108\n\\end{align*} From Equation (1), we have $a+b=21$, so $a=21-b$. Substituting that into Equation (2) to eliminate $a$, we get \\begin{align*}\n(21-b)(b)&=108\\\\\n21b-b^2&=108\\\\\nb^2-21b+108&=0\n\\end{align*} Factoring the equation, we get $(b-9)(b-12)=0$, so $b=9$ or $b=12$. $b=12$ corresponds to the longer side, so the length of the shorter side is $\\boxed{9}$ feet."
