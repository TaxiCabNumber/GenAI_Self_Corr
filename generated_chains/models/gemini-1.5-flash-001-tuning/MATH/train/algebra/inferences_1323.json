        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the first and third of three consecutive integers is 118. What is the value of the second integer?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$.  We are given that $x + (x+2) = 118$.  Combining like terms, we have $2x+2 = 118$.  Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us $2x = 116$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $x = 58$.  Therefore, the second integer is $x+1 = 58+1 = \\boxed{59}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{59}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the second integer, then the first integer is $n-1$ and the third integer is $n+1$.  The sum of the first and third integers is $2n$, so $n=118/2=\\boxed{59}$."
