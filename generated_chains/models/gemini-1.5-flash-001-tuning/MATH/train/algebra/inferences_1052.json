        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA math field day competition is held in a room with many tables, and there are 6 stools at each table. Each stool has 3 legs, and each table has 4 legs. If there is a total of 484 legs on all the tables and stools in the room, how many tables are in the room?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of tables. Then the number of stools is $6x$.  Each stool has 3 legs, so there are $3\\cdot 6x = 18x$ stool legs.  Each table has 4 legs, so there are $4x$ table legs.  The total number of legs is $18x + 4x = 484$.  Combining like terms, we have $22x = 484$.  Dividing both sides by 22, we get $x = 22$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the number of stools in the room and $t$ be the number of tables. We are looking for the value of $t$. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= 6t \\\\\n3s + 4t &= 484 \\\\\n\\end{align*}To solve for $t$, we need to eliminate $s$ from the equations above. Substitute the first equation into the second to eliminate $s$, to get $3(6t)+4t=484$, or $t=22$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{22}$ tables in the room."
