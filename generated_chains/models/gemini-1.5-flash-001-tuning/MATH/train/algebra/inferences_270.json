At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integer values of $x$ is $x^2 < 7x$?",

If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$."
