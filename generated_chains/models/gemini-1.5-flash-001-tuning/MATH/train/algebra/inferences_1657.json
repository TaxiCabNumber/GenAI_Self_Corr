Since both $b$ and 2008 are positive, it is clear that $r$ and $s$ must also be positive.  By multiplying out the right-hand side as shown, we see that we must have $rs=2008$, which has prime factorization $2008=2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 251$.  Recall that we are trying to minimize $b=r+s$.  The best we can do is to let $r=251$ and $s=8$, leading to $b=251+8=\\boxed{259}$."
