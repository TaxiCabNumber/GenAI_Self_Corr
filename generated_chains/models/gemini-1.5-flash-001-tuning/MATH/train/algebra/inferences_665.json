At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many zeros are in the expansion of $999,\\!999,\\!999,\\!998^2$?",

        "ground_truth": "We note that $999,999,999,998=10^{12}-2$, so $999,999,999,998^2=(10^{12}-2)^2=10^{24}-4\\cdot10^{12}+4$. Consider this last expression one term at a time. The first term, $10^{24}$, creates a number with 24 zeros and a one at the front. The second term, $4\\cdot10^{12}$, is a number with 12 zeros and a four at the front. The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 11 nines, then a six, then 12 zeros. Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a four. Thus, we are left with $\\boxed{11}$ zeros."
