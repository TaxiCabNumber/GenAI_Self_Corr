At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x)$ is a function defined only for $0 \\le x \\le 1$, and $f(x) = ax+b$ for constants $a$ and $b$ where $a < 0$, then what is the range of $f$ in terms of $a$ and $b$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "The graph of $f(x)$ is a line segment with slope $a < 0$, so the function is decreasing.  Therefore, the maximum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = 0$, and the minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = 1$.\n\nThe maximum value of $f(x)$ is $f(0) = b$, and the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $f(1) = a+b$.  Since $a < 0$, $a+b < b$.  Thus, the range of $f$ is $\\boxed{[a+b,b]}$.",
        "ground_truth": "The function $f(x) = ax + b$ is linear, so as $x$ varies over the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$, $f(x) = ax + b$ takes on all values between $b$ and $a + b$ (inclusive).  Furthermore, $a < 0$, so $a + b < b$.  Hence, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[a +b, b]}$."
