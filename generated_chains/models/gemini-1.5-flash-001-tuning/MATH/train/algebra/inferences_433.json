At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA point $(x,y)$ is a distance of 12 units from the $x$-axis. It is a distance of 10 units from the point $(1,6)$. It is a distance $n$ from the origin.

Next, we know that $y=12$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10 \\\\\nx^2-2x+1+36&=100 \\\\\nx^2-2x-63&=0 \\\\\n(x-9)(x+7)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x-9=0$ or $x+7=0$, so $x=9$ or $x=-7$. $x=9$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(9,12)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{9^2+12^2}=15$ units from the origin. $n=\\boxed{15}$."
