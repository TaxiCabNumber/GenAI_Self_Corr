        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat number can be added to both the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{3}{5}$ so that the resulting fraction will be equivalent to $\\frac{5}{6}$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number added to both the numerator and denominator.  We have the equation \\[\\frac{3+x}{5+x}=\\frac{5}{6}.\\]Cross-multiplying gives $6(3+x)=5(5+x)$. Expanding, we have $18+6x=25+5x$. Subtracting $5x$ from both sides gives $18+x=25$. Subtracting $18$ from both sides gives $x=7$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We seek the number $n$ such that $\\frac{3+n}{5+n} = \\frac{5}{6}$.  Multiplying both sides by $5+n$ and by 6 gives $(3+n)(6) = 5(5+n)$.  Expanding both sides gives $18 + 6n = 25 + 5n$.  Simplifying this equation gives $n = \\boxed{7}$."
