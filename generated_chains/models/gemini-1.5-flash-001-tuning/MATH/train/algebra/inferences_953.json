At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoann ate a total of 100 lollipops in five days. Each day after the first day she ate six more than she had eaten on the previous day. How many lollipops did she eat on the third day?",
        "inference": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n* **Let 'x' be the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day.**\n* **On the second day, she ate x + 6 lollipops.**\n* **On the third day, she ate (x + 6) + 6 = x + 12 lollipops.**\n* **On the fourth day, she ate (x + 12) + 6 = x + 18 lollipops.**\n* **On the fifth day, she ate (x + 18) + 6 = x + 24 lollipops.**\n* **The total number of lollipops she ate is x + (x + 6) + (x + 12) + (x + 18) + (x + 24) = 100**\n* **Simplifying the equation: 5x + 60 = 100**\n* **Solving for x: 5x = 40**\n* **Therefore, x = 8**\n* **So, on the third day, she ate x + 12 = 8 + 12 = 20 lollipops.**\n\n**Final Answer:  \\\\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.** \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of lollipops Joann ate on the first day be $a-12$, so she ate $a-6$ lollipops on the second day, $a$ on the third, and so on, eating $(a-12)+(5-1)\\cdot 6=a+12$ lollipops on the last day. The total number of lollipops is $5a$, which we are told is 100. Thus, $5a=100$ and $a=20$. Since $a$ is the number of lollipops Joann ate on the third day, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$ lollipops."
