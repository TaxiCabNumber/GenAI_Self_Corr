At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA student accidentally added five to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, changing the fraction's value to $\\frac12$. If the original numerator was a 2, what was the original denominator?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the original denominator.  The original fraction is $\\frac{2}{x}$.  Adding 5 to both the numerator and denominator gives us $\\frac{2+5}{x+5}=\\frac{7}{x+5}$.  We are told that this new fraction is equal to $\\frac12$.  Thus, we have the equation $\\frac{7}{x+5}=\\frac12$.  Cross-multiplying gives us $14=x+5$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the original denominator.  After adding 5 to both numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes $\\frac{7}{d+5}$.  If a fraction with 7 in the numerator is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}$, then the denominator is 14.  Solving $d+5=14$, we find $d=\\boxed{9}$."
