        "inference": "The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The first odd integer greater than 300 is 301, and the last odd integer less than 500 is 499.  The average of these two numbers is $\\frac{301+499}{2}=400$.  The number of odd integers between 300 and 500 is the same as the number of integers between 150 and 250, which is 100.  Therefore, the sum of all the odd integers between 300 and 500 is $400\\cdot100=\\boxed{40,\\!000}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40,\\!000}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We want to find the sum of the arithmetic series $301 + 303 + \\dots + 499$.\n\nThe common difference is 2, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this arithmetic sequence is $301 + 2(n - 1) = 2n + 299$.  If $2n + 299 = 499$, then $n = 100$, so the number of terms in this sequence is 100.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(301 + 499)/2 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{40000}$."
