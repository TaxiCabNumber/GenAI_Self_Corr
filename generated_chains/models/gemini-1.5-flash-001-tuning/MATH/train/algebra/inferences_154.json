        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent basketball game, Shenille attempted only three-point shots and two-point shots.  She was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots and $30\\%$ of her two-point shots.  Shenille attempted $30$ shots.  How many points did she score?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of three-point shots Shenille attempted.  Then she attempted $30-x$ two-point shots.  She scored $0.2x$ three-point shots, for a total of $0.6x$ points.  She scored $0.3(30-x)$ two-point shots, for a total of $9-0.3x$ points.  Thus, Shenille scored $0.6x + 9 - 0.3x = 9 + 0.3x$ points.  We don't know $x$, so we can't calculate exactly how many points she scored.  We can only say that she scored between $9$ and $18$ points.  To see this, note that if she attempted all 30 shots as three-pointers, she would score at most $0.2\\cdot 30 \\cdot 3 = 18$ points, and if she attempted all 30 shots as two-pointers, she would score at least $0.3 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 2 = 18$ points.\n\nFinal Answer:  \\\\boxed{9 \\le \\text{points scored} \\le 18}.  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$.  We know that $x+y=30$.   We need to evaluate $(0.2\\cdot3)x +(0.3\\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\\%$ of them.\n\nSimplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$.  Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \\boxed{18}$."
