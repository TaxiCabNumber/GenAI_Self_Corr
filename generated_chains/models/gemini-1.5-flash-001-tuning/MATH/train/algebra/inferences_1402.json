        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\nThe problem starts with the distance formula, correctly setting up the expression for the distance between two points. It then sets this distance equal to $2\\sqrt{10}$ and solves for the unknown 'a'. \n\nThe steps involved in simplifying the equation and solving for 'a' are all valid. The final answer, the product of the two possible values of 'a', is indeed **-3**. \n\n**Therefore, the solution is correct.** \n",
