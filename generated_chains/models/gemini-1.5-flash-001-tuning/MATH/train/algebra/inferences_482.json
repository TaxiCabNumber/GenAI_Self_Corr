At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box with a volume of 16 $\\text{cm}^3$ can hold 50 paperclips. How many paperclips could a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ hold?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{150}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of paperclips that a box with a volume of 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ could hold. Setting up the ratio $\\frac{50}{16}=\\frac{x}{48}$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=150$.  Hence, a 48 $\\text{cm}^3$ box could hold $\\boxed{150}$ paperclips.  We also could have noted that tripling the size of the box triples the number of paperclips we can hold, so the new box can hold $50\\cdot 3 = 150$ paperclips."
