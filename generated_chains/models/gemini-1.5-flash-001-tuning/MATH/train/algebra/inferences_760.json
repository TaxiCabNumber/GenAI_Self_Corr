At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe side of a square has the length $(x-2)$, while a rectangle has a length of $(x-3)$ and a width of $(x+4)$. If the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the square, what is the sum of the possible values of $x$?",
