At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get\n\\[9y - 9x = 7.\\]Then $y - x = \\frac{7}{9}$, so\n\\[\\frac{0.\\overline{666}}{1.\\overline{333}} = \\frac{x}{y} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{9}}.\\]Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{9}}$.

Multiplying by 10, and subtracting $x$, you get 9x = 6, and thus, $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.  We then notice that the denominator is $1 + \\frac{x}{2}$, thereby giving us a value of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ for the entire fraction."
