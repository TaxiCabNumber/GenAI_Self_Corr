        "ground_truth": "Setting the expressions for $g(x)$ equal to each other, we get $5x-4=f^{-1}(x)-3$, so $f^{-1}(x)=5x-1$.  If we substitute $f(x)$ into this equation for $x$, we get  \\[f^{-1}(f(x))=5f(x)-1.\\]Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$, we have $x = 5f(x) - 1$.  Solving for $f(x)$, we find \\[f(x) = \\frac{x + 1}{5}.\\]Thus, $a=\\frac{1}{5}$ and $b=\\frac{1}{5}$, so $5a+5b=\\boxed{2}$."
