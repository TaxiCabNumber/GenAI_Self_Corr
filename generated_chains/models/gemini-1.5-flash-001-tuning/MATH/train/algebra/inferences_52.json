        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $45$. Their difference is $3$. What is the lesser of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number. We are given that $x+y = 45$ and $x-y = 3$. Adding these equations, we get $2x = 48$, so $x = 24$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $24+y = 45$, so $y = 21$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$. Thus: $y=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\\boxed{21}$."
