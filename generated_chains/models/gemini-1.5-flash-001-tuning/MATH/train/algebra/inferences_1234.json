        "inference": "Solution: For the quadratic to be factored, the product of the roots must be 72/3 = 24, and the sum of the roots must be -n/3. We must find the largest possible value of n, which corresponds to the smallest possible sum of the roots. The smallest possible sum of two integers whose product is 24 occurs when the two integers are as close together as possible, which is 4 and 6. The sum of these integers is 10, so n = -30.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{-30}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "When we factor $3x^2 + nx + 72$, our two factors are of the form $(3x + A)(x+B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are integers.  We must have $AB = 72$, and we want $3B +A$ to be as large as possible (because $3B+A$ is the coefficient of $x$ when $(3x+A)(x+B)$ is expanded). We make $3B + A$ as large as possible by letting $B=72$ and $A=1$; any other possibility reduces $3B$ much more than $A$ increases.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $n$ is $3B+A = 3(72) +1 =\\boxed{217}$."
