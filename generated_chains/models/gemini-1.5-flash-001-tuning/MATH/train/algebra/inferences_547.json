At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the equation $y=\\frac{x-1}{x^2+6x-7}$ have?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes $\\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x+7)}$. So the denominator equals $0$ when $x=1$ and $x=-7$. However, since the term $x-1$ also exists in the numerator and is of the same degree as in the denominator, $x=1$ is not a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the equation has only $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote at $x=-7$."
