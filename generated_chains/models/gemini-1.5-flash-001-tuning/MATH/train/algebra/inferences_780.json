        "inference": "The solution provided is incorrect because it makes an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the change in $x$ and $y$ values. \n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\nSince $f(a) = b$ and $f^{-1}(b) = a$, we know that the point $(a,b)$ lies on the graph of both $y=f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$. \n\nSimilarly, since $f(b) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(4) = b$, we know that the point $(b,4)$ lies on both graphs.\n\nTherefore, we have two points on the graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$: $(b,a)$ and $(4,b)$. \n\nThe slope of the line passing through these two points is $\\frac{a-b}{b-4}$.  Since the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y= f^{-1}(x)$ are reflections across the line $y=x$, the slope of the line passing through the points $(a,b)$ and $(b,4)$ on the graph of $y=f(x)$ is the reciprocal of this slope: $\\frac{b-4}{a-b}$.\n\nFrom the graph, we see that the slope of the line passing through $(a,b)$ and $(b,4)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\frac{b-4}{a-b} = \\frac{1}{2}$.  \n\nSince $f(b) = 4$, we see from the graph that $b = 2$.  Substituting this into the equation $\\frac{b-4}{a-b} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $\\frac{-2}{a-2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which gives us $a - 2 = -4$.  Therefore, $a - b = -4 - 2 = \\boxed{-6}$. \n",
