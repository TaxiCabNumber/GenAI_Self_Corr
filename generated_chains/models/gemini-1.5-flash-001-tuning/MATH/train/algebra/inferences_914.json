At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many four-digit numbers $N$ have the property that the three-digit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is one ninth of $N$?",
        "inference": "Let the four-digit number be $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are digits.  Then the three-digit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is $100b + 10c + d$.  We are given that\n\\[100b + 10c + d = \\frac{1}{9} (1000a + 100b + 10c + d).\\]This simplifies to $900b + 90c + 9d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, or $800b + 80c + 8d = 1000a$.  Dividing both sides by 8, we get $100b + 10c + d = 125a$.  Since $a$ is a digit, $125a$ must be a three-digit number, so $a$ must be 1.  Then $100b + 10c + d = 125$, so $b = 1$, $c = 2$, and $d = 5$.  Therefore, the only such number is 1125.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1125}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the leftmost digit of $N$ and let $x$ denote the three-digit number obtained by removing $a$. Then $N=1000a+x=9x$ and it follows that $1000a=8x$. Dividing both sides by 8 yields $125a=x$. All the values of $a$ in the range 1 to 7 result in three-digit numbers, hence there are $\\boxed{7}$ values for $N$."
