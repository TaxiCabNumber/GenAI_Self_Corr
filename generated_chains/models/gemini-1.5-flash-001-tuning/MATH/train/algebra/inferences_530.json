        "inference": "You are correct! There is an error in the solution. The error lies in assuming that the only solution to $x^y = 8$ is $(x,y) = (2,3)$. \n\n**Here's why and the correct solution:**\n\nThe equation $x^y = 8$ has other solutions, such as  $(x,y) = (8,1)$.  \n\nTo find all solutions, we need to consider all possible factorizations of 8:\n\n* **8 = 2^3:** This gives us the solution (2, 3)\n* **8 = 8^1:** This gives us the solution (8, 1)\n\n**Therefore, the correct solutions are (2, 3) and (8, 1).**\n\n**Final Answer:  \\\\boxed{(2,3), (8,1)}** \n",
