At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -6t^2 - 10t + 56$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 10 feet per second from a height of 56 feet from the surface from Mars. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "The ball hits the ground when $y = 0$. So, we need to solve the quadratic equation $-6t^2 - 10t + 56 = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula: \n$$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$\nwhere $a=-6$, $b=-10$, and $c=56$. Plugging in, we have:\n$$t = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{(-10)^2 - 4(-6)(56)}}{2(-6)}$$\n$$t = \\frac{10 \\pm \\sqrt{1444}}{-12}$$\n$$t = \\frac{10 \\pm 38}{-12}$$\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions: $t = -4$ and $t = \\frac{7}{3}$. Since time cannot be negative, the ball hits the ground after $\\frac{7}{3}$ seconds, or approximately $2.33$ seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.33}$  I hope it is correct. \n",
