At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=2x^2-10x-10$ and $y=x^2-4x+6$. Find all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
        "inference": "To find the points of intersection, we set the $y$-values equal to each other:\n\n$$2x^2 - 10x - 10 = x^2 - 4x + 6.$$Combining like terms, we get\n\n$$x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0.$$Factoring, we obtain\n\n$$(x - 8)(x + 2) = 0.$$Hence, $x = 8$ or $x = -2$.  To find the corresponding $y$-values, we can substitute these values of $x$ into either of the original equations.  Substituting $x = 8$ into $y = x^2 - 4x + 6,$ we find $y = 30.$  Substituting $x = -2$ into $y = x^2 - 4x + 6,$ we find $y = 18.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-2,18);(8,30)}.$ I hope it is correct.",

To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2=9$ to both sides, giving $(x-3)^2=16+9=25$.\n\nSo we have $x-3=\\pm5$. Solving for $x$ gives us $x=-2$ or $8$. Using these in our original parabolas, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-2,18)}$ and $\\boxed{(8,38)}$."
