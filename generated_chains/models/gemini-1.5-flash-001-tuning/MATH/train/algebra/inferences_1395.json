        "inference": "The solution is incorrect because it doesn't address the constraint on the variables. The problem requires $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ to be **positive** integers. \n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\n1. **Simplify the equation:**  Start by multiplying both sides by $6x$ to get rid of the fractions:\n   \n   ```\n   5x^2 + 6x = 18\n   ```\n\n2. **Rearrange the equation:** Move all terms to one side:\n\n   ```\n   5x^2 + 6x - 18 = 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Factor the quadratic:** The quadratic factors as:\n\n   ```\n   (5x - 6)(x + 3) = 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Solve for x:** This gives us two possible solutions:\n\n   ```\n   x = 6/5  or  x = -3 \n   ```\n\n5. **Consider the constraint:** Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ must be positive integers, the solution $x = 6/5$ is the only valid one.\n\n6. **Find a, b, c, and d:** Now, substitute $x = 6/5$ back into the original equation and solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:\n\n   ```\n   (a/b) * (6/5) + (c/d) = 3\n   ```\n\n   Since we want positive integers, we can choose:\n\n   * $a = 6$\n   * $b = 1$\n   * $c = 5$\n   * $d = 5$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$. \n",
