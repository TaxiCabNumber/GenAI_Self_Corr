At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

We factor the denominator to get  \\[(x^2 + 2x - 3)(x - 3) = (x + 3)(x - 1)(x - 3).\\]The denominator is zero when $x = -3$, $x = 1$, or $x = 3$.  However, the expression is also undefined when $x = 3$ because the numerator is also zero in this case, resulting in a division by zero.  Therefore, the expression is undefined for $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$. This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined."
