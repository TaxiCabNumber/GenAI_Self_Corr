        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJames is six years older than Louise. Eight years from now, James will be four times as old as Louise was four years before now. What is the sum of their current ages?",
        "inference": "Let James's current age be $J$ and Louise's current age be $L$. \n\nWe know that James is six years older than Louise, so: \n$J = L + 6$\n\nWe also know that eight years from now, James will be four times as old as Louise was four years ago. This translates to:\n$J + 8 = 4(L - 4)$\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for $L$:\n\n$(L + 6) + 8 = 4(L - 4)$\n$L + 14 = 4L - 16$\n$30 = 3L$\n$L = 10$\n\nNow we can plug $L = 10$ back into the first equation to find $J$:\n\n$J = 10 + 6$\n$J = 16$\n\nTherefore, James is currently 16 years old and Louise is currently 10 years old. The sum of their current ages is $16 + 10 = 26$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $J$ represent James's current age and $L$ represent Louise's current age. Since James is six years older than Louise, we get $J=L+6$. We're also told in words that $J+8=4(L-4)$. We can substitute for $J$ in terms of $L$ into the second equation to get \\[(L+6)+8=4(L-4).\\] Expanding both products gives \\[ L+14=4L-16.\\] Adding 16 to both sides and subtracting 14 from both sides gives  $30=3L$, so $l=10$. So Louise is currently 10 years old, which means James is currently $10+6=16$ years old. The sum of their current ages is $10+16=\\boxed{26}$ years."
