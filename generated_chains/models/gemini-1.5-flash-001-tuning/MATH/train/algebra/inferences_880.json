At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTopsoil costs $\\$6$ per cubic foot. What is the cost, in dollars, of 5 cubic yards of topsoil?",

        "ground_truth": "Cubing both sides of the equation $1\\text{ yd.}=3\\text{ ft.}$, we find that $1\\text{ yd.}^3=27\\text{ ft.}^3$.  Therefore, there are $27\\cdot5$ cubic feet in 5 cubic yards.  Multiplying the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot, we find that the total cost is $27\\cdot5\\cdot6=27\\cdot30=\\boxed{810}$ dollars."
