        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHomewood Middle School has 1200 students, and 730 of these students attend a summer picnic. If two-thirds of the girls in the school and one-half of the boys in the school attend the picnic, how many girls attend the picnic?  (Assume that each student in the school is either a boy or a girl.)",
        "inference": "Let $g$ be the number of girls in the school and $b$ be the number of boys in the school. We know that $g + b = 1200$. We also know that $\\frac{2}{3}g + \\frac{1}{2}b = 730$. \n\nTo solve for $g$, we can use substitution. Solving the first equation for $b$, we get $b = 1200 - g$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3}g + \\frac{1}{2}(1200 - g) = 730$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3}g + 600 - \\frac{1}{2}g = 730$\n\n$\\frac{1}{6}g = 130$\n\n$g = 130 \\cdot 6 = 780$\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{780}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of girls at HMS be $g$ and the number of boys be $b$. Thus, the total number of students implies $g + b = 1200$ and the attendance figures imply $\\frac{2}{3} g + \\frac{1}{2} b = 730$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting that from the second equation multiplied by 6, we get $g = 780$. And, the number of girls who attended the picnic is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 780 = \\boxed{520}$."
