        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJanice bought 30 items each priced at 30 cents, 2 dollars, or 3 dollars. If her total purchase price was $\\$$30.00, how many 30-cent items did she purchase?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of 30-cent items, $y$ be the number of \\$2 items, and $z$ be the number of \\$3 items. We have the following system of equations: \n\\begin{align*}\nx+y+z &= 30 \\\\\n0.3x+2y+3z &= 30 \n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying the first equation by $-3$ and adding it to the second equation gives \n\\[-2.7x-y = -60.\\] Multiplying this equation by $-1$ gives $2.7x+y=60$.  Then $x = \\frac{60-y}{2.7}$. Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ must all be integers, $\\frac{60-y}{2.7}$ must be an integer. This means $60-y$ must be a multiple of 2.7. The only multiple of 2.7 less than 60 is 54, so $y=6$, which means $x = \\frac{60-6}{2.7} = \\boxed{20}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a,b,c$ be the number of 30 cent items, 2 dollar items, and 3 dollar items that Janice bought, respectively. Since there are 30 items in all, $a+b+c = 30$. The total cost is 3000 cents, so $30a+200b+300c = 3000$, which can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\n30a+(30b+170b)+(30c+270c) &= 3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 30(a+b+c) + 170b+270c &= 3000.\n\\end{align*}  Substituting $a+b+c = 30$ gives \\begin{align*}\n30\\cdot30 + 170b+270c &=3000\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 170b+270c &= 2100\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 17b+27c &= 210.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $17b+27c$ is a multiple of 10. Since $17b+27c = 10(b+2c) + 7(b+c)$, $7(b+c)$ is also a multiple of 10. 10 cannot divide 7, so 10 divides $b+c$. Janice bought 30 items, so the reasonable values of $b+c$ are $0, 10, 20, 30$. If $b+c = 0$, then $17b+27c = 0$, which isn't true. If $b+c=20$, then the least possible value of $17b+27c$ is $17\\cdot20 = 340$, which is also impossible. By the same reasoning $b+c=30$ is also impossible. We conclude that $b+c= 10$, namely that $b=6$ and $c=4$ to satisfy $17b+27c = 210$. Thus $a = 30-(b+c) = \\boxed{20}$."
