At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the line $x+y=b$ is a perpendicular bisector of the line segment from $(0,3)$ to $(6,9)$. What is the value of b?",
        "inference": "The midpoint of the segment from $(0,3)$ to $(6,9)$ is $\\left(\\frac{0+6}{2},\\frac{3+9}{2}\\right)=(3,6)$.  The slope of this segment is $\\frac{9-3}{6-0}=1$.  Since the line $x+y=b$ is perpendicular to this segment, its slope is $-1$.  Thus, the equation of the line $x+y=b$ can be written as $y=-x+b$.  Substituting $(3,6)$ into this equation, we get $6=-3+b$, so $b=\\boxed{9}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the line $x+y=b$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment from $(0,3)$ to $(6,9)$, it must pass through the midpoint of this segment.  The midpoint is: $$\\left(\\frac{0+6}{2},\\frac{3+9}{2}\\right)=(3,6)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+6=b\\Rightarrow b=\\boxed{9}$."
