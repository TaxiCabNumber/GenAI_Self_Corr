        "inference": "The solution provided only uses two terms of the arithmetic sequence to calculate the common difference, and it doesn't use the information that we are looking for the 7th term. We need to use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n* $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$\n\nWhere:\n* $a_n$ is the nth term\n* $a_1$ is the first term\n* $d$ is the common difference\n\nWe know that the 4th term is 17 and the 6th term is 39.  We can set up a system of equations:\n\n* $17 = a_1 + 3d$\n* $39 = a_1 + 5d$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n* $22 = 2d$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get:\n\n* $d = 11$\n\nNow, we can substitute $d=11$ into either of the original equations to solve for $a_1$.  Let's use the first equation:\n\n* $17 = a_1 + 3(11)$\n* $17 = a_1 + 33$\n* $a_1 = -16$\n\nFinally, we can find the 7th term using the formula:\n\n* $a_7 = -16 + (7-1)(11)$\n* $a_7 = -16 + 66$\n* $a_7 = 50$\n\nTherefore, the 7th term of the arithmetic sequence is $\\boxed{50}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
