        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are given that $2l+2w=24$, which simplifies to $l+w=12$.  We want to maximize the area, which is given by $A=lw$. Solving the equation $l+w=12$ for $l$, we get $l=12-w$. Substituting this into the area equation, we get $A=(12-w)w=12w-w^2$. This is a quadratic equation, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards. The maximum value of the parabola occurs at its vertex. The $w$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=-1$ and $b=12$. So, the $w$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{12}{2(-1)}=6$. When $w=6$, we have $l=12-6=6$. Therefore, the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square with side length 6 inches. The maximum area is $6\\cdot6=\\boxed{36}$ square inches. Final Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches."
