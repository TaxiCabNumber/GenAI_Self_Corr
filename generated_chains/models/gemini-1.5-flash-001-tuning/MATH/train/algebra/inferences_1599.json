At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Setting this equal to $3d$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n9d^2&=(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2\\\\\n9d^2&=45+d^2+6d+9\\\\\n8d^2-6d-54&=0\\\\\n4d^2-3d-27&=0\\\\\n(4d+9)(d-3)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $d$ are $-\\frac{9}{4}$ and $3$. We find that $-\\frac{9}{4}$ is an extraneous answer (since distance cannot be negative), so our answer is $d=\\boxed{3}$."
