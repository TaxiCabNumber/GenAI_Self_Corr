The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is \\[\\frac{n + (n + 17)}{2} \\cdot 18 = 9(2n + 17).\\]Since 9 is a perfect square, $2n+17$ must also be a perfect square. The smallest value of $n$ for which this occurs is  $n = 4$, so  $9(2n+17) = 9\\cdot 25 = \\boxed{225}$."
