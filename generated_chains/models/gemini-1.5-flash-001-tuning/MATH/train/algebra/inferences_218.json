At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the following properties: (1) The maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$. (2) The graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$. If the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, then what is the value of $m$?",
        "inference": "Since the maximum value occurs at $x = 3$, the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  We can use this information to write the equation of the parabola in vertex form:\n\n$$y = a(x-3)^2 + 5.$$Since the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$, we can substitute $x = 0$ and $y = -13$ into the equation:\n\n$$-13 = a(0-3)^2 + 5.$$Solving for $a$, we find $a = -2$.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola is\n\n$$y = -2(x-3)^2 + 5.$$Substituting $x = 4$, we find $y = -2(4-3)^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
