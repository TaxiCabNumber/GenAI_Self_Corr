At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf eight apples cost the same as four bananas, and two bananas cost the same as three cucumbers, how many cucumbers can Tyler buy for the price of 16 apples?",
