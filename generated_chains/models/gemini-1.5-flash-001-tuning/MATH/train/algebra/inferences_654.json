At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of three consecutive even integers if the sum of the first and third integers is $128$?",
        "inference": "Let the first even integer be $x$.  Then the next two consecutive even integers are $x + 2$ and $x + 4$.  We are given that $x + (x + 4) = 128$, so $2x + 4 = 128$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = 62$.  Therefore, the three consecutive even integers are 62, 64, and 66, and their sum is $62 + 64 + 66 = \\boxed{192}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{192}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of an arithmetic sequence equals the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the average of the first and last term is $\\frac{a_1+a_3}{2}=\\frac{128}{2}=64$ and the number of terms is 3. We multiply to get $64\\cdot3=\\boxed{192}$."
