        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the areas of two squares is $\\frac{192}{80}$. After rationalizing the denominator, the ratio of their side lengths can be expressed in the simplified form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. What is the value of the sum $a+b+c$?",

        "ground_truth": "We start off by simplifying the ratio $\\frac{192}{80}$ to $\\frac{12}{5}$. The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of sidelengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{12}{5}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$So, our answer is $2+15+5=\\boxed{22}$. If you started off by taking the square root of $\\frac{192}{80}$ directly without simplifying it first, you still get the same answer. $$\\sqrt{\\frac{192}{80}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{192}}{\\sqrt{80}}=\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$"
