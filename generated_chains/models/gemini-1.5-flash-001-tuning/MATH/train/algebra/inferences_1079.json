        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour pens and three pencils cost $\\$2.24$. Two pens and five pencils cost $\\$1.54$. No prices include tax. In cents, what is the cost of a pencil?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the cost of a pen in cents and $y$ be the cost of a pencil in cents.  We can set up a system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224 \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154.\n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying the second equation by $-2$, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224 \\\\\n-4x - 10y &= -308.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding the two equations, we get $-7y = -84$.  Dividing both sides by $-7$, we find $y = 12$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the price of a pen be $x$ and the price of a pencil be $y$, in cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n4x + 3y &= 224, \\\\\n2x + 5y &= 154. \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can subtract the first equation from twice the second equation to obtain $7y = 84$, so $y = 12$.
