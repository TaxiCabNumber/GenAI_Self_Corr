        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndy, Beth, Charlie, and Daniel take a test with thirty questions. Andy and Beth together get the same number of questions wrong as Charlie and Daniel together. Andy and Daniel together get four more questions wrong than Beth and Charlie do together. If Charlie gets five questions wrong, how many questions does Andy get wrong?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the number of questions each person gets wrong as follows:\n\n* Andy: A\n* Beth: B\n* Charlie: C = 5\n* Daniel: D\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n1. A + B = C + D \n2. A + D = B + C + 4\n\nSubstituting C = 5 into the second equation, we get:\n\nA + D = B + 9\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:\n\n(A + D) - (A + B) = (B + 9) - (C + D)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nD - B = B + 9 - 5 - D\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n2D - 2B = 4\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nD - B = 2\n\nSubstituting this back into the first equation:\n\nA + B = 5 + (B + 2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nA = 7\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the number of questions Andy got wrong, $b$ the number of questions Beth missed, $c$ the number of questions Charlie answered incorrectly, and $d$ the number of questions Daniel got wrong. Using the information given in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na + b &= c + d \\\\\na + d &= b+c +4 \\\\\nc = 5\n\\end{align*} Adding the first two equations together yields $2a + b + d = 2c + b + d + 4$, which simplifies to $a = c + 2$. Since $c = 5$, Andy must have answered $\\boxed{7}$ questions incorrectly."
