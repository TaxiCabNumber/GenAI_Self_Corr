        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 are a set of four consecutive even numbers. Suppose the sum of five consecutive even numbers is 320. What is the smallest of the five numbers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the smallest of the five consecutive even numbers $x$. Then the other four numbers are $x+2$, $x+4$, $x+6$, and $x+8$.  The sum of these five numbers is $x+(x+2)+(x+4)+(x+6)+(x+8)=5x+20$.  We are given that this sum is equal to 320, so $5x+20=320$.  Subtracting 20 from both sides gives $5x=300$, and dividing both sides by 5 gives $x=\\boxed{60}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "$\\underline{\\text{Method 1}}$\n\nThe middle term of an arithmetic sequence containing an odd number of terms is always the average of the terms in the sequence.  In this case, the average of the numbers is $\\frac{320}{5} = 64$, which is also the third term. Counting back by twos, we find that the required number is $\\boxed{60}$.\n\n$\\underline{\\text{Method 2}}$\n\nRepresent the middle number by $n$. Then the five consecutive even numbers are $n-4, n-2, n, n+2$, and $n+4$. The sum of the five numbers is $5n$. Since $5n=320$, $n=64$. Thus, the first number, is $n - 4 = \\boxed{60}$."
