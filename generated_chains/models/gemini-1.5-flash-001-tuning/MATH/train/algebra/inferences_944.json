        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pen and its ink refill together cost $\\;\\$1.10$. The pen costs $\\;\\$1$ more than the ink refill. What is the cost of the pen in dollars?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the cost of the ink refill.  Then the pen costs $x+1$ dollars.  Since the pen and ink refill together cost $1.10, we have the equation $x+(x+1)=1.10$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=0.05$.  Therefore, the pen costs $0.05+1=\\boxed{1.05}$ dollars. Final Answer: $\\boxed{1.05}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Begin by assigning variables.  Let $p$=the cost of the pen and $i$=the cost of the ink.  From what we are given,\n\\begin{align*}\np+i&=1.10,\\\\\np&=1+i.\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $p$ in the first equation, we find: $1+i+i=1.10$, so $2i=.10$ and $i=.05$. Therefore, $p=1+i=\\boxed{1.05}$ dollars."

        "inference": "The error is that the solution assumes the ink refill costs $x$ dollars. However, the problem states that the pen costs $x + 1$ dollars. Let $y$ be the cost of the ink refill. Then the pen costs $y + 1$ dollars.  Since the pen and ink refill together cost $1.10, we have the equation $y + (y+1) = 1.10$. Solving for $y$, we find $y = 0.05$. Therefore, the pen costs $0.05 + 1 = \\boxed{1.05}$ dollars. \n",
