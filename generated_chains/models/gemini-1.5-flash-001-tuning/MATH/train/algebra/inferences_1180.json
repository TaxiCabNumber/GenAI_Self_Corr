At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two positive integers is 50 and their difference  is 12. What is the value of the positive difference of the squares of the integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$. We are given that $x+y=50$ and $x-y=12$.  Adding these equations, we get $2x=62$, so $x=31$. Substituting into the equation $x+y=50$, we get $31+y=50$, so $y=19$.  Therefore, the positive difference of the squares of the integers is $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)=50\\cdot12=\\boxed{600}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the two integers $x$ and $y$. Without loss of generality, let $x$ be the larger of the two. We are given that $x+y = 50$ and $x-y = 12$, and we are asked for $x^2 - y^2$. Because $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, we can simply substitute in to get $x^2 - y^2 = 50 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{600}$."
