At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow much money should I invest at an annually compounded interest rate of $5\\%$  so that I have $\\$500,\\!000$ in ten years?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.",
        "inference": "Let $P$ be the principal amount you need to invest. After one year, you will have $1.05P$ dollars. After two years, you will have $1.05(1.05P) = 1.05^2P$ dollars.  In general, after $n$ years, you will have $1.05^nP$ dollars.  We want this to be equal to $\\$500,\\!000$, so we want to solve the equation $1.05^{10}P = 500,\\!000$.  Dividing both sides by $1.05^{10}$, we find $P = \\frac{500,\\!000}{1.05^{10}} \\approx 306,\\!956.63$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$306,\\!956.63}$. I hope it is correct.",
