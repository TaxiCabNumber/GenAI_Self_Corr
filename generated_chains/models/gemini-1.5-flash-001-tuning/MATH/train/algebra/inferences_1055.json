At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the sum of the second and fourth terms of an arithmetic sequence is $6$, what is the third term?",

        "ground_truth": "Call the second term $a$, and the difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. So, the third term is $a+x$, and the fourth term is $a+2x$. Adding the second and fourth terms gives $2a+2x$, which is simply twice the third term. So the third term is $\\frac{6}{2} = \\boxed{3}$."
