        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne root of the equation $5x^2+kx=4$ is 2. What is the other?",
        "inference": "Since 2 is a root of the equation, we can plug in $x=2$ and solve for $k$:\n\n$5(2)^2 + k(2) = 4$\n$20 + 2k = 4$\n$2k = -16$\n$k = -8$\n\nNow we have the equation $5x^2 - 8x = 4$.  We can rearrange this into standard quadratic form:\n\n$5x^2 - 8x - 4 = 0$\n\nTo find the other root, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nWhere $a = 5$, $b = -8$, and $c = -4$.  Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 4(5)(-4)}}{2(5)}$\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{144}}{10}$\n$x = \\frac{8 \\pm 12}{10}$\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n$x = \\frac{8 + 12}{10} = 2$ \n$x = \\frac{8 - 12}{10} = -\\frac{2}{5}$\n\nWe already know that 2 is a root, so the other root must be $-\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Rearranging the given equation, we get $5x^2+kx-4=0$. That means that the product of the roots of the equation is $-4/5$. If one of the roots of the equation is 2, then the other must be $(-4/5)/2=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}$."
