At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation of the line that passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-2, 0)$ gives us $0 = -2m + b$ and $(0, 2)$ gives us $2 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $0 = -2m + 2$.  So $m = 1$ and $m + b = \\boxed{3}$."
