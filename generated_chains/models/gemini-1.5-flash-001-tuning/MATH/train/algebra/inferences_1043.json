At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe geometric series $a+ar+ar^2+\\cdots$ has a sum of $12$, and the terms involving odd powers of $r$ have a sum of $5.$ What is $r$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe sum of the geometric series is $\\frac{a}{1-r} = 12$. The sum of the terms involving odd powers of $r$ is $ar + ar^3 + ar^5 + \\dots = \\frac{ar}{1-r^2} = 5$. Dividing the second equation by the first equation gives us $\\frac{r}{1+r} = \\frac{5}{12}$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.",
