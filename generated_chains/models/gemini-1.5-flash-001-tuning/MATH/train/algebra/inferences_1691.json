At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $y$-intercept of the line $x - 2y = 5$?",
        "inference": "To find the $y$-intercept, we set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$. \n\nSubstituting $x = 0$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$0 - 2y = 5$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$-2y = 5$\n\nDividing both sides by $-2$, we get:\n\n$y = -\\frac{5}{2}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The $y$-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the $y$-axis.  The $x$-coordinate of such a point is 0.  Setting $x=0$ in the equation gives $-2y = 5$, so $y = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$."
