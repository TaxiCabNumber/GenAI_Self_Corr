        "inference": "The solution is incorrect.  The given information is not enough to determine the area of the rectangle. Here's why:\n\n* **Angles don't determine side lengths:**  Knowing that angles are equal doesn't tell us the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. We need more information to determine the area.\n\n**To find the area, we need at least one side length of the rectangle.** \n\nTherefore, we cannot provide a solution to this problem. \n",
