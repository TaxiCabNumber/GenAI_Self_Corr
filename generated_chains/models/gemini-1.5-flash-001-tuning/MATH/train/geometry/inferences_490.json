The coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are $(12,19)$ and $(23,20),$ respectively, and the coordinates of $A$ are $(p,q).$ The line containing the median to side $BC$ has slope $-5.$ Find the largest possible value of $p+q.$\n[asy]defaultpen(fontsize(8)); size(170); pair A=(15,32), B=(12,19), C=(23,20), M=B/2+C/2, P=(17,22); draw(A--B--C--A);draw(A--M);draw(B--P--C); label(\"A (p,q)\",A,(1,1));label(\"B (12,19)\",B,(-1,-1));label(\"C (23,20)\",C,(1,-1));label(\"M\",M,(0.2,-1)); label(\"(17,22)\",P,(1,1)); dot(A^^B^^C^^M^^P);[/asy]\n",

        "ground_truth": "The midpoint $M$ of line segment $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\left(\\frac{35}{2}, \\frac{39}{2}\\right)$. The equation of the median can be found by $-5 = \\frac{q - \\frac{39}{2}}{p - \\frac{35}{2}}$. Cross multiply and simplify to yield that $-5p + \\frac{35 \\cdot 5}{2} = q - \\frac{39}{2}$, so $q = -5p + 107$.\nUse determinants to find that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{vmatrix}p & 12 & 23 \\\\  q & 19 & 20 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\end{vmatrix} = 70$ (note that there is a missing absolute value; we will assume that the other solution for the triangle will give a smaller value of $p+q$, which is provable by following these steps over again). We can calculate this determinant to become $140 = \\begin{vmatrix} 12 & 23 \\\\ 19 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} - \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 23 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 12 & 19 \\end{vmatrix}$ $\\Longrightarrow 140 = 240 - 437 - 20p + 23q + 19p - 12q$ $= -197 - p + 11q$. Thus, $q = \\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11}$.\nSetting this equation equal to the equation of the median, we get that $\\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11} = -5p + 107$, so $\\frac{56}{11}p = \\frac{107 \\cdot 11 + 337}{11}$. Solving produces that $p = 15$. Substituting backwards yields that $q = 32$; the solution is $p + q = \\boxed{47}$."
