        "ground_truth": "We use coordinates. Let the circle have center $(0,0)$ and radius $\\sqrt{50}$; this circle has equation $x^2 + y^2 = 50$. Let the coordinates of $B$ be $(a,b)$. We want to find $a^2 + b^2$. $A$ and $C$ with coordinates $(a,b+6)$ and $(a+2,b)$, respectively, both lie on the circle. From this we obtain the system of equations\n$a^2 + (b+6)^2 = 50$\n$(a+2)^2 + b^2 = 50$\nSolving, we get $a=5$ and $b=-1$, so the distance is $a^2 + b^2 = \\boxed{26}$."
