At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circular spinner for a game has a radius of 5 cm. The probability of winning on one spin of this spinner is $\\frac{2}{5}$. What is the area, in sq cm, of the WIN sector? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]import graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),25),black);\ndraw((0,0)--(7,18),Arrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,25));\ndraw((0,0)--(15,-20));\nlabel(\"WIN\",(10,10),S);\nlabel(\"LOSE\",(-8,-8),N);\ndot((0,0));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The probability of winning is the ratio of the area of the WIN sector to the area of the entire circle.  The area of the entire circle is $\\pi (5^2) = 25\\pi$ square centimeters.  Since the probability of winning is $\\frac{2}{5}$, the area of the WIN sector is $\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 25\\pi = \\boxed{10\\pi}$ square centimeters. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The probability of winning on one spin is equal to the ratio of the area of the WIN sector to the area of the entire circle. The area of the entire circle is $\\pi \\cdot 5^2 = 25\\pi$. In math terms, our ratio is: $\\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{\\text{area of the win sector}}{25\\pi}$. Solving for the area of the win sector, we find it equal to $\\boxed{10\\pi}$ square centimeters."
