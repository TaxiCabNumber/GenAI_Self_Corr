At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne leg of a right triangle is 12 inches, and the measure of the angle opposite that leg is $30^\\circ$. What is the number of inches in the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
