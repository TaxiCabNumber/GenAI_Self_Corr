We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each.
