        "inference": "Let the two equal sides have length $x$, and the third side have length $y$.  Then $2x + y = 23$, so $y = 23 - 2x$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $y$ must be odd.  Also, the Triangle Inequality tells us that $x + x > y$, so $2x > 23 - 2x$, which means $x > \\frac{23}{4}$.  Since $x$ is an integer, $x \\ge 6$.

        "ground_truth": "Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6."
