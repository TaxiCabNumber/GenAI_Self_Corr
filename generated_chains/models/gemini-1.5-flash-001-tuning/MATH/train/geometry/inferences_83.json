At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?",
        "inference": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  The sum of the six terms of the sequence is $6a + 15d$.  Since the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720^\\circ$, we have $6a + 15d = 720$.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get $2a + 5d = 240$.\n\nSince the angles are increasing, we know $a + d < a + 2d < \\dots < a + 5d$.  Also, all of the angles are less than $150^\\circ$, so $a + 5d < 150$.\n\nSolving the equation $2a + 5d = 240$ for $a$, we get $a = 120 - \\frac{5}{2} d$.  Substituting this into the inequality $a + 5d < 150$, we get $120 - \\frac{5}{2} d + 5d < 150$, which simplifies to $\\frac{5}{2} d < 30$.  This gives us $d < 12$.\n\nSince $d$ is a positive integer, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.  For each of these values of $d$, we can find a corresponding value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $2a + 5d = 240$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible sequences.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$."
