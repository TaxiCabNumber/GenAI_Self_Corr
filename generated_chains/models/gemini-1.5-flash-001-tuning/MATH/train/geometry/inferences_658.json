At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the diagonals of a rhombus are always perpendicular bisectors of each other, what is the area of a rhombus with side length $\\sqrt{89}$ units and diagonals that differ by 6 units?",
        "inference": "Let the length of the shorter diagonal be $x$ units. Then the length of the longer diagonal is $x+6$ units. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, we can divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, each with legs of length $\\frac{x}{2}$ and $\\frac{x+6}{2}$ units. The hypotenuse of each of these triangles is equal to the side length of the rhombus, which is $\\sqrt{89}$ units. \n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\[\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{x+6}{2}\\right)^2 = (\\sqrt{89})^2.\\] Expanding and simplifying, we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{x^2 + 12x + 36}{4} = 89.\\] Multiplying both sides by 4, we get $x^2 + x^2 + 12x + 36 = 356$, which simplifies to $2x^2 + 12x - 320 = 0$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $x^2 + 6x - 160 = 0$. Factoring the quadratic, we get $(x+16)(x-10) = 0$.  Since the length of a diagonal cannot be negative, we have $x = 10$. Thus, the shorter diagonal has length 10 units and the longer diagonal has length 16 units.\n\nThe area of a rhombus is equal to half the product of its diagonals, so the area of this rhombus is $\\frac{1}{2}(10)(16) = 80$ square units. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
