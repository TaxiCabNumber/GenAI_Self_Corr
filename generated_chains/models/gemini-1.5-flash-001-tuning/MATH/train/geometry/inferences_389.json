At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle measures 6 meters by 10 meters. Drawn on each side of the rectangle is a semicircle that has the endpoints of its diameter on the vertices of the rectangle. What percent larger is the area of the large semicircles than the area of the small semicircles? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "The area of the two large semicircles is equal to the area of a circle with diameter 10 meters. The area of the two small semicircles is equal to the area of a circle with diameter 6 meters. The area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$, so the area of the large semicircles is $\\pi(5^2)=25\\pi$ and the area of the small semicircles is $\\pi(3^2)=9\\pi$. The difference in the areas is $25\\pi - 9\\pi = 16\\pi$. The ratio of the difference in the areas to the area of the small semicircles is $\\frac{16\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{16}{9}$. Multiplying by 100% gives a percentage of approximately $\\boxed{178\\%}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area."
