        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nSince the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters, each face has an area of 24/6 = 4 square meters.  Therefore, each edge of the cube has length $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ meters.  The diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of the edge of the cube, so the diameter of the sphere is 2 meters.  The radius of the sphere is 1 meter.\n\nThe diagonal of a face of the inner cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 2 meters.  Let the side length of the inner cube be $s$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $s^2 + s^2 = 2^2$, so $2s^2 = 4$.  Then $s^2 = 2$, so $s = \\sqrt{2}$.  Each face of the inner cube has area $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ square meters, so the surface area of the inner cube is $6 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ square meters. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters."
