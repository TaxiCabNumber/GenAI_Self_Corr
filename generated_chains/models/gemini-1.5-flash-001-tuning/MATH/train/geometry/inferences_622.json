At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Let a be the smallest possible number with the property that it is always possible to select one pair of points from these five such that the distance between them is equal to or less than $a$. Then $a$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{3}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{2}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{2}$\n",
