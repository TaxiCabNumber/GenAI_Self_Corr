I hope it is correct.'\nA delicious circular pie with diameter $12\\text{ cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$?",

Since the pie is cut into three equal pieces, the diameter of each piece is the same as the diameter of the whole pie, which is 12 cm.
