        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA whole block of modeling clay is a right rectangular prism six inches by two inches by one inch. How many whole blocks need to be unwrapped to mold a cylindrical sculpture seven inches high and four inches in diameter?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n- The volume of the rectangular prism is $6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 12$ cubic inches.\n- The radius of the cylinder is $4/2 = 2$ inches.\n- The volume of the cylinder is $\\pi r^2 h = \\pi \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 7 = 28\\pi$ cubic inches.\n- We need $28 \\pi / 12 \\approx 7.33$ blocks. \n- Since we cannot use parts of blocks, we need 8 whole blocks.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The cylindrical sculpture has radius two inches and uses $\\pi(2^2)(7)=28\\pi \\approx 87.96$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  Each block contains $(6)(2)(1)=12$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  If we have 7 blocks, then we have 84 cubic inches of clay which is not enough, so we need $\\boxed{8}$ blocks of clay, and we see 96 cubic inches are indeed enough."
