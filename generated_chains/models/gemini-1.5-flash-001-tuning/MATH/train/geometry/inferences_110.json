        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?",
        "inference": "Let the original radius of the cylinder be $r$ and the original height be $h$.  The original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.  Doubling the height gives us a height of $2h$.  Increasing the radius by $200\\%$ gives us a radius of $3r$.  The new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2 (2h) = 18\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus, the volume is multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$."
