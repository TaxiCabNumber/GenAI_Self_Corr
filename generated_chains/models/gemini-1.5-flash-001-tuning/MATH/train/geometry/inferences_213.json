We also know that the sum of the measures of the angles of $\\triangle ABC$ equals $180$ degrees. Thus, if we let $x = $ the measure of $\\angle CAB$ = the measure of $\\angle BCA$, we have that $180 = 108 + x + x \\Rightarrow 2x = 72 \\Rightarrow x = 36$. The measure of angle $CAB$ is $\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
