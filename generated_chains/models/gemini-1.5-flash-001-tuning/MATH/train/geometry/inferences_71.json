        "inference": "The solution correctly finds the volume of the rectangular prism as $abc = 70\\sqrt{6}$.  However, the problem asks for the sum of the lengths of all the edges, not the volume.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe sum of the lengths of all the edges is $4a + 4b + 4c = 4(a+b+c)$.  To find $a+b+c$, we can use the given information and the fact that $a^2b^2c^2 = (abc)^2 = (70\\sqrt{6})^2 = 29400$.\n\nWe have $ab = 48$, $ac = 49$, and $bc = 50$.  Adding these equations, we get $ab + ac + bc = 147$.  Squaring this equation, we get \n\n$$(ab + ac + bc)^2 = 147^2$$\n\nExpanding the left side and simplifying, we get\n\n$$a^2b^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2abc(a+b+c) = 21609$$\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get\n\n$$2304 + 2401 + 2500 + 2(70\\sqrt{6})(a+b+c) = 21609$$\n\nSolving for $a+b+c$, we find $a+b+c = \\frac{16394}{140\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{8197}{70\\sqrt{6}}$.  Finally, the sum of the lengths of all the edges is \n\n$$4(a+b+c) = 4\\left(\\frac{8197}{70\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = \\boxed{\\frac{16394}{35\\sqrt{6}}}.$$ \n",
