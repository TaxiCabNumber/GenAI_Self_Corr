At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of triangle $APM$ is $152$, and the angle $PAM$ is a right angle. A circle of radius $19$ with center $O$ on $\\overline{AP}$ is drawn so that it is tangent to $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{PM}$. Given that $OP=m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\n",
        "inference": "Let $x = AP$ and $y = AM$. Then $PM = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. We know $x + y + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 152$.\n\nSince the circle is tangent to $AM$ and $PM$, $OA$ is perpendicular to $AM$ and $OP$ is perpendicular to $PM$. Therefore, $OA = 19$ and $OP = 19$. We also know that $AP = x = OA + OP = 19 + 19 = 38$.\n\nSubstituting $x = 38$ into the equation $x + y + \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 152$, we get $38 + y + \\sqrt{38^2 + y^2} = 152$. Simplifying, we get $y + \\sqrt{38^2 + y^2} = 114$. Subtracting $y$ from both sides, we get $\\sqrt{38^2 + y^2} = 114 - y$. Squaring both sides, we get $38^2 + y^2 = (114 - y)^2$. Expanding, we get $1444 + y^2 = 12996 - 228y + y^2$. Simplifying, we get $228y = 11552$, so $y = 50.67$.\n\nTherefore, $OP = 19 = m/n$, so $m = 19$ and $n = 1$. Therefore, $m + n = 19 + 1 = 20$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the circle intersect $\\overline{PM}$ at $B$. Then note $\\triangle OPB$ and $\\triangle MPA$ are similar. Also note that $AM = BM$ by power of a point. Using the fact that the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their perimeters, we have\\[\\frac{19}{AM} = \\frac{152-2AM-19+19}{152} = \\frac{152-2AM}{152}\\]Solving, $AM = 38$. So the ratio of the side lengths of the triangles is 2. Therefore,\\[\\frac{PB+38}{OP}= 2 \\text{ and } \\frac{OP+19}{PB} = 2\\]so $2OP = PB+38$ and $2PB = OP+19.$ Substituting for $PB$, we see that $4OP-76 = OP+19$, so $OP = \\frac{95}3$ and the answer is $\\boxed{98}$."
