Since the circle centered at $(2,1)$ is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect $l$. Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at $(5,2)$ is on $l$. Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between $(0,0)$ and $(7,3)$ that intersect $l$. Since there are $\\frac{1001}{7} = \\frac{429}{3} = 143$ segments from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$, the above count is yields $143 \\cdot 2 = 286$ squares. Since every lattice point on $l$ is of the form $(3k, 7k)$ where $0 \\le k \\le 143$, there are $144$ lattice points on $l$. Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts $288$ squares and circles. Thus $m + n = 286 + 288 = \\boxed{574}$."
