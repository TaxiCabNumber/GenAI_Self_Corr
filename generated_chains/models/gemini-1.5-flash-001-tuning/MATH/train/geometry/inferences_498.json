        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the box be $l$, $w$, and $h$.  We are given that $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$.  Multiplying these equations together, we get $l^2 w^2 h^2 = 24 \\cdot 16 \\cdot 6 = 2304$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $lwh = 48$.  Since $lwh$ is the volume of the box, the volume is $\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches. Final Answer: $\\boxed{48}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches."
