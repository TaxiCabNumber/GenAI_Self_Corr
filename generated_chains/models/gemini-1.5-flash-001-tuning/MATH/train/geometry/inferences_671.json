        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?",
        "inference": "The volume of the larger pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}(12^2)(8)=384$ cubic centimeters.  The volume of the smaller pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}(6^2)(4)=48$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the volume of the frustum is $384-48=\\boxed{336}$ cubic centimeters.  I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]"
