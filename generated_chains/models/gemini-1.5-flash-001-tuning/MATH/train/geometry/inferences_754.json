At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe dimensions of a triangle are tripled to form a new triangle. If the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet, how many square feet were in the area of the original triangle?",

That means the original triangle must have an area of $\\dfrac{54\\text{ ft}^2}{9} = \\boxed{6}\\text{ ft}^2.$"
