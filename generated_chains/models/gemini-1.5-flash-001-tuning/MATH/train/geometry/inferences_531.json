Given that $AB = 12$ and $\\angle O_{1}PO_{2} = 120^{\\circ}$, then $AP = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Find $a + b$.\n",
        "inference": "Since $AB = 12$, the side length of the square is $12$. Therefore $AC = 12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $O_{1}$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABP$, $AO_{1} = BO_{1} = PO_{1}$. Similarly, $CO_{2} = DO_{2} = PO_{2}$. Therefore, triangles $AO_{1}P$ and $CO_{2}P$ are isosceles.\n\nLet $\\angle O_{1}PA = \\angle O_{1}AP = x$ and $\\angle O_{2}PC = \\angle O_{2}CP = y$. Then $\\angle O_{1}PO_{2} = x + y = 120^{\\circ}$.\n\nBy the Angle Bisector Theorem on triangle $ABP$, $\\frac{AP}{PB} = \\frac{AO_{1}}{BO_{1}} = 1$, so $AP = PB$. Similarly, $CP = PD$.\n\nSince $\\angle O_{1}PA = x$, we have $\\angle BAP = 90 - x$. Since $\\angle O_{2}PC = y$, we have $\\angle DCP = 90 - y$.\n\nThe angle at $P$ in triangle $BPD$ is $90 + x + y = 210^{\\circ}$. Therefore, $\\angle BPD = 30^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle BDP = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus, $\\triangle BPD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.

Because they are the circumcenters, both Os lie on the perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $CD$ and these bisectors go through $E$ and $F$.\nIt is given that $\\angle O_{1}PO_{2}=120^{\\circ}$. Because $O_{1}P$ and $O_{1}B$ are radii of the same circle, the have the same length. This is also true of $O_{2}P$ and $O_{2}D$.

Using the given information above and symmetry, $m\\angle DPB = 120^{\\circ}$. Because ABP and ADP share one side, have one side with the same length, and one equal angle, they are congruent by SAS. This is also true for triangle CPB and CPD. Because angles APB and APD are equal and they sum to 120 degrees, they are each 60 degrees. Likewise, both angles CPB and CPD have measures of 120 degrees.\nBecause the interior angles of a triangle add to 180 degrees, angle ABP has measure 75 degrees and angle PDC has measure 15 degrees. Subtracting, it is found that both angles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ have measures of 30 degrees. Thus, both triangles $O_{1}BF$ and $O_{2}DE$ are 30-60-90 right triangles. Because F and E are the midpoints of AB and CD respectively, both FB and DE have lengths of 6. Thus, $DO_{2}=BO_{1}=4\\sqrt{3}$.
