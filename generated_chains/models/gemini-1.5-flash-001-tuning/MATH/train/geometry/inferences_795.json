At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?",
