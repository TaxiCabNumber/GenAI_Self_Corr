Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{315}$.\nNote: There is another solution where the point $b+37i$ is a rotation of $-60$ degrees of $a+11i$; however, this triangle is just a reflection of the first triangle by the $y$-axis, and the signs of $a$ and $b$ are flipped. However, the product $ab$ is unchanged."
