At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle.

        "ground_truth": "It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$.
