At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. A particular solid right cylinder of radius 2 feet has a total surface area of $12\\pi$ square feet. What is the height of this cylinder?",
