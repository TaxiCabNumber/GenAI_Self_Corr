        "inference": "The vertical cross section of the cone is an equilateral triangle, so the radius of the base of the cone is equal to the height of the cone. Let the height of the cone be $h$.  Then the radius of the base is also $h$, and the volume of the cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi h^2 \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi h^3$.  Setting this equal to $12288\\pi$, we get $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi h^3 = 12288\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\pi$ and multiplying both sides by 3, we get $h^3 = 36864$.  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $h = \\boxed{32}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{32}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
