        "inference": "By Power of a Point, $AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot DP$. We know $AP = 8$, $PC = 1$, and $BD = 6 = BP + DP$.  Let $BP = x$, so $DP = 6-x$.  Substituting, we have $8 \\cdot 1 = x(6-x)$.  Expanding, we have $8 = 6x - x^2$, or $x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0$.  This factors as $(x-2)(x-4) = 0$, so $x=2$ or $x=4$.  Since $BP < DP$, we have $BP = \\boxed{2}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Writing $BP=x$ and $PD=6-x$, we have that $BP < 3$. Power of a point at $P$ gives $AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot PD$ or $8=x(6-x)$. This can be solved for $x=2$ and $x=4$, and we discard the latter, leaving $BP = \\boxed{2}$."
