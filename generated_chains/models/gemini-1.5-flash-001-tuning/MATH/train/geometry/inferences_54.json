        "ground_truth": "Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$.
