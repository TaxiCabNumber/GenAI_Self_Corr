I hope it is correct.'\nA telephone pole is supported by a steel cable which extends from the top of the pole to a point on the ground 3 meters from its base. When Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole toward the point where the cable is attached to the ground, her head just touches the cable. Leah is 1.5 meters tall. How many meters tall is the pole?",
