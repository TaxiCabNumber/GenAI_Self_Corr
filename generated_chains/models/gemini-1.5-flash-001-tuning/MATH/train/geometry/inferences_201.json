At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEither increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?",
        "inference": "Let the original radius be $r$.  The original volume is $\\pi r^2 \\cdot 2 = 2\\pi r^2$.  Increasing the radius by 6 inches gives a volume of $\\pi (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$, and increasing the height by 6 inches gives a volume of $\\pi r^2 \\cdot 8$.  Setting these equal, we have \\[\\pi(r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi r^2 \\cdot 8.\\] Dividing both sides by $2\\pi$ gives $(r+6)^2 = 4r^2$.  Expanding, we have $r^2 + 12r + 36 = 4r^2$.  Combining like terms, we have $3r^2 - 12r - 36 = 0$.  Dividing by 3, we have $r^2 - 4r - 12 = 0$.  Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2) = 0$.  Since the radius cannot be negative, $r=\\boxed{6}$.

The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$.
