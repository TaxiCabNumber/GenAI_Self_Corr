What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?",

The diagonal of the smaller square is equal to the diameter of the circle, so the diagonal of the smaller square is $s$.  If we let the side length of the smaller square be $t$, then by the Pythagorean Theorem, $t^2 + t^2 = s^2$, so $2t^2 = s^2$.
