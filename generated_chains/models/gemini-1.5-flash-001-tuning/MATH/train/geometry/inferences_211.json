At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe angles of quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfy  $\\angle A = 2\\angle B =\n3\\angle C = 4\\angle D$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle A$, rounded to the nearest whole number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of $\\angle D$.  Then $\\angle C = \\frac{4}{3} x$, $\\angle B = \\frac{4}{2} x = 2x$, and $\\angle A = \\frac{4}{1} x = 4x$.  Since the angles of a quadrilateral add up to $360^\\circ$, we have  \\[x + \\frac{4}{3} x + 2x + 4x = 360^\\circ.\\] Solving for $x$, we find $x = 36^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle A = 4x = \\boxed{144^\\circ}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{144^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the degree measure of $\\angle A$.  Then the degree measures of angles $B$, $C$,  and $D$ are $x/2$, $x/3$, and $x/4$, respectively.  The degree measures of the four angles have a sum of 360, so \\[\n360 = x+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{x}{4} =\n\\frac{25x}{12}.\n\\]Thus $x=(12\\cdot 360)/25 = 172.8\\approx \\boxed{173}$."
