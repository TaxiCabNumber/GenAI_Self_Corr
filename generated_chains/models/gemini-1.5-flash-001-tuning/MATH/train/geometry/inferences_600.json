At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe six edges of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ measure $7, 13, 18, 27, 36$ and $41$ units. If the length of edge $AB$ is $41$, then the length of edge $CD$ is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 27\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 36$\n",
        "inference": "The sum of the lengths of the opposite edges of a tetrahedron is constant. This is known as the **opposite edges theorem**. Therefore, we have $7+13+18+36 = 41+CD$, so $CD = \\boxed{27}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "By the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$. We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$. This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality. Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time. In any case, the answer is $CD = \\boxed{13}$."

The Opposite Edges Theorem states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of opposite edges of a tetrahedron is constant. \n\nTo solve for $CD$, we need to use this theorem:\n\n* Let the tetrahedron be $ABCD$.\n* We are given: $AB=7$, $AC=13$, $AD=18$, $BC=36$, and $BD=41$.\n* Using the Opposite Edges Theorem:  $AB^2+CD^2 = AC^2 + BD^2$ \n* Substituting the known values: $7^2 + CD^2 = 13^2 + 41^2$\n* Solving for $CD^2$: $CD^2 = 13^2 + 41^2 - 7^2 = 1809$\n* Taking the square root: $CD = \\sqrt{1809} = 42.53$ (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the final solution is: \\\\boxed{42.53} \n",
