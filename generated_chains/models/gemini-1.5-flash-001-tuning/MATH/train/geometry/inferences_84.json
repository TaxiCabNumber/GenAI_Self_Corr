At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 4 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$.  The perimeter is $3s$.  So, the ratio of the area to the perimeter is $\\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2}{3s} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}s$.  Substituting $s=4$, we get $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}(4)=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of this equilateral triangle is $\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, and the perimeter is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$."
