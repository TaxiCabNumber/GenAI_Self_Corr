At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ is a right isosceles triangle. Points $D$, $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. Point $G$ is the midpoint of segment $DF$ and point $H$ is the midpoint of segment $FE$. What is the ratio of the shaded area to the non-shaded area in triangle $ABC$?
