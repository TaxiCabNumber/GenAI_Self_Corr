At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{360}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches."
