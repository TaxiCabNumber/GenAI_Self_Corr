        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that the shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the areas of the three smaller semicircles. The shaded region is actually the area of the large semicircle minus the areas of the two smaller semicircles on diameters $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThe area of the large semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(4^2)=8\\pi$.
