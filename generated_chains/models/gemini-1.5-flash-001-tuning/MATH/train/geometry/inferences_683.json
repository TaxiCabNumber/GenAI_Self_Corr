At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(-2, 0)$, $B(1, 4)$ and $C(-3, 2)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $C$ to $C'$?",
