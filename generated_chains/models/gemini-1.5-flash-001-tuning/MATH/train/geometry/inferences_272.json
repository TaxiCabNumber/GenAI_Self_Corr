        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe fly's first journey across the ceiling is a diameter of the circle, so it is 2 * 58 = 116 feet long.\nThe fly's second journey is a chord of the circle.\nSince the third journey was 80 feet long, and it is a chord of the circle, we can find the length of the radius using the Pythagorean Theorem.\nLet x be the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord, which is also the length of the radius.\nThen, x^2 + 40^2 = 58^2\nThis simplifies to x^2 = 58^2 - 40^2 = 1904\nSo, x = sqrt(1904) = 43.63 feet.\nSince the radius of the circle is 58 feet, we know that the distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of the chord is 43.63 feet.\nTherefore, the length of the chord is 2 * sqrt(58^2 - 43.63^2) = 2 * sqrt(1056.25) = 92 feet.\nThe fly travels a total of 116 + 92 + 80 = 288 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{288}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet. The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \\boxed{280}$ feet."
