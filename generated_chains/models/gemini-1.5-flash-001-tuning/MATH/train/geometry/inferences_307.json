        "inference": "Let $A=(-3,-1)$ and $B=(5,3)$.  Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, so $M=\\left(\\frac{-3+5}{2},\\frac{-1+3}{2}\\right)=(1,1)$.  Since the line $y=mx+b$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$, it passes through $M$.  Substituting $(1,1)$ into the equation $y=mx+b$, we get $1=m+b$.  Thus, $m+b=\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\\left(\\frac{5-3}2,\\frac{3-1}2\\right)=(1,1)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$.  Thus $m+b=\\boxed{1}.$"
