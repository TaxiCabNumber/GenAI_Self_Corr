Given that the volume of this set is $\\frac{m + n\\pi}{p},$ where $m, n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, and $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",

To find the volume of the set of points within one unit of the box, we can think of adding a layer of thickness $1$ on each of the six faces, and adding \"corner pieces\" to fill in the gaps.\n\nEach face has area $12$, $15$, or $20$, so the six faces contribute a total of $2(12+15+20)=104$ to the volume.\n\nEach edge has length $3$, $4$, or $5$, and the \"corner pieces\" are like quarter cylinders of radius $1$ and length equal to the edge length.
