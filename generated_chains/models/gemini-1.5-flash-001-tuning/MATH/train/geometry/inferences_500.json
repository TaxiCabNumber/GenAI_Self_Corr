At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEight circles of diameter 1 are packed in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane as shown. Let region $\\mathcal{R}$ be the union of the eight circular regions. Line $l,$ with slope 3, divides $\\mathcal{R}$ into two regions of equal area. Line $l$'s equation can be expressed in the form $ax=by+c,$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers whose greatest common divisor is 1.
