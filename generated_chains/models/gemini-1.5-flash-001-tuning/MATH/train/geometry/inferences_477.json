I hope it is correct.'\nIn a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the larger tetrahedron be $s$.  Then the height of the larger tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}s$, and the height of a face is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.  The distance from the center of a face to a vertex is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the height of the face, so the side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}s$.  The ratio of the volumes of the two tetrahedra is the cube of the ratio of their side lengths, so the ratio is $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{72}$.  Therefore, $m+n = 1 + 72 = \\boxed{73}$. \n",
