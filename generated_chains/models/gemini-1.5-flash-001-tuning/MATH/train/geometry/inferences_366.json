What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.  Therefore, the ratio of the sides of the larger triangle to the sides of the smaller triangle is $\\sqrt{150/6} = 5$.  The hypotenuse of the larger triangle is $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ inches.  Let the legs of the larger triangle have lengths $a$ and $b$.  Then $a^2 + b^2 = 25^2 = 625$.  Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the legs of the larger triangle to the legs of the smaller triangle is also 5.  Let the lengths of the legs of the smaller triangle be $x$ and $y$.  Then $a = 5x$ and $b = 5y$.  Substituting, we get $(5x)^2 + (5y)^2 = 625$, or $x^2 + y^2 = 25$.  Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6, we have $\\frac{1}{2}xy = 6$, or $xy = 12$.  Then $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 25 + 2(12) = 49$, so $x+y = 7$.  Therefore, $a + b = 5x + 5y = 5(x+y) = 5 \\cdot 7 = 35$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{35}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle."
