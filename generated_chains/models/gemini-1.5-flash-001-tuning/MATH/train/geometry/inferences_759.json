At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square sheet of paper has area $6 \\text{ cm}^2$. The front is white and the back is black. When the sheet is folded so that point $A$ rests on the diagonal as shown, the visible black area is equal to the visible white area. How many centimeters is $A$ from its original position? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the distance that point $A$ is from its original position. Then, the area of the visible black triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot x = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. The area of the visible white area is $6 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Since these two areas are equal, we have $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 6 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x^2 = 6$, so $x = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{6}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the length of a leg of the black isosceles triangle.  Then the black area is $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is $6-x^2$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}x^2=6-x^2$, we find $x^2=4$, so $x=2$.  The distance from A to its original position is the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have length $x$.  Therefore, A is $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters from its original position."

        "inference": "The error is in assuming the area of the visible white area is $6 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  The white area is not a simple rectangle minus the triangle. \n\nHere's how to solve the problem correctly:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:** The white area consists of two congruent right triangles.  As point A moves, these triangles change size, but their area is always equal.\n2. **Finding the Base of the White Triangles:** When point A moves a distance of $x$, the base of each white triangle is $(6-x)/2$.\n3. **Setting Up the Equation:** The area of the black triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$. The area of each white triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6-x}{2} \\cdot x$. Since the areas of the black triangle and the two white triangles are equal, we have the equation:\n   $$\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6-x}{2} \\cdot x$$\n4. **Solving for x:** Simplifying the equation, we get:\n   $$x^2 = (6-x)x$$\n   $$x^2 = 6x - x^2$$\n   $$2x^2 - 6x = 0$$\n   $$x^2 - 3x = 0$$\n   $$x(x-3) = 0$$\n   $$x = 0 \\text{ or } x=3$$ \n   Since the point A moves, $x = 3$ is the valid solution.\n\n**Final Answer:  $\\boxed{3}$** \n",
