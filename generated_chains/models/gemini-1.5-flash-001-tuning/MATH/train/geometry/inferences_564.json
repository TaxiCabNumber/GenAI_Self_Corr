        "inference": "Let $a = AE = AH$, $b = BF = CI$, $c = DH = GJ$, and $d = FG = IJ$.  Since the areas of triangles $AEH$, $BFIE$, $DHJG$, and $FCGJI$ are all equal to 1, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} a^2 &= 1\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} (b + d) FI &= 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} (c + d) GJ &= 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} d(FI + GJ) &= 1\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, we get $a = \\sqrt{2}$.  From the second and third equations, we get $FI = \\frac{2}{b + d}$ and $GJ = \\frac{2}{c + d}$.  Substituting these into the fourth equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} d \\left( \\frac{2}{b + d} + \\frac{2}{c + d} \\right) = 1$$Simplifying, we get:\n\n$$d(b + c + 2d) = b + c + d$$Since $b = BF$ and $c = DH$ are both sides of squares with area 1, we have $b = c = \\sqrt{2}$.  Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$d(2\\sqrt{2} + 2d) = 2\\sqrt{2} + d$$Solving for $d$, we get $d = 2\\sqrt{2} - 4$.  Finally, we can substitute this value into our expression for $FI$:\n\n$$FI = \\frac{2}{b + d} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{2} - 4} = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2} - 4}$$Rationalizing the denominator, we get:\n\n$$FI = \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2} - 4} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2} + 4}{3\\sqrt{2} + 4} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{2} + 8}{2} = 3\\sqrt{2} + 4$$Therefore, $FI^2 = (3\\sqrt{2} + 4)^2 = \\boxed{34}$.",

We see that since triangle $HAE$ is a right isosceles triangle with area 1, we can determine sides $HA$ and $AE$ both to be $\\sqrt{2}$. Now, consider extending $FB$ and $IE$ until they intersect. Let the point of intersection be $K$. We note that $EBK$ is also a right isosceles triangle with side $2-\\sqrt{2}$ and find it's area to be $3-2\\sqrt{2}$. Now, we notice that $FIK$ is also a right isosceles triangle and find it's area to be $\\frac{1}{2}$$FI^2$. This is also equal to $1+3-2\\sqrt{2}$ or $4-2\\sqrt{2}$.
