        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is constant.  Therefore, $\\frac{x}{10}=\\frac{5}{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by $10$ gives $x=\\frac{50}{8}=\\boxed{6.25}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.25}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$."
