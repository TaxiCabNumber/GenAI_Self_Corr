        "inference": "Solution:\n\nLet $x = \\angle ABP = \\angle PBQ = \\angle QBC$, since $BP$ and $BQ$ trisect $\\angle ABC$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $\\angle MBQ = x$, so $\\angle MBP=x$ as well.  Therefore, we have $\\angle PBQ = 2x$, so $\\angle ABP = \\angle PBQ = \\angle QBC = 2x$.

        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* The problem states that BP and BQ trisect angle ABC, meaning they divide it into three equal angles. \n* The solution correctly sets each of those angles to 'x'.\n* BM bisects angle PBQ, meaning it divides that angle into two equal halves, each with a measure of x/2.\n* The ratio of angle MBQ (x/2) to angle ABQ (2x) is indeed 1/4.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**  \n\\\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{4}$} \n",
