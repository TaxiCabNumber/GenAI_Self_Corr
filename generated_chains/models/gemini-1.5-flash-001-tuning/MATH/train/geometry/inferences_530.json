At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{750}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$."
