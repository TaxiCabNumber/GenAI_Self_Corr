Similarly, since $MK$ bisects $\\angle K$, we know that the measure of $\\angle JKM$ is $30/2 = 15$ degrees. Finally, since the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle always equals $180$ degrees, we know that the sum of the measures of $\\angle JKM$, $\\angle KJM$, and $\\angle JMK$ equals $180$ degrees.
