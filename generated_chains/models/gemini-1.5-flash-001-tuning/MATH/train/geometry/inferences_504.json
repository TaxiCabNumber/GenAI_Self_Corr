At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant?\n",

        "ground_truth": "There are $223 \\cdot 9 = 2007$ squares in total formed by the rectangle with edges on the x and y axes and with vertices on the intercepts of the equation, since the intercepts of the lines are $(223,0),\\ (0,9)$.\nCount the number of squares that the diagonal of the rectangle passes through. Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \\frac{223}{9}x$. This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$). At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time. We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.\nThe number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$. Divide this in 2 to get the number of squares in one of the triangles, with the answer being $\\frac{1776}2 = \\boxed{888}$."
