        "inference": "By the Triangle Inequality, $AB+BC > AC$ and $AB+AC > BC$, so $AB > AC-BC = 4-5 = -1$ and $AB > BC-AC = 5-4 = 1$. Also, $AB < AC+BC = 4+5 = 9$. Therefore, the maximum area of $\\triangle ABC$ is obtained when $AB$ is as close to 9 as possible while still satisfying the Triangle Inequality.
