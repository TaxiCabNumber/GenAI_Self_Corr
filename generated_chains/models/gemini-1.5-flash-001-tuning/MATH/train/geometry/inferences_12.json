        "ground_truth": "A side of square I has length 3, while a side of square II has length 6 (all sides have equal length).  Therefore, a side of square III has length 9.  Since the side length of square I is $\\frac{1}{3}$ that of square III, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, the ratio of the area of square I to square III is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.   Alternately, you can just calculate the areas: square I has an area of 9, square III has an area of 81, thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$"
