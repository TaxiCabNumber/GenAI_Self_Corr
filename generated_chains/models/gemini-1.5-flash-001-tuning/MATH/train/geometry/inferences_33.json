        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the prism be $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Then $ab=6$, $ac=8$, and $bc=12$.  Multiplying these equations gives $(ab)(ac)(bc)=6\\cdot8\\cdot12$, or $a^2b^2c^2=576$.  Taking the square root of both sides gives $abc=24$.  Since the volume of the prism is $abc$, the volume is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches. Final Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches."
