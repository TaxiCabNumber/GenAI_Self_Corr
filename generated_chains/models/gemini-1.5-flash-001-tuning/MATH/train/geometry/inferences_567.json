The circumcenter $O$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, and the incenter $I$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\\triangle{ABC}$. Since $\\angle{C}=90^\\circ$, $I$ lies on the hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, and so $O$, $I$, and $C$ are collinear. Since the circle with center $M$ is tangent to $AC$, $BC$, and the circumcircle of $\\triangle{ABC}$, $M$ is the center of the incircle of $\\triangle{ABC}$.
