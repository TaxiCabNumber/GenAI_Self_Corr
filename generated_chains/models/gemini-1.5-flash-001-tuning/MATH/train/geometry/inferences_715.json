At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
