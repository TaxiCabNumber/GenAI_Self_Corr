        "inference": "The area of the shaded region is the area of the large square minus the area of the unshaded region.  The area of the large square is $10^2 = 100$ square inches.  The unshaded region consists of a rectangle and a right triangle.  The rectangle has dimensions 10 inches by 3 inches, and the triangle has base 3 inches and height 7 inches.  Therefore, the area of the unshaded region is $10 \\cdot 3 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = 30 + \\frac{21}{2} = \\frac{81}{2}$ square inches.  The area of the shaded region is then $100 - \\frac{81}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{119}{2}}$ square inches. \n",
