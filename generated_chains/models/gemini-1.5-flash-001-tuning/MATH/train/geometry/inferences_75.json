At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIsosceles triangle $ABE$ of area 100 square inches is cut by $\\overline{CD}$ into an isosceles trapezoid and a smaller isosceles triangle. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square inches. If the altitude of triangle $ABE$ from $A$ is 20 inches, what is the number of inches in the length of $\\overline{CD}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-9,0)--(0,24)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-6,8)--(6,8));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,24),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-9,0),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-6,8),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(6,8),NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(9,0),E);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The area of triangle $CDE$ is $100-75=25$ square inches. Since the altitude from $A$ is 20 inches, the base $BE$ of triangle $ABE$ is $100\\cdot 2/20=10$ inches.  The altitude of triangle $CDE$ is also 20 inches, so the base $CD$ is $25\\cdot 2/20=\\boxed{2.5}$ inches.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The area of triangle $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(BE)(20\\text{ in.})$. Setting this equal to $100$ square inches we find $BE=10$ inches.  The area of triangle $ACD$ is $100-75=25$ square inches.  Since triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ and the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, $CD=\\frac{1}{2}BE=\\boxed{5}$ inches.\n\nAlternatively, because triangles $ACD$ and $ABE$ are similar, the height-to-base ratio is the same for each of them.  In triangle $ABE$, this ratio is $\\frac{20\\text{ in.}}{10\\text{ in.}}=2$.  Therefore, the height of $ACD$ is $2\\cdot CD$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\cdot CD)(CD)=25\\text{ in.}^2$ we find $CD=5$ inches."
