        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution.  The problem is that we can't directly assume $\\angle ADF = 45^\\circ$.  Here's a corrected approach:\n\nLet's use the Law of Cosines on triangles $ADE$ and $ADF$ as before:\n\n* $DE^2 = AD^2 + AE^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AE \\cdot \\cos \\angle ADE = 1 + x^2 - 2x \\cos \\angle ADE$\n* $DF^2 = AD^2 + AF^2 - 2 \\cdot AD \\cdot AF \\cdot \\cos \\angle ADF = 1 + x^2 - 2x \\cos \\angle ADF$\n\nWe know $DE = DF$, so we can set these equations equal:\n\n$1 + x^2 - 2x \\cos \\angle ADE = 1 + x^2 - 2x \\cos \\angle ADF$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$\\cos \\angle ADE = \\cos \\angle ADF$\n\nNow, let's focus on the angles themselves.  We know $\\angle ABD = 45^\\circ$ and $\\angle BDE = \\angle BDF$ (because triangles $BDE$ and $BDF$ are congruent).  Therefore:\n\n* $\\angle ADE = \\angle ABD - \\angle BDE = 45^\\circ - \\angle BDE$\n* $\\angle ADF = \\angle ADC - \\angle CDF = 90^\\circ - \\angle BDF = 90^\\circ - \\angle BDE$\n\nSince $\\cos \\angle ADE = \\cos \\angle ADF$, and both angles are acute, we can conclude that $\\angle ADE = \\angle ADF$.  This means:\n\n$45^\\circ - \\angle BDE = 90^\\circ - \\angle BDE$\n\nThis leads to a contradiction, so our initial assumption that $DE = DF$ must be incorrect.  This means there's no solution where $E$ and $F$ are points on the sides of the square as described. \n\n**Therefore, there is no solution, and the problem likely has an error.** \n",
