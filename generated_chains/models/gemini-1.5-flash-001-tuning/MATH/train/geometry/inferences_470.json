        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Find the length of one side of the cube: \n   - Find the distance between points P and Q using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (8-12)^2 + (1-10)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16 + 81} = \\sqrt{98} = 7\\sqrt{2}$.\n2. Calculate the surface area of the cube:\n   - Each face of the cube has an area of $(7\\sqrt{2})^2 = 98$.\n   - Since there are six faces, the total surface area is $6 \\cdot 98 = 588$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{588}$.
