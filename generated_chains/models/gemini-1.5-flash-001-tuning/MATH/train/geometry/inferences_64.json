At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRectangle $ABCD$ is inscribed in triangle $EFG$ such that side $AD$ of the rectangle is on side $EG$ of the triangle, as shown. The triangle's altitude from $F$ to side $EG$ is 7 inches, and $EG = 10 \\text{ inches}$. The length of segment $AB$ is equal to half the length of segment $AD$. What is the area of rectangle $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport math;\nsize(101);\nreal x = 35/12;\ncurrentpen = linewidth(1)+fontsize(10pt);\npair E1 = (0,0), G = (10,0), F = (3,7), A = (3*x/7,0), D = G - (7*x/7,0), B = extension(E1,F,A,A+(0,1)), C = extension(G,F,D,D+(0,1));\ndraw(E1--F--G--cycle); draw(A--B--C--D); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$E$\",E1,W); label(\"$F$\",F,NNW); label(\"$G$\",G,ESE);\n[/asy]",
