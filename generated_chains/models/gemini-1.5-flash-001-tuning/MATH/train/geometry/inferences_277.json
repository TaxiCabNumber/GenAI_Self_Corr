At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCircle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$."
