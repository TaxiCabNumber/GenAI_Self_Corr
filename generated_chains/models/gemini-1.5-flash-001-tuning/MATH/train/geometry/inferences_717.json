At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of angle $A$.  Then the measure of angle $C$ is $4x$, and the measure of angle $B$ is also $4x$.  Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, we have $x+4x+4x=180^\\circ$, or $9x=180^\\circ$.  Solving for $x$ gives $x=20^\\circ$, so the measure of angle $B$ is $4x=4(20^\\circ)=\\boxed{80^\\circ}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{80}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
