Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\n",

Increasing the radius by 6 gives a volume of $\\pi (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\pi (r^2 + 12r + 36)$.  This is an increase of $2 \\pi (12r + 36) = y$ cubic units.  Increasing the height by 6 gives a volume of $\\pi r^2 \\cdot 8 = 8 \\pi r^2$, an increase of $6 \\pi r^2 = y$.  Equating the two expressions for $y$, we get $2 \\pi (12r + 36) = 6 \\pi r^2$.
