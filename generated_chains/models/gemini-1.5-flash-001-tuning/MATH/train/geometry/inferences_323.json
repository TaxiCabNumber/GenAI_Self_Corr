At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe midpoints of the sides of a triangle with area $T$ are joined to form a triangle with area $M$. What is the ratio of $M$ to $T$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you get a segment which is half as long as the third side of the triangle. Therefore, every side in the smaller triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the side length of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ the area of the larger triangle."
