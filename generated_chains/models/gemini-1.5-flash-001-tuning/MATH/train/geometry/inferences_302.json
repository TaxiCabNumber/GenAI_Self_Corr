At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{324\\pi/\\pi}=18$ units.  Divide the hexagon into six equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the radius of the circle, 18 units.  The area of each equilateral triangle is $(\\sqrt{3}/4)(18^2)=81\\sqrt{3}$ square units, and the area of the hexagon is $6\\cdot 81\\sqrt{3}=\\boxed{486\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{486\\sqrt{3}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$."
