        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is  $r$?",
        "inference": "Let the dimensions of the box be $x$, $y$, and $z$.  Then we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n2xy + 2xz + 2yz &= 384, \\\\\n4x + 4y + 4z &= 112.\n\\end{align*}Dividing the second equation by 4, we get $x + y + z = 28$.  Also, since the box is inscribed in the sphere, the diagonal of the box is equal to the diameter of the sphere, so $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4r^2$.\n\nSquaring the equation $x + y + z = 28$, we get\n\\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz = 784.\\]Then $4r^2 + 384 = 784$, so $4r^2 = 400$, and $r^2 = 100$.  Therefore, $r = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
