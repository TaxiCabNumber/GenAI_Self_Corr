I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?",

Using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$ for the area of a triangle, we have:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base}_{BD} \\cdot \\text{height}_{D\\text{ to }AB}\\]\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base}_{CD} \\cdot \\text{height}_{D\\text{ to }AC}\\]\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base}_{AD} \\cdot \\text{height}_{D\\text{ to }BC}\\]\n\nSince these areas are equal, the three heights are all equal.  This means $D$ lies on the line parallel to $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ that passes through the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nThe centroid of a triangle is the point that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  The midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\left(\\frac{3+6}{2}, \\frac{-2+1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.

Simplifying, we get $y = 5x - 22$.  Thus, $D$ is of the form $(m, 5m - 22)$, and $10m + n = 10m + (5m - 22) = \\boxed{15m - 22}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$."
