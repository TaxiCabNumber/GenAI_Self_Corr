I hope it is correct.'\nIn the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways. The truck travels at $50$ miles per hour along the highways and at $14$ miles per hour across the prairie. Consider the set of points that can be reached by the firetruck within six minutes. The area of this region is $m/n$ square miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

        "inference": "The mistake in the solution is that it incorrectly assumes the firetruck can travel in any direction. The problem states that the firetruck can travel 5 miles along the highways and 1.4 miles across the prairie. This means the firetruck can only travel along the grid formed by the highways and prairie.\n\nThe correct solution is to find the area of the grid that the firetruck can reach within 6 minutes.  Since the firetruck can travel 5 miles along the highways in 6 minutes, it can reach a maximum of 5 miles north, south, east, and west of the intersection. Since the firetruck can travel 1.4 miles across the prairie in 6 minutes, it can reach a maximum of 1.4 miles northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest of the intersection.\n\nThis forms a square with side length 10 miles (5 miles on each side of the intersection) and four squares with side length 1.4 miles in each of the four corners. \n\nThe area of the large square is 100 square miles. The area of each of the four smaller squares is 1.96 square miles. Therefore, the total area the firetruck can reach is $100 + 4 \\cdot 1.96 = 107.84$ square miles. \n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{107.84}$. \n",
