At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?",

        "ground_truth": "Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters."
