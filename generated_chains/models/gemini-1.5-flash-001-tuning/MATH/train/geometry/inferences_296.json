At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let the height of the narrower can be $h$ units. Then the height of the wider can is $3h$ units.  Let the radius of the wider can be $r$ units. The volume of the narrower can is $\\pi (12^2)h = 144\\pi h$ cubic units, and the volume of the wider can is $\\pi r^2(3h) = 3\\pi r^2h$ cubic units. Since the volumes are equal, we have $144\\pi h = 3\\pi r^2h$.  Dividing both sides by $3\\pi h$, we get $48 = r^2$, so $r = \\sqrt{48} = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$ units. Final Answer: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units."
