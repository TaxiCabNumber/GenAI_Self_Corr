Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$. Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$."

It appears to assume that the circle is inscribed within triangle $ABC$, but the problem statement does not say that. \n\nTo solve the problem correctly:\n\n1. **Find the area of triangle ABC:**  Since triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 35 = 210$.\n2. **Find the inradius of triangle ABC:**  The inradius of a triangle is equal to its area divided by its semiperimeter. The semiperimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC + BC + AB) = \\frac{1}{2}(12 + 35 + 37) = 42$.
