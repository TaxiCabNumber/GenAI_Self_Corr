What is the length of the longer side of the rectangle, in centimeters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(30,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((10,10),10));\n[/asy]",

Thus, the area of the rectangle is $32\\pi$.\n\nThe length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, so it is 8 centimeters long. This means that the length of the other side is $32\\pi/8 = \\boxed{4\\pi}$."
