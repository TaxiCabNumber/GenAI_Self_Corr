At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?",

        "ground_truth": "The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units."
