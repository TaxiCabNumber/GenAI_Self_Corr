Using the larger shaded sector, he joins edge $BC$ to edge $BA$ (without overlap) to form a cone of radius 12 centimeters and of volume $432\\pi$ cubic centimeters.  What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $ABC$ of the sector that is not used?

The radius of the cone is also equal to the radius of the base of the sector, so the sector has a radius of 12 centimeters.  The circumference of the base of the sector is $2\\pi(12) = 24\\pi$ centimeters, which is equal to the length of the arc of the sector.  The circumference of the original circle is $2\\pi(9) = 18\\pi$ centimeters.  The ratio of the length of the arc to the circumference of the circle is equal to the ratio of the measure of the central angle of the sector to 360 degrees: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{24\\pi}{18\\pi} &= \\frac{x}{360^\\circ} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad \\frac{4}{3} &= \\frac{x}{360^\\circ} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot 360^\\circ = 480^\\circ.\n\\end{align*} The measure of the central angle of the sector that is not used is $360^\\circ - 480^\\circ = -120^\\circ$.  Since the measure of an angle cannot be negative, we add 360 degrees to get a positive angle measure.

        "inference": "The solution has a fundamental error. The slant height of the cone is **not** equal to the height of the cone.  Here's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $l$ be the slant height of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height, radius, and slant height: $l^2 = r^2 + h^2$.  Substituting the known values, we get $l^2 = 12^2 + 9^2 = 225$, so $l = 15$ centimeters.\n\nThe arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone, which is $2\\pi r = 24\\pi$ centimeters. The radius of the sector is equal to the slant height of the cone, which is 15 centimeters.  The circumference of the original circle is $2\\pi (15) = 30\\pi$ centimeters.\n\nLet $x$ be the central angle of the sector.  We have the proportion $\\frac{x}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{24\\pi}{30\\pi} = \\frac{4}{5}$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot 360^\\circ = 288^\\circ$.  The central angle of the sector that is not used is $360^\\circ - 288^\\circ = \\boxed{72^\\circ}$. \n",
