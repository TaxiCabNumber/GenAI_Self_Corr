        "inference": "You are absolutely right! The solution is incorrect because it assumes the gray region is the difference between the two circles. However, the gray region is a ring formed by the difference between the large circle and a smaller circle *centered within* the larger circle.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $r$ be the radius of the small circle and $R$ be the radius of the large circle.  The area of the large circle is $\\pi R^2$, and the area of the small circle is $\\pi r^2$.  The area of the gray region (the ring) is $\\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi(R^2 - r^2)$.
