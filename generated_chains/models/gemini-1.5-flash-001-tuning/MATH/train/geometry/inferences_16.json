        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe longer leg of a right triangle is $1$ foot shorter than twice the length of the shorter leg. The area of the triangle is $60$ square feet. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in feet?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the length of the shorter leg. Then the longer leg has length $2x-1$.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x \\cdot (2x-1) = 60$, so $x(2x-1) = 120$.  This simplifies to $2x^2 - x - 120 = 0$, which factors as $(2x+15)(x-8) = 0$.  The only positive solution is $x=8$, so the shorter leg has length 8 feet and the longer leg has length $2(8)-1=15$ feet.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$ feet. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ represents the length of the shorter leg, then the two legs are $x$ and $2x-1$. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is the base and the length of the other leg is the height, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}x(2x-1)$. We set this equal to 60 and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(2x^2-x)&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x-120&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(2x+15)(x-8)&=0\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ must be positive, we get that $x=8$. The shorter leg is 8 feet long and the longer leg is $2(8)-1=15$ feet long. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or we recognize that 8 and 15 are part of the Pythagorean triple $8:15:17$. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is $\\boxed{17}$ feet long."
