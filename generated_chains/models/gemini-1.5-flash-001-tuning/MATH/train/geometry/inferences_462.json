The lines whose equations are $8y = 15x$ and $10y = 3x$ contain points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, such that $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$. The length of $PQ$ equals $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
        "inference": "Let the coordinates of $P$ be $(x_1,y_1)$ and the coordinates of $Q$ be $(x_2,y_2)$. Since $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$, we know that $\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}=8$ and $\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}=6$. This gives us $x_1+x_2=16$ and $y_1+y_2=12$.\n\nSince point $P$ lies on the line $8y=15x$, we have $8y_1=15x_1$. Similarly, since point $Q$ lies on the line $10y=3x$, we have $10y_2=3x_2$. \n\nNow we have a system of four equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1+x_2&=16 \\\\\ny_1+y_2&=12 \\\\\n8y_1&=15x_1 \\\\\n10y_2&=3x_2\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving for $x_1$ and $y_1$ in terms of $x_2$ and $y_2$ from the first two equations, we get $x_1=16-x_2$ and $y_1=12-y_2$.
