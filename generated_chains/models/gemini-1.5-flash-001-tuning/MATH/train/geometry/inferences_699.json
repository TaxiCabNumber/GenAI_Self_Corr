At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge?
