Each circle has a diameter of 6 inches. If the circles do not extend beyond the rectangular region, what is the greatest possible distance (in inches) between the centers of the two circles?",

Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches. Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles. This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches. The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles.
