At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of the median to the hypotenuse of an isosceles, right triangle is $10$ units.  What is the length of a leg of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nLet the length of each leg of the isosceles right triangle be $s$.  The median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse has length $20$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $s^2 + s^2 = 20^2$, so $2s^2 = 400$.  Then $s^2 = 200$, so $s = \\sqrt{200} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\\cdot2=20$ units long. Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$ units."
