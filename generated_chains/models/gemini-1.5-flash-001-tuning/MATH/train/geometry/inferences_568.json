        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLisa, a child with strange requirements for her projects, is making a rectangular cardboard box with square bases. She wants the height of the box to be 3 units greater than the side of the square bases. What should the height be if she wants the surface area of the box to be at least 90 square units while using the least amount of cardboard?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the side length of the square base.  Then the height of the box is $x+3$.\n\nThe surface area of the box is the sum of the areas of the top, bottom, and four sides.  The top and bottom each have area $x^2$, and each side has area $x(x+3)$.  Therefore, the surface area of the box is $2x^2 + 4x(x+3)$.\n\nWe are given that the surface area must be at least 90 square units.  This gives us the inequality $2x^2 + 4x(x+3) \\ge 90$.  Simplifying, we get $6x^2 + 12x - 90 \\ge 0$, or $x^2 + 2x - 15 \\ge 0$.  Factoring, we get $(x+5)(x-3) \\ge 0$.  The solution to this inequality is $x \\le -5$ or $x \\ge 3$.  Since the side length of the square base must be positive, we have $x \\ge 3$.\n\nThe height of the box is $x+3$, so the minimum possible height is $3+3 = \\boxed{6}$ units.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$. The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$.  Therefore, we must have $$2x^2+4x(x+3) \\ge 90.$$Expanding the product on the left and rearranging gives $ 2x^2+4x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$, so $6x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$.  Dividing by 6 gives  $x^2+2x-15 \\ge 0$, so  $(x+5)(x-3) \\ge 0$.  Therefore, we have $x \\le -5 \\text{ or } x\\ge 3$. Since the dimensions of the box can't be negative, the least possible length of the side of the base is $3$. This makes the height of the box $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNote that we also could have solved this problem with trial-and-error.  The surface area increases as the side length of the base of the box increases.  If we let this side length be 1, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 1^2 + 4(1)(4) = 18$.  If we let it be 2, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 2^2 + 4(2)(5) = 8 + 40 = 48$.  If we let it be 3, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 3^2 + 4(3)(6) = 18+72 = 90$.  So, the smallest the base side length can be is 3, which means the smallest the height can be is $\\boxed{6}$."
