I hope it is correct.'\nA sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the large cube, which is 9 inches.  Therefore, the radius of the sphere is $\\frac{9}{2}$ inches.  The diagonal of the smaller cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 9 inches.  Let the side length of the smaller cube be $s$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $s^2 + s^2 + s^2 = 9^2$, so $3s^2 = 81$.  Then $s^2 = 27$, so $s = 3\\sqrt{3}$.
