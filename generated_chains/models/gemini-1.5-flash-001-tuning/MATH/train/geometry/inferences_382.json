What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square base, and let $h$ be the height of each triangular face.  Then the area of the square base is $s^2$, and the area of each triangular face is $\\frac{1}{2}sh$.  Since there are four triangular faces, the total surface area of the pyramid is $s^2+4\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}sh=s^2+2sh=432$.  We are also given that $\\frac{1}{2}sh=\\frac{1}{2}s^2$, so $sh=s^2$.  Substituting this into the equation $s^2+2sh=432$, we get $s^2+2s^2=432$, so $3s^2=432$.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get $s^2=144$, so $s=12$.  Then $h=s=12$.

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the area of each triangular face is equal to half the area of the square base. This is not necessarily true.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $s$ be the side length of the square base and $h$ be the height of the pyramid (the perpendicular distance from the apex to the base).  The area of the square base is $s^2$.  The area of each triangular face is $\\frac{1}{2}sh$, so the total surface area of the pyramid is $s^2 + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}sh = s^2 + 2sh = 432$.
