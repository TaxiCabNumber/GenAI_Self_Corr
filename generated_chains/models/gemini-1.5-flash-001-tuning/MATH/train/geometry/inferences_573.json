At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor some positive integers $p$, there is a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with positive integer side lengths, perimeter $p$, right angles at $B$ and $C$, $AB=2$, and $CD=AD$. How many different values of $p<2015$ are possible?\n$\\textbf{(A) }30\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }31\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }61\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }62\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }63$\n",
        "inference": "Let $x=BC$ and $y=AD=CD$.  Then the perimeter is $2+x+y+y=2+x+2y$.  Since $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$ are right angles, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ABC$:\n\\[x^2 = 2^2 + y^2.\\]Then $x^2 - y^2 = 4$, so $(x+y)(x-y) = 4$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x+y$ and $x-y$ must be factors of 4.  The possible pairs $(x+y,x-y)$ are $(4,1)$, $(2,2)$, and $(1,4)$.  Solving for $x$ and $y$ in each case, we find the possible pairs $(x,y)$ are $\\left(\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$, $(2,2)$, and $\\left(\\frac{5}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.  Only the pair $(2,2)$ gives integer values for $x$ and $y$.  Therefore, the perimeter is $2+x+2y=2+2+2\\cdot2=8$.  Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $p$ less than 2015.

        "ground_truth": "Let $BC = x$ and $CD = AD = y$ be positive integers. Drop a perpendicular from $A$ to $CD$ to show that, using the Pythagorean Theorem, that\\[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2.\\]Simplifying yields $x^2 - 4y + 4 = 0$, so $x^2 = 4(y - 1)$. Thus, $y$ is one more than a perfect square.\nThe perimeter $p = 2 + x + 2y = 2y + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2$ must be less than 2015. Simple calculations demonstrate that $y = 31^2 + 1 = 962$ is valid, but $y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025$ is not. On the lower side, $y = 1$ does not work (because $x > 0$), but $y = 1^2 + 1$ does work. Hence, there are 31 valid $y$ (all $y$ such that $y = n^2 + 1$ for $1 \\le n \\le 31$), and so our answer is $\\boxed{31}$"
