At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $\\frac47$. Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

($ax^n$ means there are $a$ ways to get $n$ heads, eg there are $10$ ways to get $2$ heads, and therefore $1$ tail, here.)\nThe sum of the coefficients squared (total number of possible outcomes, squared because the event is occurring twice) is $(4 + 11 + 10 + 3)^2 = 28^2 = 784$ and the sum of the squares of each coefficient (the sum of the number of ways that each coefficient can be chosen by the two people) is $4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2=246$. The probability is then $\\frac{4^2 + 11^2 + 10^2 + 3^2}{28^2}  = \\frac{246}{784} = \\frac{123}{392}$.
