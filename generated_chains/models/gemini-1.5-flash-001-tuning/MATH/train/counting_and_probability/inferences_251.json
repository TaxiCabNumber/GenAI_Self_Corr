At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",

        "ground_truth": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$."
