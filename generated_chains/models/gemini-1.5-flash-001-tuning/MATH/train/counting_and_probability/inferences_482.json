At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBag A has 3 white marbles and 4 black marbles.  Bag B has 6 yellow marbles and 4 blue marbles.  Bag C has 2 yellow marbles and 5 blue marbles.  A marble is drawn at random from Bag A.  If it is white, a marble is drawn at random from Bag B, otherwise, if it is black, a marble is drawn at random from Bag C.  What is the probability that the second marble drawn is yellow?",
