        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bug starts at a vertex of an equilateral triangle. On each move, it randomly selects one of the two vertices where it is not currently located, and crawls along a side of the triangle to that vertex. Given that the probability that the bug moves to its starting vertex on its tenth move is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m + n.$\n",

        "ground_truth": "Let $P_n$ represent the probability that the bug is at its starting vertex after $n$ moves. If the bug is on its starting vertex after $n$ moves, then it must be not on its starting vertex after $n-1$ moves. At this point it has $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance of reaching the starting vertex in the next move. Thus $P_n=\\frac{1}{2}(1-P_{n-1})$. $P_0=1$, so now we can build it up:\n$P_1=0$, $P_2=\\frac{1}{2}$, $P_3=\\frac{1}{4}$, $P_4=\\frac{3}{8}$, $P_5=\\frac{5}{16}$, $P_6=\\frac{11}{32}$, $P_7=\\frac{21}{64}$, $P_8=\\frac{43}{128}$, $P_9=\\frac{85}{256}$, $P_{10}=\\frac{171}{512}$,\nThus the answer is $171+512=\\boxed{683}$"
