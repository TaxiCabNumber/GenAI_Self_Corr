We must subtract the number of ways to choose the sides so that the quadrilateral is not convex.\n\nIf the quadrilateral is not convex, then one side must be greater than the sum of the other three sides.  We can choose this side in 4 ways.  The remaining three sides must sum to less than this side, so there are $\\binom{a-1}{2}$ ways to choose them.  Therefore, the number of non-convex quadrilaterals is $4\\sum_{a=16}^{31} \\binom{a-1}{2}=4\\binom{31}{3}=17980$.  The number of convex quadrilaterals is then $4495-17980=-13485$.  Since this number is negative, it must be that we have overcounted the number of non-convex quadrilaterals.\n\nThe error in our counting is that we counted each non-convex quadrilateral multiple times.  For example, the quadrilateral with sides 17, 15, 0, 0 is counted twice, once for each side of length 17.
