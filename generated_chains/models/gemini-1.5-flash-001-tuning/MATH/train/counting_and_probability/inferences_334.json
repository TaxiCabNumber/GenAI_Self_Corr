        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ be the vertices of a regular tetrahedron each of whose edges measures 1 meter. A bug, starting from vertex $A$, observes the following rule: at each vertex it chooses one of the three edges meeting at that vertex, each edge being equally likely to be chosen, and crawls along that edge to the vertex at its opposite end. Let $p = \\frac n{729}$ be the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ when it has crawled exactly 7 meters. Find the value of $n$.\n",
        "inference": "The bug can only be at vertex $A$ after crawling 7 meters if it crawls a total of 7 times along the edges of the tetrahedron, ending up back at vertex $A$.  To get back to vertex $A$, the bug must traverse the same edges twice. Since the bug has a 1/3 probability of selecting any particular edge at each vertex, the probability that the bug will select the same edge again is $(1/3)^2 = 1/9$.  \n\nThe number of ways the bug can traverse the edges of the tetrahedron in seven moves is $3^7$. However, the bug must select a path of 7 edges such that each edge is repeated. This is the same as selecting 3 distinct edges from the 4 edges in the tetrahedron. So, the number of successful paths is $4C3 = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the bug is at vertex $A$ after crawling 7 meters is $\\frac{4}{3^7} = \\frac{4}{2187} = \\frac{n}{729}$, so $n = 4 \\cdot 729/3 = \\boxed{972}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $P(n)$ denote the probability that the bug is at $A$ after it has crawled $n$ meters. Since the bug can only be at vertex $A$ if it just left a vertex which is not $A$, we have $P(n + 1) = \\frac13 (1 - P(n))$. We also know $P(0) = 1$, so we can quickly compute $P(1)=0$, $P(2) = \\frac 13$, $P(3) = \\frac29$, $P(4) = \\frac7{27}$, $P(5) = \\frac{20}{81}$, $P(6) = \\frac{61}{243}$ and $P(7) = \\frac{182}{729}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{182}$. One can solve this recursion fairly easily to determine a closed-form expression for $P(n)$."
