I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the dark square in an array of unit squares, part of which is shown. The first ring of squares around this center square contains 8 unit squares. The second ring contains 16 unit squares. If we continue this process, then what is the number of unit squares in the $100^{th}$ ring?\n\n[asy]\nfill((2,2)--(7,2)--(7,7)--(2,7)--cycle,gray(0.8));\nfill((3,3)--(6,3)--(6,6)--(3,6)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill((4,4)--(4,5)--(5,5)--(5,4)--cycle,black);\nfor (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {\ndraw((0,i)--(9,i));\ndraw((i,0)--(i,9));\n}\n[/asy]",

        "ground_truth": "The $n^{th}$ ring can be partitioned into four rectangles: two containing $2n+1$ unit squares and two containing $2n-1$ unit squares. So there are $$2(2n+1)+2(2n-1) = 8n$$ unit squares in the $n^{th}$ ring. Thus, the $100^{th}$ ring has $8 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{800}$ unit squares."
