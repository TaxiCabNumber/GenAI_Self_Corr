The number $s/r$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$\n",

Similarily, there are ${9\\choose 2}$ ways to pick the vertical sides, giving us $r = 1296$ rectangles.\nFor $s$, there are $8^2$ unit squares, $7^2$ of the $2\\times2$ squares, and so on until $1^2$ of the $8\\times 8$ squares.
