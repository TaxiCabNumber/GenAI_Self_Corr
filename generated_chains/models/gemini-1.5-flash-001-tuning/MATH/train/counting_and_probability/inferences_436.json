At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain cross country meet between 2 teams of 5 runners each, a runner who finishes in the $n$th position contributes $n$ to his teams score. The team with the lower score wins. If there are no ties among the runners, how many different winning scores are possible?\n(A) 10 (B) 13 (C) 27 (D) 120 (E) 126\n",
        "inference": "The minimum score a team can have is $1+2+3+4+5=15$, because they have to have the lowest five positions. \nThe maximum score a team can have is $6+7+8+9+10=40$, because they have to have the highest five positions. \nThere are 26 possible scores. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The scores of all ten runners must sum to $55$. So a winning score is anything between $1+2+3+4+5=15$ and $\\lfloor\\tfrac{55}{2}\\rfloor=27$ inclusive. It is easy to check that this range is covered by considering $1+2+3+4+x$, $1+2+3+x+10$ and $1+2+x+9+10$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$."
