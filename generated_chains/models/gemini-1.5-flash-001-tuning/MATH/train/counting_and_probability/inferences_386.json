        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",
        "inference": "For card number 131 to retain its original position, it must be taken from pile $B$ on the first draw. This means that card number 130 must be taken from pile $A$ on the second draw.  This pattern continues, with cards numbered 129, 128, $\\dots$, 131 being taken from pile $B$ on odd draws and cards numbered 128, 127, $\\dots$, 130 being taken from pile $A$ on even draws.\n\nSince we want the smallest possible stack where this is possible, let $2n = 131$. This means $n = \\frac{131}{2}$.  But $n$ must be an integer, so the smallest stack where card 131 retains its original position has $2n = 2(131) = \\boxed{262}$ cards. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$."

        "inference": "The error is in assuming that the cards must be drawn in pairs. The problem does not state that the cards are drawn in pairs.  Instead, it states that card 131 needs to be taken from pile B on the first draw. This means that the stack should be large enough to accommodate 130 cards in pile A before card 131 is drawn from pile B. \n\nTherefore, the smallest stack where card 131 retains its original position has **131** cards. \\\\boxed{131} \n",
