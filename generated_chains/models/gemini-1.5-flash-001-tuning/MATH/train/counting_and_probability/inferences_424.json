Each person may be a member of any number of $5$-player teams, but no two teams may have exactly the same $5$ members. The site statistics show a curious fact: The average, over all subsets of size $9$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $9$ people is equal to the reciprocal of the average, over all subsets of size $8$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $8$ people. How many values $n$, $9\\leq n\\leq 2017$, can be the number of participants?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 477 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 482 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 487 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 557 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 562$\n",
        "inference": "Let $k$ be the number of teams.  For any set of 9 people, the number of teams whose members are all in that set of 9 is $\\binom{9}{5}$.  Thus, the average number of teams in a set of 9 people is\n\\[\\frac{k \\binom{9}{5}}{\\binom{n}{9}}.\\]Similarly, the average number of teams in a set of 8 people is\n\\[\\frac{k \\binom{8}{5}}{\\binom{n}{8}}.\\]The problem states that these two averages are reciprocals of each other, so\n\\[\\frac{k \\binom{9}{5}}{\\binom{n}{9}} = \\frac{\\binom{n}{8}}{k \\binom{8}{5}}.\\]This simplifies to\n\\[k^2 = \\frac{\\binom{n}{9} \\binom{n}{8}}{\\binom{9}{5} \\binom{8}{5}} = \\frac{n!}{9! (n - 9)!} \\cdot \\frac{n!}{8! (n - 8)!} \\cdot \\frac{5! 3!}{9! 4!} \\cdot \\frac{5! 3!}{8! 4!} = \\frac{n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)}{288}.\\]Since $k$ is an integer, $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ must be divisible by $288 = 2^5 \\cdot 3^2$.\n\nNote that $n$, $n - 1$, $n - 2$, $n - 3$, $n - 4$, $n - 5$, $n - 6$, and $n - 7$ are consecutive integers, so at least one of them is divisible by 8, and at least one of them is divisible by 9.  Furthermore, at least one of the remaining six numbers is divisible by 2, and at least one of the remaining five numbers is divisible by 3.  Thus, $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is divisible by $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 288$.\n\nConversely, if $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is divisible by 288, then we can find an integer $k$ such that\n\\[k^2 = \\frac{n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)}{288},\\]and then we can construct a valid set of teams as follows.  Let $S$ be a set of $n$ people.  Let $T_1$, $T_2$, $\\dots$, $T_k$ be the $k$ teams.  We can choose the members of $T_1$ to be any 5 people in $S$.  Then we can choose the members of $T_2$ to be any 5 people in $S$ that are not already in $T_1$, and so on.\n\nThus, the number of possible values of $n$ is the number of values of $n$ between 9 and 2017 such that $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is divisible by 288.  This is equivalent to the number of values of $n$ between 9 and 2017 such that $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is divisible by 8 and by 9.\n\nSince $n$, $n - 1$, $n - 2$, $n - 3$, $n - 4$, $n - 5$, $n - 6$, and $n - 7$ are consecutive integers, $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is always divisible by 8.  Also, $n (n - 1) (n - 2) (n - 3) (n - 4) (n - 5) (n - 6) (n - 7)$ is divisible by 9 if and only if $n$ is divisible by 3 or $n - 1$ is divisible by 3.  Thus, the possible values of $n$ are 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, $\\dots$, 2016, 2017.
