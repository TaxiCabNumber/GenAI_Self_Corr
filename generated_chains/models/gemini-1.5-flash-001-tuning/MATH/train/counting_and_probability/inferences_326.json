        "inference": "A product is a perfect square if and only if each prime factor appears an even number of times.  Consider a prime $p$ other than 2.  The probability that a single roll is divisible by $p$ is $\\frac{1}{p}$.  The probability that a single roll is not divisible by $p$ is $\\frac{p-1}{p}$.  To make the product divisible by $p^2$, we must have either an even number of rolls divisible by $p$, or an odd number of rolls divisible by $p$.  The probability of an even number of rolls divisible by $p$ is\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^4 + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^4,\\]and the probability of an odd number of rolls divisible by $p$ is\n\\[4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right) + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^3.\\]Adding these, we get\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^4 + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^4 + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right) + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p - 1}{p} \\right)^3 = 1.\\]Thus, the probability that the product is divisible by $p^2$ is 1.\n\nNow, consider the prime 2.  The probability that a single roll is even is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability that a single roll is odd is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  The probability that we have an even number of even rolls is\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^4 + 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^4 = \\frac{11}{16}.\\]Hence, the probability that the product is a perfect square is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Notice that, other than the number 5, the remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are only divisible by 2 and/or 3. We can do some cases on the number of 5's rolled (note that there are $6^4 = 1296$ outcomes).\nCase 1 (easy): Four 5's are rolled. This has probability $\\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.\nCase 2: Two 5's are rolled.\nCase 3: No 5's are rolled.\nTo find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \\ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.\nTo find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \\ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3. Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$.\nComputing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$. Thus for Case 3, there are 157 outcomes. For case 2, we multiply by $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ to distribute the two 5's among four rolls. Thus the probability is\n\\[\\frac{1 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 157}{6^4} = \\frac{200}{6^4} = \\frac{25}{162} \\implies m+n = \\boxed{187}.\\]"
