At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSheila has been invited to a picnic tomorrow.  The picnic will occur, rain or shine.  If it rains, there is a $20\\%$ probability that Sheila will decide to go, but if it is sunny, there is an $80\\%$ probability that Sheila will decide to go.  The forecast for tomorrow states that there is a $40\\%$ chance of rain.  What is the probability that Sheila will attend the picnic? Express your answer as a percent.",
