At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 30 students in Mrs. Taylor's kindergarten class.  If there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, 6 students with blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students with neither blond hair nor blue eyes, how many students have blue eyes?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the number of students with blue eyes.\n\nSince there are twice as many students with blond hair as with blue eyes, there are $2x$ students with blond hair.\n\nWe know 6 students have both blond hair and blue eyes, and 3 students have neither.  Therefore, there are $30-6-3=21$ students who have either blond hair or blue eyes, but not both.\n\nSince $x$ students have blue eyes and $2x$ students have blond hair, and 6 students have both, we can set up the equation:\n\n$x + 2x - 6 = 21$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$3x - 6 = 21$\n\nAdding 6 to both sides, we get:\n\n$3x = 27$\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\n$x = 9$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$.

Since the number of blue-eyed blond students is $6$, the number of blue-eyed non-blond students is $x - 6$, while the number of blond non-blue-eyed students is $2x - 6$.  Since the number of non-blue-eyed non-blond students is $3$, we can add up these four exclusive categories (blond blue-eyed, blond non-blue-eyed, etc.) to sum to 30 students in the class.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Blue eyes\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"Blond hair\", (80,74));\nlabel(\"Neither: 3\", (44,10));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$6$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$x-6$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$2x-6$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nSo $(x - 6) + (2x - 6) + 6 + 3 = 30$ and $x = \\boxed{11}$, which is the number of blue-eyed students."
