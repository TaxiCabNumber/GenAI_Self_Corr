At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJane and her brother each spin this spinner once. The spinner has five congruent sectors. If the non-negative difference of their numbers is less than 3, Jane wins. Otherwise, her brother wins. What is the probability that Jane wins? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nsize(101);\ndraw(scale(2)*unitcircle);\nfor(int i = 0; i<5; ++i)\n{\ndraw((0,0)--2dir(90+i/5*360));\nlabel(string(i+1),1.3dir(45-i/5*360));\n}\ndraw((0,0)--1.5dir(75),EndArrow(4));\n[/asy]",
