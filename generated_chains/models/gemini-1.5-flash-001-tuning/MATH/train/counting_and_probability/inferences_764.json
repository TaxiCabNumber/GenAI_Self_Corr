At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers $n$ satisfy the condition $100 < n < 200$ and the condition $n$ has the same remainder whether it is divided by $6$ or by $8$?",
        "inference": "If $n$ has the same remainder when divided by 6 and 8, then $n$ has the same remainder when divided by the least common multiple of 6 and 8, which is 24. \n\nThe smallest such integer greater than 100 is 108, and the largest such integer less than 200 is 192.  The integers between 108 and 192 that are multiples of 24 are 108, 132, 156, 180, and 192, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$ integers. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $n$ has the same remainder whether divided by 6 or by 8, we can write that $n = 6a + r = 8b + r$, where $0\\leq r \\leq 5$.  This implies that $3a = 4b$, and so $a$ is a multiple of 4 and we can write $a = 4k$ for some integer $k$.  Since $100<n<200$, we see that $95<6a<200$, or $\\frac{95}{24} < k <\\frac{200}{24}$.  Since $k$ is an integer, $4\\leq k \\leq 8$.  If $k = 4$, then we must have $r = 5$.  Otherwise, $r = 0,1,2,3,4,5$ are all allowable.  Thus we have a total of $\\boxed{25}$ possible values for $n$."
