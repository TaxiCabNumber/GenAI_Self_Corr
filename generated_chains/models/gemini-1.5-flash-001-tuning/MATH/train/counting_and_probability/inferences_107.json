At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRyan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, and then randomly turns 3 of them on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on?",

        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose where the red lamps go, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which lamps are on. If the left lamp is blue and off, and the right lamp is red and on, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are red, and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are on.
