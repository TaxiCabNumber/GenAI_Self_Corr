At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNathan will roll two six-sided dice. What is the probability that he will roll a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
