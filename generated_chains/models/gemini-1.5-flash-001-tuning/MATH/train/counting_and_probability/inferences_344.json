I hope it is correct.'\nA drawer contains a mixture of red socks and blue socks, at most $1991$ in all. It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?\n",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the number of red socks and $b$ be the number of blue socks.  We are given that $r + b \\le 1991.$  The probability that two randomly selected socks are both red is $\\frac{r}{r + b} \\cdot \\frac{r - 1}{r + b - 1},$ and the probability that two randomly selected socks are both blue is $\\frac{b}{r + b} \\cdot \\frac{b - 1}{r + b - 1}.$  Thus,\n\\[\\frac{r(r - 1) + b(b - 1)}{(r + b)(r + b - 1)} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]This simplifies to $2r^2 - 2r + 2b^2 - 2b = r^2 + 2rb + b^2 - r - b,$ or\n\\[r^2 - 2rb + b^2 - r - b = 0.\\]This factors as $(r - b)(r - b - 1) = 0,$ so $r = b$ or $r = b + 1.$\n\nIf $r = b,$ then $r + b \\le 1991$ implies $r \\le 995.5,$ so $r \\le 995.$\n\nIf $r = b + 1,$ then $r + b \\le 1991$ implies $2b + 1 \\le 1991,$ so $b \\le 995$ and $r \\le 996.$\n\nThus, the largest possible number of red socks is $\\boxed{996}.$",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. Also, let $t=r+b$. The probability $P$ that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by\n\\[\\frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+\\frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=\\frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nSolving the resulting quadratic equation $r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0$, for $r$ in terms of $t$, one obtains that\n\\[r=\\frac{t\\pm\\sqrt{t}}{2}\\, .\\]\nNow, since $r$ and $t$ are positive integers, it must be the case that $t=n^{2}$, with $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Hence, $r=n(n\\pm 1)/2$ would correspond to the general solution. For the present case $t\\leq 1991$, and so one easily finds that $n=44$ is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions.\nIn summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is $r=\\boxed{990}$."
