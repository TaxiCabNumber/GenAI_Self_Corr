We can see that the sum of the first $n$ positive odd integers is $n^2$, so the numbers from 1 to $n^2$ will fill the first $n$ rows.\n\nSince $28^2=784$, and $29^2=841$, we know that the first 28 rows will contain the numbers from 1 to 784, and row 29 will contain the numbers from 785 to 841.  Since 800 is in this range, we know 800 is in row 29.\n\nSince row 29 is a row with 5 entries, we can count the entries in row 29.  800 will be the 17th entry in row 29.

When 799 is divided by 8, its remainder is 7, so 800 will be written in the same column in which the seventh number is written.
