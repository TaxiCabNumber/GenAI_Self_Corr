At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nErika, who is 14 years old, flips a fair coin whose sides are labeled 10 and 20, and then she adds the number on the top of the flipped coin to the number she rolls on a standard die. What is the probability that the sum equals her age in years? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
