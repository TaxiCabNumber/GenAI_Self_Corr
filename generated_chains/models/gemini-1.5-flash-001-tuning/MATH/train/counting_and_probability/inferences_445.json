At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA mother purchases 5 blue plates, 2 red plates, 2 green plates, and 1 orange plate. How many ways are there for her to arrange these plates for dinner around her circular table if she doesn't want the 2 green plates to be adjacent?\n",
        "inference": "Solution: \nFirst, we find the total number of ways to arrange the plates without any restrictions. There are 10 plates in total, so there are 9! ways to arrange them in a line. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, we must divide by 10 to account for rotations. This gives us a total of $\\frac{9!}{10}$ ways to arrange the plates.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the two green plates are adjacent. To do this, we can treat the two green plates as a single unit, which means we now have 9 items to arrange (8 individual plates and the green plate unit).  We can arrange these 9 items in 8! ways, and we can arrange the two green plates within their unit in 2! ways.  Finally, we must divide by 9 to account for rotations, just as before.  \n\nThis gives us a total of $\\frac{8! \\cdot 2!}{9}$ arrangements where the green plates are adjacent.\n\nSubtracting this from our total number of arrangements, we find the number of arrangements where the green plates are not adjacent:\n\n$\\frac{9!}{10} - \\frac{8! \\cdot 2!}{9} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8!}{10} - \\frac{2 \\cdot 8!}{9} = \\frac{81 \\cdot 8! - 20 \\cdot 8!}{90} = \\frac{61 \\cdot 8!}{90}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{61 \\cdot 8!}{90}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$."
