At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn has 6 green marbles and 4 purple marbles. He chooses a marble at random, writes down its color, and then puts the marble back.  He performs this process 5 times. What is the probability that he chooses exactly two green marbles?",
