At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of cards has 52 cards divided into 4 suits, each of which has 13 cards.  Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
