Find the number of arrangements of these six cards where one of the cards can be removed leaving the remaining five cards in either ascending or descending order.\n",
        "inference": "We will count the number of arrangements where removing one card leaves the remaining cards in ascending order, and then double this number to account for the arrangements where the remaining cards are in descending order.\n\nWe can start by considering the cards in ascending order: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$.  If we remove any one card, we will be left with the other five cards in ascending order.

We can build such an arrangement by starting with the cards in ascending order, choosing a card to remove, and then inserting the removed card into one of the five spaces.  There are six ways to choose a card to remove and five ways to insert the card, giving us $6\\cdot 5 = 30$ arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements where removing one card leaves the remaining cards in either ascending or descending order is $2\\cdot 30 = \\boxed{60}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$.

        "ground_truth": "Realize that any sequence that works (ascending) can be reversed for descending, so we can just take the amount of sequences that satisfy the ascending condition and multiply by two.\nIf we choose any of the numbers $1$ through $6$, there are five other spots to put them, so we get $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$. However, we overcount some cases. Take the example of $132456$. We overcount this case because we can remove the $3$ or the $2$. Therefore, any cases with two adjacent numbers swapped is overcounted, so we subtract $5$ cases (namely, $213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, 123465$,) to get $30-5=25$, but we have to add back one more for the original case, $123456$. Therefore, there are $26$ cases. Multiplying by $2$ gives the desired answer, $\\boxed{52}$."
