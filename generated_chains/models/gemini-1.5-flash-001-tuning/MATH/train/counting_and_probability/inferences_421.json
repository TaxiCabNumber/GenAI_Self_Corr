        "inference": "The solution is incorrect because it assumes that if $a_n = 0$, then all subsequent terms must be 0. This is not necessarily true.  Here's a corrected approach:\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences where at least one term is 0. It's easier to count the number of sequences where *none* of the terms are 0, and then subtract from the total number of sequences.\n\n* **Total sequences:** There are 10 choices for each of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$, giving us $10^3 = 1000$ total sequences.\n\n* **Sequences with no zeros:**  For a sequence to have no zeros, each term must be one of the 9 non-zero digits.  This gives us $9^3 = 729$ sequences with no zeros.\n\n* **Sequences with at least one zero:**  Subtracting the sequences with no zeros from the total number of sequences gives us the number of sequences with at least one zero: $1000 - 729 = \\boxed{271}$. \n",
