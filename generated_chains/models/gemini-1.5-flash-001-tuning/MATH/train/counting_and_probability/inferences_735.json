At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob's password consists of a non-negative single-digit number followed by a letter and another non-negative single-digit number (which could be the same as the first one). What is the probability that Bob's password consists of an odd single-digit number followed by a letter and a positive single-digit number?",

        "ground_truth": "The probability that the first non-negative single-digit number in Bob's password is also odd is $\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{1}{2}$ because exactly $5$ out of the $10$ non-negative single-digit numbers are odd. The probability that the following character in Bob's password is a letter is $1$ since it must be a letter according to the prescribed format. Finally, the probability that the last character is a positive single-digit number is $\\frac{9}{10}$ because $0$ is the only non-negative single-digit number that is not positive. Hence the desired probability is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1\\cdot\\frac{9}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{20}}$ since the choices for the three characters are independent."
