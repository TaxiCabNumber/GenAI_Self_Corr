At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 5 blue chips, 4 red chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag, and a second chip is drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

If the first chip drawn is red, there is a probability of 8/12 of drawing a chip which isn't red second. And if the first chip is yellow, there is a 9/12 probability of drawing a chip which isn't yellow second.
