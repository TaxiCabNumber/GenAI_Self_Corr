If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.
