At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$, and let $N$ be the number of functions $f$ from set $A$ to set $A$ such that $f(f(x))$ is a constant function.

Then for a given $k$, there are $\\tbinom6k$ ways to choose the elements on the middle tier, and then $k^{6-k}$ ways to draw arrows down from elements on the top tier to elements on the middle tier.\nThus $N=7\\cdot\\sum_{k=1}^6\\tbinom6k\\cdot k^{6-k}=7399$, giving the answer $\\boxed{399}$."
