At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree marbles are randomly selected, without replacement, from a bag containing two red, two blue and two green marbles. What is the probability that one marble of each color is selected? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 marbles out of 6.  To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one marble of each color.  There are 2 ways we could choose a red marble, 2 ways to choose a blue, and 2 ways to choose a green, making a total of $2\\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ ways to choose one marble of each color.
