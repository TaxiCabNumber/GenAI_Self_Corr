At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMolly flips a fair coin five times, and she is very surprised to flip a head each time. What is the probability she will flip a tail on her next flip of the coin? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

In other words, the coin cannot respond in any way to how it landed on the previous 5 flips. It is still equally likely to be heads or tails on its next flip, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
