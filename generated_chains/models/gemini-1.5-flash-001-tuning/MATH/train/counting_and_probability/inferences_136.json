At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix green balls and four red balls are in a bag.  A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?",
