        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy soccer team has 16 players.  I have to choose a starting lineup of a goalie and 10 regular players (the regular players are interchangeable).  How many different starting lineups can I choose?",
        "inference": "First, we need to choose a goalie.  There are 16 players, so there are 16 choices for goalie.\n\nNext, we need to choose 10 regular players from the remaining 15 players.  This is a combination problem, since the order we choose the players in doesn't matter.  The number of ways to choose 10 players out of 15 is $\\binom{15}{10} = \\frac{15!}{10!5!} = 3003$.\n\nFinally, to get the total number of lineups, we multiply the number of goalie choices by the number of regular player choices: $16 \\cdot 3003 = 48048$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48048}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 16 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 10 more players from the remaining 15 players, which is the same as choosing a committee. The answer is \\[16\\binom{15}{10}=16\\binom{15}{5}=16\\times\\frac{15\\times 14\\times 13\\times 12\\times 11}{5\\times 4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1}=\\boxed{48,\\!048}.\\]"
