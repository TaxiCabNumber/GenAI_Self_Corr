We need to choose $c$ and $d$ so that $c + d = s$.  There are $s + 1$ ways to do this (for example, if $s = 5$, then we can choose $(c,d)$ to be $(0,5)$, $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,2)$, $(4,1)$, or $(5,0)$).\n\nHowever, if $s = 10$, then we have $s + 1 = 11$ ways to choose $c$ and $d$, but some of these choices are invalid (for example, $(c,d) = (0,10)$ is invalid).  If $s = 10$, then there are $s + 1 - 2 = 9$ valid choices for $c$ and $d$.  This is because the sum of the digits $c$ and $d$ can't exceed 18, since each is a single digit.\n\nTherefore, the total number of balanced integers is $100 \\cdot 9 + \\sum_{s = 1}^9 (s + 1) = 900 + \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} + 9 = \\boxed{945}$.",
