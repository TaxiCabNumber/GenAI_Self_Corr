At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDefine an ordered quadruple of integers $(a, b, c, d)$ as interesting if $1 \\le a<b<c<d \\le 10$, and $a+d>b+c$. How many interesting ordered quadruples are there?\n",
        "inference": "We can count the number of interesting ordered quadruples by considering the possible values of $a$ and $d$.  Since $a < b < c < d$, the smallest possible value for $a$ is 1 and the largest possible value for $d$ is 10.\n\nFor each value of $a$ from 1 to 9, we count the number of possible values of $d$ that make the quadruple interesting.  The inequality $a + d > b + c$ is equivalent to $d - c > b - a$. Since $b > a$, we know that $b - a$ is positive, so $d - c$ must be positive.  Also, since $d > c$, the largest possible value for $d - c$ is $d - (d - 1) = 1$.  So, we must have $d - c = 1$.\n\nFor a given value of $a$, we can choose $c$ to be any of the integers from $a + 1$ to 9, and then $d = c + 1$.  This gives us $9 - a$ choices for $c$, and hence $9 - a$ choices for $d$.\n\nSumming over all possible values of $a$, we get a total of $8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{36}$ interesting ordered quadruples.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$.

        "ground_truth": "Rearranging the inequality we get $d-c > b-a$. Let $e = 11$, then $(a, b-a, c-b, d-c, e-d)$ is a partition of 11 into 5 positive integers or equivalently: $(a-1, b-a-1, c-b-1, d-c-1, e-d-1)$ is a partition of 6 into 5 non-negative integer parts. Via a standard stars and bars argument, the number of ways to partition 6 into 5 non-negative parts is $\\binom{6+4}4 = \\binom{10}4 = 210$. The interesting quadruples correspond to partitions where the second number is less than the fourth. By symmetry, there are as many partitions where the fourth is less than the second. So, if $N$ is the number of partitions where the second element is equal to the fourth, our answer is $(210-N)/2$.\nWe find $N$ as a sum of 4 cases:\ntwo parts equal to zero, $\\binom82 = 28$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to one, $\\binom62 = 15$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to two, $\\binom42 = 6$ ways,\ntwo parts equal to three, $\\binom22 = 1$ way.\nTherefore, $N = 28 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 50$ and our answer is $(210 - 50)/2 = \\boxed{80}$."
