For $n\\geq 4$, the spacy subsets of $S_n$ can be partitioned into two types:  those that contain $n$ and those that do not.  Those that do not contain $n$ are precisely the spacy subsets of $S_{n-1}$.  Those that contain $n$ do not contain either $n-1$ or $n-2$ and are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the spacy subsets of $S_{n-3}$.  It follows that $c_n=c_{n-3}+c_{n-1}$.  Thus the first twelve terms in the sequence $\\left(c_n\\right)$ are $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $9$, $13$, $19$, $28$, $41$, $60$, $88$, $129$, and there are $c_{12}=\\boxed{129}$ spacy subsets of $S_{12}$."
