        "inference": "Let $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers from 0 to 9. Then we have the equation $-a + b - c + d = -9$.  This equation can be rewritten as $d = a - b + c - 9$.  For each choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$ there is exactly one choice of $d$ that works. Thus, there are $10^3 = 1000$ total possible polynomials, and there are 10 possible values for $d$ for each choice of $a$, $b$, and $c$. This means that there are $1000-10=990$ polynomials that do not satisfy the condition.

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it incorrectly assumes there are 10 possible values for *d* for each choice of *a*, *b*, and *c*.
