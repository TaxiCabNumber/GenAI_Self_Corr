At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in PROBLEM if each letter can be used only once and each sequence must begin with L and not end with P?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$60$}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the fourth letter cannot be P. One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting. Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters. We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do. This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$. However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO. Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$.\n\nAlternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.  That leaves 5 letters from which to choose the second and third letters, so we can choose the second and third letters in $5\\times 4 = 20$ ways.  This gives us a total of $5\\times 20 = 100$ sequences of letters."
