        "inference": "We consider cases based on the thousands digit:\n* **Case 1: Thousands digit is 4**\n    * We have 9 choices for the hundreds digit (any digit except 4).\n    * We have 8 choices for the tens digit (any digit except 4 and the hundreds digit).\n    * We have 7 choices for the units digit (any digit except 4, the hundreds digit, and the tens digit).\n    * This gives us $9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 = 504$ numbers.\n* **Case 2: Thousands digit is 5 or 6**\n    * We have 9 choices for the hundreds digit (any digit except the thousands digit).\n    * We have 8 choices for the tens digit (any digit except the thousands digit and the hundreds digit).\n    * We have 7 choices for the units digit (any digit except the thousands digit, the hundreds digit, and the tens digit).\n    * This gives us $2\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 = 1008$ numbers.\n* **Case 3: Thousands digit is 7**\n    * We have 9 choices for the hundreds digit (any digit except 7).\n    * We have 8 choices for the tens digit (any digit except 7 and the hundreds digit).\n    * We have 7 choices for the units digit (any digit except 7, the hundreds digit, and the tens digit).\n    * This gives us $9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7 = 504$ numbers.\n\nTo make the number even, the units digit must be even.  We have 4 choices for the units digit (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), so we must divide each of the cases by 5.  Therefore, the total number of even integers between 4000 and 7000 with four different digits is \n\\[\\frac{504}{5} + \\frac{1008}{5} + \\frac{504}{5} = \\frac{2016}{5} = 403.2.\\]Since we can't have a fractional number of integers, we round down to get $\\boxed{403}$. \n",
