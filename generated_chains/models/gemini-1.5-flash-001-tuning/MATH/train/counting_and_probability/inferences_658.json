        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.  If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
        "inference": "Let $P$ be the probability of drawing a green ball.  Then $1 - P$ is the probability of drawing a purple ball.  Since the expected amount won is 50 cents, we have  \\[2P - 2(1 - P) = 0.5.\\] Solving for $P$, we find $P = \\frac{5}{8}$.  Since the probability of drawing a green ball is $\\frac{5}{8}$, the probability of drawing a purple ball is $\\frac{3}{8}$.  This means that the ratio of green balls to purple balls is 5:3, so $k = \\boxed{3}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 green balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a green ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$. Similarly, the probability that a purple ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$. So the expected value is $$\\frac{5}{5+k}(2)+\\frac{k}{5+k}(-2)=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ gives $20-4k=5+k$, or $15=5k$. Therefore, $\\boxed{k=3}$."
