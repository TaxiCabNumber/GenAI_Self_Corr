        "inference": "A three-digit number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of its hundreds and units digits and its tens digit is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\nFor example, 231 is divisible by 11 because $2+1-3=0$.  Also, 704 is divisible by 11 because $7+4-0=11$.\nWe'll count the number of three-digit numbers that don't have the property.\nIf the difference between the sum of the hundreds and units digits and the tens digit is not 0 or a multiple of 11, then it must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.  We can't have a difference of -1, -2, etc., since the hundreds digit must be greater than or equal to the tens digit.\nLet's count the number of three-digit numbers with difference 1.  This means that the hundreds digit is one more than the tens digit, and the units digit can be any digit.  There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit (1 to 9), and then the other two digits are determined.  Similarly, there are 9 three-digit numbers with difference 2, 9 with difference 3, and so on, up to 9 three-digit numbers with difference 10.  So there are $9 \\cdot 10 = 90$ three-digit numbers that don't have the desired property.\nThere are 900 three-digit numbers, so $900 - 90 = \\boxed{810}$ have the property.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{810}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 81 multiples of 11. Some have digits repeated twice, making 3 permutations.\nOthers that have no repeated digits have 6 permutations, but switching the hundreds and units digits also yield a multiple of 11. Therefore, assign 3 permutations to each multiple.\nThere are now 81*3 = 243 permutations, but we have overcounted*. Some multiples of 11 have a zero, and we must subtract a permutation for each.\nThere are 110, 220, 330 ... 990, yielding 9 extra permutations\nAlso, there are 209, 308, 407...902, yielding 8 more permutations.\nNow, just subtract these 17 from the total (243), getting $\\boxed{226}$."
