What is the probability that she has exactly one pair of socks with the same color?",

We seek combinations that have one pair of socks with the same color and two separate socks with different colors for a total of three colors. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose three colors. From each combination of three colors, there are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose a color for the only pair of socks.  There are 2 socks to choose from for each of the colors that only appear once among the four socks she chooses.
