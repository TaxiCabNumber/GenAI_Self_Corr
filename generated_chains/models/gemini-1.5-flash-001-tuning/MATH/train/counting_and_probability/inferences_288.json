        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that $CD = AD-AC$.  This is incorrect because $AC$ is not a segment of $AD$.  Instead, we should consider the fact that $AC$ and $CD$ are both segments of $AD$, and their lengths add up to $AD$.  Therefore, we have $AC + CD = AD$.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $x = BC$.  Then $AB = 6x$ and $AD = 2x$.  Since $AC$ and $CD$ are segments of $AD$, we have $AC + CD = AD$.  Substituting, we get $AC + CD = 2x$.  Since $AC = AB + BC = 6x + x = 7x$, we have $7x + CD = 2x$.  Solving for $CD$, we get $CD = -5x$.  Since $CD$ is a length, it must be positive.  Therefore, $x$ must be negative.  However, $BC$ is also a length and must be positive, so $x$ must also be positive.  This contradiction means there is no solution, so the probability is $\\boxed{0}$. \n",
