In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit number and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age.

        "inference": "Let $d$ be Dick's present age, and let $n$ be the number of years it takes for their ages to have the described property.  In $n$ years, Jane will be $25+n$ years old, and Dick will be $d+n$ years old.  We are given that $25+n$ and $d+n$ are both two-digit numbers, and that the digits of $25+n$ are the digits of $d+n$ reversed.  Since $25+n$ is a two-digit number, $25+n<100$, so $n<75$.  Also, $d+n$ is a two-digit number, so $d+n<100$.  Since $d$ is greater than $25$, this means $n<75$.  Let the tens digit of $d+n$ be $x$, and let the units digit of $d+n$ be $y$.  Then, $d+n=10x+y$.  Since the digits of $25+n$ are reversed, $25+n=10y+x$.  Subtracting these two equations, we get $d-25=9(x-y)$.  Since $d-25$ is a positive integer, $x-y$ must be a positive integer.  The only possible values of $x-y$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  We can check that for each of these values of $x-y$, there is a unique corresponding value of $d$ and $n$.  For example, if $x-y=1$, then $d-25=9$, so $d=34$ and $n=65$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible ordered pairs $(d,n)$. \n",
