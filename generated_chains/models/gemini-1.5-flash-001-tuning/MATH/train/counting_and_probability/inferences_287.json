At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1188}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$."
