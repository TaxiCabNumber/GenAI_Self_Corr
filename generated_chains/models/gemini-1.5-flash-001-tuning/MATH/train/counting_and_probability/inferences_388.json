At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet set $\\mathcal{A}$ be a 90-element subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\},$ and let $S$ be the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{A}.$ Find the number of possible values of $S.$\n",
        "inference": "Consider the sets $\\{1,100\\}$, $\\{2,99\\}$, $\\{3,98\\}$, $\\dots$, $\\{50,51\\}$.  Each of these sets has a sum of 101.  Since $\\mathcal{A}$ has 90 elements, it must include at least 45 of these pairs, and possibly more.  Thus,\n\\[S \\ge 45 \\cdot 101 = 4545.\\]Furthermore, $S$ is the sum of 90 distinct positive integers, so\n\\[S \\le 90 \\cdot 100 = 9000.\\]We claim that any integer $S$ between 4545 and 9000 inclusive is possible.  To see this, we can construct a set $\\mathcal{A}$ for each such $S$.  For example, if $S = 4600$, then $\\mathcal{A}$ can be\n\\[\\{1,2,3,\\dots, 45, 51, 52, \\dots, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100\\}.\\]If $S = 4700$, then $\\mathcal{A}$ can be\n\\[\\{1,2,3,\\dots, 45, 50, 51, 52, \\dots, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100\\}.\\]In general, if $S = 4545 + k$, where $0 \\le k \\le 4455$, then we can take\n\\[\\{1,2,3,\\dots, 45, 51 - k, 52 - k, \\dots, 96 - k, 97 - k, 98 - k, 99 - k, 100 - k\\}.\\]Thus, there are $9000 - 4545 + 1 = \\boxed{4456}$ possible values of $S$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest $S$ is $1+2+ \\ldots +90 = 91 \\cdot 45 = 4095$. The largest $S$ is $11+12+ \\ldots +100=111\\cdot 45=4995$. All numbers between $4095$ and $4995$ are possible values of S, so the number of possible values of S is $4995-4095+1=901$.\nAlternatively, for ease of calculation, let set $\\mathcal{B}$ be a 10-element subset of $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,100\\}$, and let $T$ be the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. Note that the number of possible $S$ is the number of possible $T=5050-S$. The smallest possible $T$ is $1+2+ \\ldots +10 = 55$ and the largest is $91+92+ \\ldots + 100 = 955$, so the number of possible values of T, and therefore S, is $955-55+1=\\boxed{901}$."
