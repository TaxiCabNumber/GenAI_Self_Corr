At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers 1 through 25 are written on 25 cards with one number on each card. Sara picks one of the 25 cards at random. What is the probability that the number on her card will be a multiple of 2 or 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

So the number of good outcomes is $12+5-2=15$ and the probability is $\\frac{15}{25}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$."
