I hope it is correct.'\nFor a certain weekend, the weatherman predicts that it will rain with a $40\\%$ probability on Saturday and a $50\\%$ probability on Sunday. Assuming these probabilities are independent, what is the probability that it rains over the weekend (that is, on at least one of the days)? Express your answer as a percentage.",
