At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles.  Two marbles are drawn from the bag and not replaced.  What is the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white?",
