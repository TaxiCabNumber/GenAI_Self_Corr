At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach unit square of a 3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For each square, either color is equally likely to be used. The probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red square is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

Then there are $2^5$ ways to color the rest of the squares. $4*32=128$\nFor at least two $2 \\times 2$ squares:\nThere are two cases: those with two red squares on one side and those without red squares on one side.\nThe first case is easy: 4 ways to choose which the side the squares will be on, and $2^3$ ways to color the rest of the squares, so 32 ways to do that. For the second case, there will by only two ways to pick two squares, and $2^2$ ways to color the other squares. $32+8=40$\nFor at least three $2 \\times 2$ squares:\nChoosing three such squares leaves only one square left, with four places to place it.
