At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEight women of different heights are at a party. Each woman decides to only shake hands with women shorter than herself. How many handshakes take place?",

Of course, the shorter of the two will not participate in the handshake because her handshake partner is not shorter than herself.
