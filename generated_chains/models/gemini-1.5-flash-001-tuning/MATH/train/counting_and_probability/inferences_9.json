At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn needs to catch a train. The train arrives randomly some time between 2:00 and 3:00, waits for 20 minutes, and then leaves. If John also arrives randomly between 2:00 and 3:00, what is the probability that the train will be there when John arrives?",

If we divide the axes into 60 units, the shaded region can be split up into a triangle of area $20\\cdot 20/2=200$ square units and a parallelogram of area $20\\cdot 40=800$ square units, and the whole square has an area of 3600 square units. The ratio is $1000/3600=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$."
