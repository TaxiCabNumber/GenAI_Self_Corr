There must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares. A scanning code is called $\\textit{symmetric}$ if its look does not change when the entire square is rotated by a multiple of $90 ^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around its center, nor when it is reflected across a line joining opposite corners or a line joining midpoints of opposite sides. What is the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 510} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 1022} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 8190} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 8192} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 65,534}$\n",
