Or does it mean no traps on the three islands *not* containing treasure? \n\n**Assuming the question means no traps on any of the six islands, including the three with treasure:**\n\nThis means the probability of finding treasure on a single island must *include* the probability of finding no traps. \n\nTherefore, the probability of finding treasure on a single island is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$ (since the probability of finding no traps is $\\frac{2}{3}$).\n\nThe probability of finding treasure on exactly three islands and no traps on any of the six islands is then:\n\n$$\\binom{6}{3} \\left(\\frac{3}{8}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$20 \\cdot \\frac{27}{512} \\cdot \\frac{1}{27} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{128}}$$ \n",
