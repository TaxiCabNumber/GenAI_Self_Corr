At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a drawer with 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife?",

To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of silverware.  There are 6 ways we could choose a fork, 6 ways to choose a spoon, and 6 ways to choose a knife, making a total of $6\\cdot 6 \\cdot 6=216$ ways to choose a fork, a knife, and a spoon so our final probability is $\\frac{216}{816}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{34}}$."
