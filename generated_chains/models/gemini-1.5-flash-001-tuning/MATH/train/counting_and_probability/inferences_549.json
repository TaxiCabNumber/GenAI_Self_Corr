At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $ S $ be the set of all sides and diagonals of a regular pentagon. A pair of elements of $ S $ are selected at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two chosen segments have the same length?",

Picking an element at random will leave 4 elements with the same length as the element picked, with $9$ total elements remaining. Therefore, the probability that the second element has the same length as the first is simply $\\boxed{\\tfrac{4}{9}}.$"
