The midpoint of a segment determined by two points in $S$ will have integer coordinates if and only if the $x$-coordinates, the $y$-coordinates, and the $z$-coordinates of the two points have the same parity.  There are $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 60$ ways to choose a point in $S,$ and then $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$ ways to choose a second point in $S$ with the same parity as the first point.

        "inference": "The error in the solution lies in the calculation of the number of ways to choose two points with the same parity. The solution incorrectly assumes that there are 24 ways to choose a second point with the same parity for each point. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nThere are 3 choices for the parity of each coordinate (even or odd), leading to $3\\cdot3\\cdot3=27$ possible parity combinations.  For each combination, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the $x$-coordinates, $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the $y$-coordinates, and $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose the $z$-coordinates.
