        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits?",
        "inference": "Let the three-digit number be $\\overline{abc}$.  We are given that $b = \\frac{a+c}{2}$.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $2b = a+c$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, the only possible values for $2b$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18.  We can then find the corresponding values of $a$ and $c$ by solving the equation $2b = a+c$.  For example, if $2b = 6$, then $a+c = 6$, and the possible values for $(a,c)$ are $(0,6)$, $(1,5)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,2)$, $(5,1)$, and $(6,0)$.  We can list out the possible values of $(a,b,c)$ and count them.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$."
