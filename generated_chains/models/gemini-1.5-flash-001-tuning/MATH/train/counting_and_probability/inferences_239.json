Think of a square with sides of length one hour, representing the possible arrival times of Alice and Bob.  \n\n* The area of the square represents all possible combinations of arrival times.\n* The area below the diagonal represents the combinations where Bob arrives before Alice. \n\nWe are given that Alice arrives after Bob. This means we are only considering the area below the diagonal. We want to find the probability that Bob arrived before 1:30, which is represented by a triangle with a base of 1/2 hour and a height of one hour.\n\nThe area of the triangle is (1/2)*(1/2)*1 = 1/4. The area of the triangle below the diagonal is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Bob arrived before 1:30, given that Alice arrived after him, is (1/4) / (1/2) = 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.
