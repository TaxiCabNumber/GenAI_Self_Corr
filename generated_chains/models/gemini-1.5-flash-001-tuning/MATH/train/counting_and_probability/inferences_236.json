        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo distinct positive integers from 1 to 50 inclusive are chosen.  Let the sum of the integers equal $S$ and the product equal $P$.  What is the probability that $P+S$ is one less than a multiple of 5?",

        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $\\binom{50}{2}=1225$ ways to choose the two positive integers.  Call these integers $a$ and $b$.  The problem asks what the probability is that: $$ab+a+b=n-1$$where $n$ is a multiple of 5.  We can add one to each side of this equation and factor: $$ab+a+b+1=(a+1)(b+1)=n$$Now, we need to count the number of values of $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+1)(b+1)$ is a multiple of 5.  This will happen if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5, which will mean $a$ or $b$ is one less than a multiple of 5.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 50 inclusive that are 1 less than a multiple of 5: $4,9,14, \\dots, 49$.  So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\\binom{40}{2}=780$.  Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\\frac{445}{1225}=\\boxed{\\frac{89}{245}}$$"
