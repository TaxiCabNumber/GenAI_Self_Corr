I hope it is correct.'\nIn a tournament each player played exactly one game against each of the other players. In each game the winner was awarded $1$ point, the loser got $0$ points, and each of the two players earned $\\frac{1}{2}$ point if the game was a tie. After the completion of the tournament, it was found that exactly half of the points earned by each player were earned against the ten players with the least number of points. (In particular, each of the ten lowest scoring players earned half of her/his points against the other nine of the ten). What was the total number of players in the tournament?\n",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the total number of players in the tournament. Each player plays $n-1$ games, so the total number of games played is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.  Since each game results in one point being awarded, the total number of points awarded is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of points earned by each of the ten players with the least number of points.  Since each of these players earned half their points against the other nine players, each of them earned $\\frac{x}{2}$ points against the other nine.  This means that the total number of points earned by these ten players against each other is $10 \\cdot \\frac{x}{2} = 5x$.\n\nSince each of the ten lowest scoring players earned half their points against the other nine, the other $n-10$ players also earned a total of $5x$ points against the ten lowest scoring players.  Thus, the total number of points earned in games between the ten lowest scoring players and the other $n-10$ players is $10x$.\n\nSince each of the $n-10$ players earned half their points against the ten lowest scoring players, they earned the other half of their points against each other.  The total number of points earned in games between these $n-10$ players is $\\frac{(n-10)(n-11)}{2}$.  Since each of these players earns half their points against the other $n-11$ players, the total number of points earned in these games is $\\frac{(n-10)(n-11)}{4}$.\n\nWe can now set up an equation to represent the total number of points earned in the tournament:\n\n$$\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 5x + 10x + \\frac{(n-10)(n-11)}{4}$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$2n(n-1) = 30x + (n-10)(n-11)$$\n\n$$n^2 - n = 30x + n^2 - 21n + 110$$\n\n$$20n = 30x + 110$$\n\n$$2n = 3x + 11$$\n\nWe know that $x$ is the number of points earned by one of the ten lowest scoring players.  Since each player plays $n-1$ games, the maximum number of points that a player can earn is $n-1$.  Therefore, $x \\le n-1$.  Substituting this inequality into the equation above, we get:\n\n$$2n \\le 3(n-1) + 11$$\n\n$$2n \\le 3n + 8$$\n\n$$-8 \\le n$$\n\nSince $n$ represents the number of players, it must be a positive integer.  The smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is $n=1$.  However, this solution is not valid since there must be at least two players for a tournament to occur.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=2$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$4 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$-7 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = -\\frac{7}{3}$$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=3$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$6 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$-5 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = -\\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=4$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$8 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$-3 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = -1$$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=5$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$10 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$-1 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = -\\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=6$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$12 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$1 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nThis solution is not valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nLet's try the next possible value of $n$, which is $n=7$.  Substituting this into the equation $2n = 3x + 11$, we get:\n\n$$14 = 3x + 11$$\n\n$$3 = 3x$$\n\n$$x = 1$$\n\nThis solution is valid because the number of points earned by a player must be a non-negative integer.\n\nTherefore, the total number of players in the tournament is $\\boxed{7}$.  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us suppose for convenience that there were $n + 10$ players overall. Among the $n$ players not in the weakest 10 there were $n \\choose 2$ games played and thus $n \\choose 2$ points earned. By the givens, this means that these $n$ players also earned $n \\choose 2$ points against our weakest 10. Now, the 10 weakest players playing amongst themselves played ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$ games and so earned 45 points playing each other. Then they also earned 45 points playing against the stronger $n$ players. Since every point earned falls into one of these categories, It follows that the total number of points earned was $2{n \\choose 2} + 90 = n^2 - n + 90$. However, there was one point earned per game, and there were a total of ${n + 10 \\choose 2} = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ games played and thus $\\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ points earned. So we have $n^2 -n + 90 = \\frac{(n + 10)(n + 9)}{2}$ so $2n^2 - 2n + 180 = n^2 + 19n + 90$ and $n^2 -21n + 90 = 0$ and $n = 6$ or $n = 15$. Now, note that the top $n$ players got $n(n - 1)$ points in total (by our previous calculation) for an average of $n - 1$, while the bottom 10 got 90 points total, for an average of 9. Thus we must have $n > 10$, so $n = 15$ and the answer is $15 + 10 = \\boxed{25}$."
