I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a certain biased coin is flipped five times, the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$ and is the same as that of getting heads exactly twice. Let $\\frac ij$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the coin comes up heads in exactly $3$ out of $5$ flips. Find $i+j$.\n",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of getting heads on a single flip.  The probability of getting exactly one head in five flips is $5p(1-p)^4$, and the probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips is $10p^2(1-p)^3$.  Setting these equal, we have \\[5p(1-p)^4=10p^2(1-p)^3.\\] Since the probability of getting heads exactly once is not equal to $0$, we can divide both sides by $5p(1-p)^3$, to get $1-p = 2p$.

        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that the probability of getting exactly one head is equal to the probability of getting exactly two heads. This is not necessarily true. \n\nThe solution should focus on finding the probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips, given that the probability of getting one head is equal to the probability of getting two heads. We don't need to solve for the probability of getting heads in a single flip.\n\n**Corrected solution:**\n\nLet's denote the probability of getting heads in a single flip as $p$.  We are given that the probability of getting exactly one head in five flips is equal to the probability of getting exactly two heads in five flips. This can be written as:\n\n$$5p(1-p)^4 = 10p^2(1-p)^3$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$1-p = 2p$$\n\nSolving for $p$, we find $p = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nNow, the probability of getting exactly three heads in five flips is:\n\n$$10 \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{40}{243}$$\n\nTherefore, $i+j = 40 + 243 = \\boxed{283}$. \n",
