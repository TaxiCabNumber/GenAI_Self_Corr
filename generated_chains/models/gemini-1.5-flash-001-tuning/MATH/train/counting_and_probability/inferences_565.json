At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMatt will arrange four identical, dotless dominoes (shaded 1 by 2 rectangles) on the 5 by 4 grid below so that a path is formed from the upper left-hand corner $A$ to the lower righthand corner $B$. In a path, consecutive dominoes must touch at their sides and not just their corners. No domino may be placed diagonally; each domino covers exactly two of the unit squares shown on the grid. One arrangement is shown. How many distinct arrangements are possible, including the one shown?\n\n[asy]\nsize(101);\nreal w = 1; picture q;\nfilldraw(q,(1/10,0)--(19/10,0)..(2,1/10)--(2,9/10)..(19/10,1)--(1/10,1)..(0,9/10)--(0,1/10)..cycle,gray(.6),linewidth(.6));\nadd(shift(4*up)*q); add(shift(3*up)*shift(3*right)*rotate(90)*q); add(shift(1*up)*shift(3*right)*rotate(90)*q); add(shift(4*right)*rotate(90)*q);\npair A = (0,5); pair B = (4,0);\nfor(int i = 0; i<5; ++i)\n{draw((i,0)--(A+(i,0))); draw((0,i)--(B+(0,i)));}\ndraw(A--(A+B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW,fontsize(8pt)); label(\"$B$\",B,SE,fontsize(8pt));\n[/asy]",
