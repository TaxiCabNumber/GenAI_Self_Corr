There are 54 natural numbers between 7 and 59, inclusive.  Of these, 18 are divisible by 3, and 10 are divisible by 5.  However, we have counted the numbers divisible by 15 twice, so we must add back the 3 numbers divisible by 15.

        "ground_truth": "We are interested in how many numbers among $7, 8, 9, \\dots, 59$ are relatively prime to 15.\n\nFirst, we count how many numbers among $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 60$ are relatively prime to 15.  Note that $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$.  Among these 60 numbers, $60/3 = 20$ are multiples of 3, $60/5 = 12$ are multiples of 5, and $60/15 = 4$ are multiples of 15.  We can take 60, and subtract 20 and 12, but we have subtracted the multiples of 15 twice.  Therefore, among the 60 numbers, there are $60 - 20 - 12 + 4 = 32$ numbers that are relatively prime to 15.\n\nGoing back to the set $7, 8, 9, \\dots, 59$, we must account for the numbers 1, 2, and 4 that are relatively prime to 15.  Thus, the answer is $32 - 3 = \\boxed{29}$."
