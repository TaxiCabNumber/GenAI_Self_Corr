At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nInterior numbers begin in the third row of Pascal's Triangle. The sum of the interior numbers in the fourth row is 6. The sum of the interior numbers of the fifth row is 14. What is the sum of the interior numbers of the seventh row?",
        "inference": "The interior numbers of the fourth row are 1, 3, 3, and 1. The sum of these numbers is 8. The interior numbers of the fifth row are 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1. The sum of these numbers is 16. The interior numbers of the seventh row are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, and 1. The sum of these numbers is 64.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{64}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If Pascal's Triangle begins with row 1, then the sum of the elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. The interior numbers refer to all numbers in the row except the $1$ at each end, so the sum of the interior elements in row $n$ is $2^{n-1}-1-1=2^{n-1}-2$. For the fourth row, the sum is $2^3-2=6$. For the fifth row, the sum is $2^4-2=14$. So for the seventh row the sum is $2^{7-1}-2=64-2=\\boxed{62}$."
