At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

That is, if we had 5 distinct digits, there would be $5! = 120$ orderings. However, we must divide by 3! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in that many ways).
