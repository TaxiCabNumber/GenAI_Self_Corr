At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil has 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in a bag. He removes a marble at random, records the color, puts it back, and then repeats this process until he has withdrawn 6 marbles. What is the probability that exactly three of the marbles that he removes are green? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",

There are also  $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones. Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \\cdot \\frac{9261}{1000000}\\approx \\boxed{.185}$."
