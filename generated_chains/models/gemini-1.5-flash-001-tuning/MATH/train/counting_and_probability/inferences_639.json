        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the game Deal or No Deal, participants choose a box at random from a set of $26,$ one containing each of the following values: \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\\hline\\$.01&\\$1,000\\\\\\hline\\$1&\\$5,000\\\\\\hline\\$5&\\$10,000\\\\\\hline\\$10&\\$25,000\\\\\\hline\\$25&\\$50,000\\\\\\hline\\$50&\\$75,000\\\\\\hline\\$75&\\$100,000\\\\\\hline\\$100&\\$200,000\\\\\\hline\\$200&\\$300,000\\\\\\hline\\$300&\\$400,000\\\\\\hline\\$400&\\$500,000\\\\\\hline\\$500&\\$750,000\\\\\\hline\\$750&\\$1,000,000\\\\\\hline\\end{tabular} After choosing a box, participants eliminate other boxes by opening them, showing the amount of money in the box to the crowd, and then removing that box (and its money!) from the game. What is the minimum number of boxes a participant needs to eliminate in order to have a half chance of holding at least $\\$100,\\!000$ as his or her chosen box?",
        "inference": "Solution: We need to eliminate enough boxes so that there is an equal chance of our chosen box having at least $100,000, or less than $100,000. There are 7 boxes with at least $100,000, and 19 boxes with less than $100,000. Thus, we need to eliminate 12 of the boxes with less than $100,000. This leaves us with 7 boxes with at least $100,000 and 7 boxes with less than $100,000. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Seven of the boxes contain at least this amount. If a participant is going to be holding one of these boxes with a probability of $1/2,$ there can be at most $7$ other boxes left. This means that at least $26-7-7=\\boxed{12}$ boxes must be eliminated."
