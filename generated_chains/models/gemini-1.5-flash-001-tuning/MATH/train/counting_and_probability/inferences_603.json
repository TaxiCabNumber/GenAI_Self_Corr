        "inference": "The error is that the solution is counting squares that overlap. To correct it, we need to make sure we count each square only once. Here's a better approach:\n\n* **Squares with side length 5:** There are 4 squares with side length 5 that have at least 5 black squares.\n* **Squares with side length 6:** There are 9 squares with side length 6 that have at least 5 black squares. However, we've already counted the 4 squares with side length 5, so we need to subtract those. This leaves us with 5 new squares.\n* **Squares with side length 7:** There are 16 squares with side length 7 that have at least 5 black squares. However, we've already counted the 9 squares with side length 6, so we need to subtract those.
