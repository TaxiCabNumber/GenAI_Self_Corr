At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\n",

        "ground_truth": "We can use complementary counting, by finding the probability that none of the three knights are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$.\nImagine that the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.\nWe will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction.\nThere are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $21$ places to put $B$, and $20$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot21\\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions.\nWithout restrictions, there are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $23$ places to put $B$, and $24$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot23\\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.\nThus, the desired probability is $1-\\frac{22\\cdot21\\cdot20}{22\\cdot23\\cdot24}=1-\\frac{420}{552}=1-\\frac{35}{46}=\\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\\boxed{57}$."
