At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe probability it will rain on Saturday is $60\\%$, and the probability it will rain on Sunday is $25\\%$. If the probability of rain on a given day is independent of the weather on any other day, what is the probability it will rain on both days, expressed as a percent?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: $\\boxed{15\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that both of two independent events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each event.  Therefore, the probability that it will rain on both days is $(60\\%)(25\\%)=\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{20}$.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator of $3/20$ by $5$, we find that the probability that it will rain on both days is $\\boxed{15}$ percent."
