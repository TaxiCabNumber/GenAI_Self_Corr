At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = 16$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\nWe then divide by the number of ways to arrange the boxes.  There are $2!=2$ ways to arrange the 2 boxes, so there are $\\frac{16}{2} = \\boxed{8}$ ways to arrange 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nNote: This method does not generalize if there are more than 2 boxes."
