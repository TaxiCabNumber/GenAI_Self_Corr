I hope it is correct.'\nAfter a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of gymnasts on each team.  Then, there are $n^2$ handshakes between gymnasts on the same team. Since each gymnast shakes hands with $n-1$ other gymnasts, there are a total of $n(n-1)$ handshakes between gymnasts on different teams. So, the total number of handshakes is $n(n-1)+n^2 = 2n^2-n$.  We are given that this is equal to 281, so $2n^2-n=281$.  Completing the square, we find that $(2n-1)^2=281+1=282$.  Since $282=2\\cdot3\\cdot47$, the smallest possible value of $2n-1$ is $\\sqrt{2\\cdot3\\cdot47}=2\\sqrt{141}$.  Since $12^2=144$, we know that $2n-1$ is less than $2\\cdot12=24$.  The largest perfect square less than 282 is $17^2=289$, so the largest possible value of $2n-1$ is 17.  Hence, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\frac{17+1}{2}=9$.  Since the coach shook hands with all $n=9$ gymnasts on her team, the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is $\\boxed{9}$.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the coach only shakes hands with the gymnasts on her own team. The problem states that the coach shakes hands with *all* the gymnasts. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet $n$ be the number of gymnasts on each team. Since there are two teams, there are a total of $2n$ gymnasts.  The coach shakes hands with all $2n$ gymnasts.  We are told that there are 281 handshakes in total, so $2n+n(n-1)+n^2=281$.  Simplifying, we get $2n^2+n-281=0$.  This factors as $(2n+17)(n-17)=0$, so $n=17$ (since $n$ must be positive).  Therefore, the coach shook hands with $2n=\\boxed{34}$ gymnasts. \n",
