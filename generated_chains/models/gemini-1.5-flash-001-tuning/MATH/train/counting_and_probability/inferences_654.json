At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different  numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. What is the probability that the positive difference between the two numbers is $2$ or greater? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

There are 12 such pairs. \n\nTherefore, there are $21-12=9$ pairs whose difference is at least 2.  The probability is then $\\dfrac{9}{21}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{7}}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The only time the two numbers selected will not have a positive difference which is 2 or greater is when the two numbers are consecutive. There are 6 pairs of consecutive numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ pairs of numbers total. So, the probability that the pair of numbers chosen is not consecutive is $1-\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{15}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$."
