        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Kobish alphabet ($20$ letters, A through T).  Each word in their language is $4$ letters or less, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once. How many words are possible?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{4800}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We consider the opposite; we try to find the number of words that do not contain A, and then subtract it from the total possible number of words. So we have a few cases to consider:\n\n$\\bullet$  One letter words: There is only $1$ one-letter word that contains A, that's A.\n\n$\\bullet$  Two letter words: There are $19\\times19=361$ words that do not contain A. There is a total of $20\\times20=400$ words, so we have $400-361=39$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Three letter words: There are $19\\times19\\times19=6859$ words without A, and there are $20^{3}=8000$ words available. So there are $8000-6859=1141$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Four letter words: Using the same idea as above, we have $20^{4}-19^{4}=29679$ words satisfying the requirement.\n\nSo this gives a total of $1+39+1141+29679=\\boxed{30860}$ words."
