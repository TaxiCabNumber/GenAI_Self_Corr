At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNo two students in Mrs. Vale's 26-student mathematics class have the same two initials. Each student's first name and last name begin with the same letter. If the letter ``Y'' is considered a vowel, what is the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
