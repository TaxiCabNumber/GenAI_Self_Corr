At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe planning committee at school has 10 members. Exactly four of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: $\\boxed{210}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 4 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${10 \\choose 4} = 210$ subcomittees. The number of subcomittees with 0 teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 6 nonteachers, totaling ${6 \\choose 4} = 15$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least 1 teacher is $210 - 15 = \\boxed{195}$."
