        "inference": "\\\\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}} is incorrect. \n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nThe train can arrive at any time between 1:00 and 2:00, which is a 60-minute interval.  It stays for 10 minutes. \n\nAlex can also arrive at any time between 1:00 and 2:00. \n\nTo find the probability that Alex arrives while the train is there, we need to consider the following:\n\n* **Favorable Outcomes:** Alex arriving within the 10-minute window when the train is present.\n* **Total Possible Outcomes:** Alex arriving anytime within the 60-minute interval.\n\nSince both the train and Alex's arrival times are random, we can visualize this with a square where:\n\n* The x-axis represents the train's arrival time (0 to 60 minutes).\n* The y-axis represents Alex's arrival time (0 to 60 minutes).\n\nThe area within the square represents all possible combinations of arrival times.\n\nThe favorable outcomes are represented by a rectangle within the square:\n\n* Its width is the 10 minutes the train is present.\n* Its height is the 60 minutes Alex could arrive.\n\nThe probability of Alex arriving while the train is present is the ratio of the area of the favorable rectangle to the area of the entire square.\n\nProbability = (Area of favorable rectangle) / (Area of square) = (10 minutes * 60 minutes) / (60 minutes * 60 minutes) = **1/6** \n\nTherefore, the probability that the train will be there when Alex arrives is \\\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}. \n",
