At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA set of positive numbers has the triangle property if it has three distinct elements that are the lengths of the sides of a triangle whose area is positive. Consider sets $\\{4, 5, 6, \\ldots, n\\}$ of consecutive positive integers, all of whose ten-element subsets have the triangle property. What is the largest possible value of $n$?\n",

Thus, our answer is $n = \\boxed{253}$."
