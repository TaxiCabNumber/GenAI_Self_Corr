        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $n$ be the number of ordered quadruples $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ of positive odd integers that satisfy $\\sum_{i = 1}^4 x_i = 98.$ Find $\\frac n{100}.$\n",
        "inference": "We can think of the problem as distributing 98 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, where each box must contain an odd number of balls.  We can start by placing 1 ball in each box, leaving 94 balls to distribute.  Now we need to distribute 94 balls into 4 boxes, with no restrictions on the number of balls in each box.\n\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars problem. We have 94 stars (representing the balls) and 3 bars (to separate the boxes).  For example, the arrangement `***|*|***|**...` represents 3 balls in the first box, 1 in the second, 3 in the third, and so on.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\binom{94+3}{3} = \\binom{97}{3}$ ways to distribute the balls, and hence $\\binom{97}{3}$ ways to choose the quadruples.  We have  \\[\n\\binom{97}{3} = \\frac{97\\times 96\\times 95}{3\\times 2} = 97\\times 32\\times 95.\n\\]So, $\\frac{n}{100} = \\frac{97\\times 32\\times 95}{100} = 97\\times 32\\times \\frac{19}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29248}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Define $x_i = 2y_i - 1$. Then $2\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i\\right) - 4 = 98$, so $\\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i = 51$.\nSo we want to find four natural numbers that sum up to 51; we can imagine this as trying to split up 51 on the number line into 4 ranges. This is equivalent to trying to place 3 markers on the numbers 1 through 50; thus the answer is $n = {50\\choose3} = \\frac{50 * 49 * 48}{3 * 2} = 19600$, and $\\frac n{100} = \\boxed{196}$."
