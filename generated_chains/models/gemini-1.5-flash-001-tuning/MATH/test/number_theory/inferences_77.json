        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the first of the six consecutive odd numbers be $2k+1$. The next five consecutive odd numbers are $2k+3$, $2k+5$, $2k+7$, $2k+9$, and $2k+11$. Their sum is $(2k+1)+(2k+3)+(2k+5)+(2k+7)+(2k+9)+(2k+11)=12k+36=12(k+3)$.  Since this is a multiple of 12, the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive odd numbers is $\\boxed{12}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-5$, $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, $2n+3$, and $2n+5$ be six consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-5)+(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)+(2n+5)=12n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $12$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{12}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor."
