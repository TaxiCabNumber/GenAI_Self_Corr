At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCards are numbered from 1 to 100. One card is removed and the values on the other 99 are added. The resulting sum is a multiple of 77. What number was on the card that was removed?",
