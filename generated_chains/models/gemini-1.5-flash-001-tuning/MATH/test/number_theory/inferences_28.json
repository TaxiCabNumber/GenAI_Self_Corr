I hope it is correct.'\nIf the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $1575$, and the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:7$, then what is their greatest common divisor?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nLet $A = 3k$ and $B = 7k$ for some integer $k$.  Then the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $21k$, so $21k = 1575$.  Dividing both sides by 21, we get $k = 75$.  Therefore, $A = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$ and $B = 7 \\cdot 75 = 525$.  The greatest common divisor of 225 and 525 is $\\boxed{75}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:7$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=7k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 7 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $1575k=(3k)(7k),$ which implies $k=1575/21=\\boxed{75}$."
