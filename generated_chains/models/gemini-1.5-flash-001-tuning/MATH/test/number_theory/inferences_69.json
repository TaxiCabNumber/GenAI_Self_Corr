        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the least and the greatest positive four-digit multiples of 4 that can be written each using the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 exactly once?",
        "inference": "The least positive four-digit multiple of 4 is formed by arranging the digits in ascending order, giving us 1234.  Since 1234 is not divisible by 4, we must rearrange the digits to make a number divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.  The only rearrangement of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that results in a number divisible by 4 is 1243.  \n\nThe greatest positive four-digit multiple of 4 is formed by arranging the digits in descending order, giving us 4321.  Since 4321 is not divisible by 4, we must rearrange the digits to make a number divisible by 4.  The only rearrangement of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that results in a number divisible by 4 is 4312.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the least and greatest positive four-digit multiples of 4 that can be written each using the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 exactly once is 1243 + 4312 = 5555. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5555}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The number formed by the last two digits of a multiple of 4 is a multiple of 4. 12, 24, and 32 are the only two-digit multiples of 4 that can be formed using each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once. Therefore, the least four-digit multiple of 4 that can be written is 1324 and the greatest is 4312. Their sum is $1324+4312=\\boxed{5636}$."
