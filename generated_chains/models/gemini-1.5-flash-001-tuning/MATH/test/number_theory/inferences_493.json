At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat percent of the integers from 1 to 100, inclusive, leave remainder 1 when divided by 5?",

        "ground_truth": "The integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 are 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96.  If we subtract 1 from each of these numbers, we get 0, 5, 10, $\\dots$, 95.  If we divide each of these numbers by 5, then we get 0, 1, 2, $\\dots$, 19.  Finally, if we add 1 to each of these numbers, then we get 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20.  Therefore, the number of terms in 1, 6, 11, $\\dots$, 96 is the same as the number of terms in 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 20, which is $\\boxed{20}$.
