At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?",
        "inference": "Let the tens digit be $x$ and the units digit be $y$.  Then the number is $10x+y$, and we are given that $10x+y=2(x+y)$.  Simplifying, we get $8x=y$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are digits, the only possibility is $x=1$ and $y=8$.  Thus, the number is $\\boxed{18}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the tens digit of the two-digit integer be $a$ and let its units digit be $b$.  The equation \\[\n10a+b=2(a+b)\n\\] is given.  Distributing on the right-hand side and subtracting $2a+b$ from both sides gives $8a=b$.  Since $8a>9$ for any digit $a>1$, we have $a=1$, $b=8$, and $10a+b=\\boxed{18}$."
