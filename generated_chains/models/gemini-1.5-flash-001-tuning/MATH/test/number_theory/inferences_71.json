        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number which reads the same forward as backward. If a three-digit palindrome is randomly chosen, what is the probability that it is a multiple of 3?",

        "ground_truth": "A three-digit palindrome must be of the form $1\\Box1, 2\\Box2, \\cdots 9\\Box9$, where $\\Box$ is any digit from 0 to 9. So there are $9\\cdot10=90$ three-digit palindromes. Now we look at which ones are multiples of 3. Recall that a positive integer is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. If we look at $1\\Box1$, we want $1+1+\\Box$ to be a multiple of 3, so $\\Box$ could be 1, 4, or 7. With $2\\Box2$, $2+2+\\Box$ should be a multiple of 3, so $\\Box$ could be 2, 5, or 8. With $3\\Box3$, $\\Box$ could be 0, 3, 6, or 9. The possible $\\Box$ values then repeat, $4\\Box4$ giving 1, 4, or 7, $5\\Box5$ giving 2, 5, or 8, etc. So the number of multiples of 3 is $3\\times (3+3+4)=30$. Since there are 90 three-digit palindromes in all, we get a probability of $\\frac{30}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
