At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive integer $M$ divided by six gives a remainder of three. Another positive integer $N$ divided by six gives a remainder of five. What is the remainder when the sum $M+N$ is divided by six?",
