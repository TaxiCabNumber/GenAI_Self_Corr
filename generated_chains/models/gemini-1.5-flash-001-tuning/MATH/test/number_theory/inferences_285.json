At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecall that an integer $d$ is said to be a divisor of an integer $a$ if $a/d$ is also an integer. For how many integers $a$ between $-200$ and $-1$ inclusive is the product of the divisors of $a$ negative?",

        "ground_truth": "The product of the (positive and negative) divisors of an integer $a$ is negative if $a$ has an odd number of negative divisors. It follows that $-a$ must have an odd number of positive divisors. However, for every positive divisor $d$ of $-a$, then $(-a)/d$ is also a positive divisor of $-a$, so that the positive divisors of $-a$ can be paired up.
