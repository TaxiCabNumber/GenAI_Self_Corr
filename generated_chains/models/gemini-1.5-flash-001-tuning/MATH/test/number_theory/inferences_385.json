At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSome fractions can be expressed as repeating decimals. Given that $\\frac{1}{7}=0.14285714285$..., what is the 9th digit to the right of the decimal in the decimal representation of $\\frac{3}{7}$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since $\\frac17$ repeats every 6 digits, so does $3\\cdot\\frac17=\\frac37$. The 9th digit is therefore the same as the third digit. If we multiply $\\frac17$ by  3, we get $.4285\\ldots$, which has a third digit of $\\boxed{8}$."
