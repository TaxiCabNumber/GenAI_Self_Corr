It's important to understand that the same number can have different representations in different bases.  \n\nThe solution you provided tries to equate the base-6 and base-8 representations of $N$, which is incorrect.  We cannot simply equate them and solve for $N$ this way.\n\nTo find the remainder when $N$ is divided by 210, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert $N$ from base-6 and base-8 to base-10.**\n2. **Find the common value of $N$ in base-10.**\n3. **Divide the base-10 value of $N$ by 210 and find the remainder.**\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. **Base-6 to Base-10:**\n   $N = 5\\cdot6^5 + 3\\cdot6^4 + 1\\cdot6^3 + 3\\cdot6^2 + 4\\cdot6^1 + 0\\cdot6^0 = 6480 + 648 + 216 + 108 + 24 = 7476$\n\n2. **Base-8 to Base-10:**\n   $N = 1\\cdot8^5 + 2\\cdot8^4 + 4\\cdot8^3 + 1\\cdot8^2 + 5\\cdot8^1 + 4\\cdot8^0 = 32768 + 8192 + 2048 + 64 + 40 + 4 = 43116$\n\n3. **Find the Remainder:**\n   Since the base-10 value of $N$ is 7476, we divide 7476 by 210.
