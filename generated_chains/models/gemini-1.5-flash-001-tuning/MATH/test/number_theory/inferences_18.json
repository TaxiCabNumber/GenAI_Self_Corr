At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $a$ is a positive integer for which the least common multiple of $a+1$ and $a-5$ is $10508$. What is $a^2 - 4a + 1$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nFirst, we factor $10508=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot19\\cdot23$.  Since $a+1$ and $a-5$ are consecutive even or odd numbers, they share no common factors other than possibly 2.  Therefore, one of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be divisible by $3\\cdot19=57$, and the other must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot23=184$.  Since $a+1$ is greater than $a-5$, we must have $a+1=184k$ and $a-5=57k$ for some integer $k$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $6=127k$, so $k=\\frac{6}{127}$, which is not an integer.

        "ground_truth": "Notice that $(a+1)(a-5) = a^2 - 4a - 5$, so $a^2 - 4a + 1 = (a+1)(a-5) + 6$.\n\nAlso, we know that by the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ divides $6$: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1-(a-5),a-5)\\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(6,a-5).\n\\end{align*}As $10508$ is even but not divisible by $3$, for the sum of the digits of $10508$ is $1 + 5 + 8 = 14$, it follows that the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be $2$.\n\nFrom the identity $xy = \\text{lcm}\\,(x,y) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(x,y)$ (consider the exponents of the prime numbers in the prime factorization of $x$ and $y$), it follows that \\begin{align*}\n(a+1)(a-5) &= \\text{lcm}\\,(a+1,a-5) \\cdot \\text{gcd}\\,(a+1, a-5) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 10508.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired answer is $2 \\cdot 10508 + 6 = \\boxed{21022}.$\n\nWith a bit more work, we can find that $a = 147$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes both $(a+1)$ and $(a-5)$ must be factors of 10508. However, the problem only states that their product is equal to 10508.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe have  $(a + 1)(a - 5) = 10508$. Expanding the left side gives $a^2 - 4a - 5 = 10508$, or $a^2 - 4a - 10513 = 0$.  This factors as $(a - 103)(a + 102) = 0$, so $a = 103$ or $a = -102$.  The only positive solution is $a = \\boxed{103}$. \n",
