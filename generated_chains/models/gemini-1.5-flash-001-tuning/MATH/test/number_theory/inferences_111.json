At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA three-digit number has the same hundreds, tens and units digit.  The sum of the prime factors of the number is 47. What is the three-digit number?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{777}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We can tell that the three-digit number will be 111 times some number $x$ (resulting in 111, 222,...999), so the prime factors of the three-digit number will contain the prime factors of 111, which has prime factorization $3\\cdot37$. The sum of those two prime factors is 40, which means that $x$ is $47-40=7$. So, our answer is $111\\cdot7=\\boxed{777}$."
