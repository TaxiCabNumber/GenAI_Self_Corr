        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has integer side lengths. One pair of opposite sides is increased by $30\\%$ and the other pair of sides is decreased by $20\\%$. The new side lengths are also integers. What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of the new rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the original side lengths of the rectangle be $x$ and $y$.  After the changes, the side lengths are $1.3x$ and $0.8y$.  Since these are integers, we must have $1.3x = \\frac{13}{10} x$ and $0.8y = \\frac{4}{5}y$ both being integers.  This means $x$ must be divisible by 10 and $y$ must be divisible by 5.  The smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ are then $x = 10$ and $y = 5$, which gives us a new rectangle with side lengths 13 and 4.  The area of this rectangle is $13 \\cdot 4 = 52$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the original side lengths.  The new side lengths are $1.3a=13a/10$ and $0.8b=4b/5$.  Therefore, the smallest possible integer values of $a$ and $b$ are $a=10$ and $b=5$.  The new side lengths are $13$ and $4$, and the area of the new rectangle is $13\\cdot4=\\boxed{52}$ square units."
