        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $A$, $B$, and $C$ represent three distinct digits from 1 to 9 and they satisfy the following equations, what is the value of the sum $A+B+C$? (In the equation below, $AA$ represents a two-digit number both of whose digits are $A$.) $$A+B=C$$$$AA-B=2\\times C$$$$C\\times B=AA+A$$",

        "ground_truth": "We start off by replacing $C$ with $A+B$ and changing the form of the two-digit integer in the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n10A+A-B&=2\\times(A+B)\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n11A-B&=2A+2B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n9A&=3B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=B\n\\end{align*}Now we replace $C$, change the two-digit integer, and then substitute $B$ with $3A$ in the third equation. \\begin{align*}\n(A+B)\\times B&=10A+A+A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(A+3A)\\times3A&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(4A)\\times3A&=12A\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12(A)^2&=12A\n\\end{align*}For $(A)^2$ to equal $A$, $A$ must equal 1. Since $3A=B$, $B=3$. That means $A+B=C=4$. So the sum of the three digits is $1+3+4=\\boxed{8}$."
