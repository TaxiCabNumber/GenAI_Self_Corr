At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest five-digit number with non-zero digits such that the digits add up to 20?",

        "ground_truth": "For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\\boxed{11189}$."
