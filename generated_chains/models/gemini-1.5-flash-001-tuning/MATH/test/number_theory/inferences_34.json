At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice is given the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9.$ She must choose a pair of these digits, with the digits being different, to form a two-digit number. How many of the numbers she can construct will be divisible by $3$?",

        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers."
