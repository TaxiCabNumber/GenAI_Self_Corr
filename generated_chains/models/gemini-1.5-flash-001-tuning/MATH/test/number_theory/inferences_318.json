        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the inverse of a number modulo $n$ is just the same number. This isn't true in general.\n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nWe want to find the inverse of 35 modulo 47. This means we want to find a number $x$ such that $35x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $35 \\equiv -12 \\pmod{47}$, we can instead solve the congruence $-12x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$.  Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get $12x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{47}$.  Since $-1 \\equiv 46 \\pmod{47}$, we have $12x \\equiv 46 \\pmod{47}$.  We can reduce the coefficient of $x$ by dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 and 47 are relatively prime), giving us $6x \\equiv 23 \\pmod{47}$.  We see that $6 \\cdot 8 = 48 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$, so $x = 8 \\cdot 23 \\equiv \\boxed{16} \\pmod{47}$. \n",
