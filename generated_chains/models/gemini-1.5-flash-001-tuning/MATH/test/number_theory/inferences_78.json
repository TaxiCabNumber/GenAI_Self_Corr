At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Thus, $m$ has a single-digit $\\gcd$ with $100$ if and only if $m$ is not a multiple of either $10$ or $25$. Thus, we just need to count integers $m$ between $0$ and $100$ which are not multiples of $10$ or of $25$.\n\nThere are $99$ integers $m$ such that $0<m<100$. These include nine multiples of $10$ ($10,20,30,\\ldots,80,90$) and two more multiples of $25$ ($25$ and $75$; we don't count $50$ because we already counted it). So, that leaves $99-9-2=\\boxed{88}$ integers whose greatest common divisor with $100$ has a single digit."
