        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the statement below, the two blanks can be filled by positive single-digit numbers in such a way that the statement is always true:\n\n$$\\text{If }2x\\equiv y+5\\ (\\bmod\\ 9)\\text{, then }x\\equiv \\underline{\\ \\ \\ }\\,y+\\underline{\\ \\ \\ }\\ (\\bmod\\ 9).$$What is the product of the two digits that go in the blanks?",
        "inference": "Solution:  Since $2x \\equiv y+5 \\pmod{9}$, we can multiply both sides by 5 (which has an inverse modulo 9): $10x \\equiv 5y + 25 \\pmod{9}$.  This simplifies to $x \\equiv 5y + 7 \\pmod{9}$.  Thus, the two digits are 5 and 7, and their product is $5\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{35}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{35}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the congruence $$2x\\equiv y+5\\pmod 9$$by $5$ gives $$10x \\equiv 5y+25\\pmod 9,$$then reducing both sides modulo $9$ gives $$x\\equiv 5y+7\\pmod 9.$$Thus, the product of the blanks is $5\\cdot 7=\\boxed{35}$."
