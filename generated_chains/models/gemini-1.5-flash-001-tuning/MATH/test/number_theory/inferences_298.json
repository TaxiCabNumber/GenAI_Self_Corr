I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular map, $3$ inches on the map equates to $10$ miles in real life. If you know that the real life distance between two buildings on the map is $53.25$ miles, what would the distance between the buildings be (in inches) on the map, expressed as a fraction?",

Cross-multiplying and solving for $d$, we obtain $10d = 159.75 \\Rightarrow d=15.975$ inches.
