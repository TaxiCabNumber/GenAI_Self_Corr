This means $n$ has at most $k$ digits in base 2.  Since $n$ has twice as many digits in base 2 as in base 3, $n$ must have $2k$ digits in base 2.  This means\n\\[3^{k-1} \\le n < 3^k\\]and\n\\[2^{2k-1} \\le n < 2^{2k}.\\]Combining these inequalities, we get\n\\[2^{2k-1} < 3^k.\\]We want to find the largest value of $k$ for which this inequality holds.
