        "ground_truth": "We can start by multiplying both sides of the congruence by $10$ and evaluating both sides modulo $997$: \\begin{align*}\n10\\cdot 100x &\\equiv 10\\cdot 1 \\pmod{997} \\\\\n1000x &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{997} \\\\\n3x &\\equiv 10 \\pmod{997}\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhy multiply by $10$? Well, as the computations above show, the result is to produce a congruence equivalent to the original congruence, but with a much smaller coefficient for $x$.\n\nFrom here, we could repeat the same strategy a couple more times; for example, multiplying both sides by $333$ would give $999x\\equiv 2x$ on the left side, reducing the coefficient of $x$ further. One more such step would reduce the coefficient of $x$ to $1$, giving us the solution.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative way of solving $3x\\equiv 10\\pmod{997}$. We note that we can rewrite this congruence as $3x\\equiv -987\\pmod{997}$ (since $10\\equiv -987\\pmod{997}$). Then $-987$ is a multiple of $3$: specifically, $-987 = 3\\cdot (-329)$, so multiplying both sides by $3^{-1}$ gives $$x \\equiv -329\\pmod{997}.$$ This is the solution set to the original congruence. The unique three-digit positive solution is $$x = -329 + 997 = \\boxed{668}.$$"
