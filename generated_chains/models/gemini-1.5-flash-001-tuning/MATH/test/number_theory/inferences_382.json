At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe UPC code, made up of numbers and dashes, on a video tape is 9-78094-11006-$x$. The digit $x$ is in the $12^{\\mathrm{th}}$ position. Let $n$ be the value obtained by adding the digits in the odd positions, tripling that sum, and then adding the digits in the even positions. A valid UPC code is such that $n$ is divisible by 10. For what value of $x$ will this UPC code be valid?",
