        "inference": "The error lies in the conversion between bases. The smallest four-digit number in base 3 is $3^3=27$, which is correct. However, the largest two-digit number in base 6 is not $6^2-1=35$, but rather $6^2-1=35$ in base 10, which is equivalent to $55$ in base 6.\n\nTherefore, we need to average the numbers $27, 28, 29, \\dots, 55$ in base 10.
