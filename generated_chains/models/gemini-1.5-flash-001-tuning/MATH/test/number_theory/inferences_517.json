        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{49}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time. Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$. Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$. From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon."
