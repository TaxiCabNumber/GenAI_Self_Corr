At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.\n\nNow we prime factorize $7 \\cdot 156 = 7 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\\boxed{25}$."
