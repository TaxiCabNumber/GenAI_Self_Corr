We define the function $f$ such that $f(a)$ is the greatest common divisor of  $3a^2+19a+30$ and $a^2+6a+9$.  Find the maximum possible value of $f(a)- a$.",

The greatest common divisor of these two expressions will be a divisor of their difference, which is \\[\n3(a + 2)(a + 5) - (a + 3)^2 = 2a^2 + 11a + 9 = (2a + 1)(a + 9).\n\\]Since $a$ is a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of $3(a + 2)(a + 5)$ and $(a + 3)^2$ is also a divisor of $(2a + 1)(a + 9).$  To maximize $f(a) - a,$ we should try to maximize $f(a).$  This means we should try to make the greatest common divisor as large as possible.  If $a = 1,$ then the greatest common divisor is 30, and $f(a) - a = 29.$  If $a = 4,$ then the greatest common divisor is 9, and $f(a) - a = 5.$  For any other value of $a,$ the greatest common divisor will be smaller than 9.
