        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEuler discovered that the polynomial $p(n) = n^2 - n + 41$ yields prime numbers for many small positive integer values of $n$. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nWe begin by examining $p(n)$ and $p(n + 1)$:\n\n$$p(n) = n^2 - n + 41$$\n$$p(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2 - (n + 1) + 41 = n^2 + n + 41$$\n\nNotice that the difference between these two expressions is simply $2n$.  Thus, if $p(n)$ and $p(n + 1)$ share a common factor greater than 1, then $2n$ must also share that factor.\n\nLet's test some values of $n$.  For $n = 1$, we have $p(1) = 41$ and $p(2) = 43$, which are both prime.  For $n = 2$, we have $p(2) = 43$ and $p(3) = 47$, which are also both prime.  For $n = 3$, we have $p(3) = 47$ and $p(4) = 53$, which are both prime. \n\nHowever, for $n = 40$, we have $p(40) = 1601$ and $p(41) = 1681$. Since $1681 = 41^2$, both $p(40)$ and $p(41)$ are divisible by 41, and their difference, $2 \\cdot 40 = 80$, is also divisible by 41. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
