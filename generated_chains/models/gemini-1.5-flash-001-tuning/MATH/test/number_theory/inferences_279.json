        "inference": "The error is assuming that the average of the integers from 25 to 63 inclusive is the same as the average of the integers from 25 to 124 inclusive that are also between 8 and 63 inclusive. This is incorrect.\n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\n1. **Find the base 10 representation of the numbers:**\n   - The smallest three-digit number in base 5 is $2\\cdot5^2 + 0\\cdot5^1 + 0\\cdot5^0 = 50$ in base 10.\n   - The largest three-digit number in base 5 is $4\\cdot5^2 + 4\\cdot5^1 + 4\\cdot5^0 = 144$ in base 10.\n   - The smallest two-digit number in base 8 is $1\\cdot8^1 + 0\\cdot8^0 = 8$ in base 10.\n   - The largest two-digit number in base 8 is $7\\cdot8^1 + 7\\cdot8^0 = 63$ in base 10.\n\n2. **Identify the numbers we want to average:**\n   - We want to find the average of the integers from 50 to 144 inclusive that are also between 8 and 63 inclusive.
