It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\\boxed{1}$ such number."
