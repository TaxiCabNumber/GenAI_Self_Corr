The largest power of three less than $1121$ is $3^6 = 729,$ and $1121 - 729 = 392.$  The largest power of three less than $392$ is $3^5 = 243,$ and $392 - 243 = 149.$  The largest power of three less than $149$ is $3^4 = 81,$ and $149 - 81 = 68.$  The largest power of three less than $68$ is $3^3 = 27,$ and $68 - 27 = 41.$  The largest power of three less than $41$ is $3^3 = 27,$ and $41 - 27 = 14.$  The largest power of three less than $14$ is $3^2 = 9,$ and $14 - 9 = 5.$  The largest power of three less than $5$ is $3^1 = 3,$ and $5 - 3 = 2.$  Finally, $2 = 2\\cdot 3^0.$  Therefore,\n\\[1121 = 1\\cdot 3^6 + 1\\cdot 3^5 + 1\\cdot 3^4 + 1\\cdot 3^3 + 1\\cdot 3^2 + 1\\cdot 3^1 + 2\\cdot 3^0 = \\boxed{1111112_3}.\\]",
