At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Then\n\\[44_b \\times 55_b = 3506_b.\\]This means\n\\[(4b + 4)(5b + 5) = 3b^3 + 5b^2 + 6.\\]Expanding, we get $20b^2 + 40b + 20 = 3b^3 + 5b^2 + 6,$ so $3b^3 - 15b^2 - 34b - 14 = 0.$  This factors as $(b - 7)(3b^2 + 6b + 2) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so $b = \\boxed{7}$.

        "ground_truth": "If we are working in base $b$, then we have $(4b+4)(5b+5) - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 = 0$. \\begin{align*}\n0 &= (4b+4)(5b+5) - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\\\\n&= 20(b+1)^2 - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\\\\n&= 20b^2 + 40b + 20 - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\\\\n&= -3b^3 + 15b^2 + 40b + 14\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we must solve the cubic $3b^3 - 15b^2 - 40b - 14 = 0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible positive integer solutions to this equation are 1, 2, 7, and 14. 1 and 2 are invalid bases since the digit 6 is used, so we first try $b=7$. It turns out that $b=7$ is a solution to this cubic. If we divide by $b-7$, we get the quadratic $3b^2 + 6b + 2$, which has no integral solutions. Therefore, in base $\\boxed{7}$, we have $44 \\times 55 = 3506$."
