At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest common divisor of two positive integers less than $100$ is equal to $3$. Their least common multiple is twelve times one of the integers. What is the largest possible sum of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$, with $a>b$.  Since the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is 3, we can write $a = 3x$ and $b = 3y$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers with no common divisors other than 1.  The least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is $3xy$, and we are given that this is equal to $12a$, or $36x$.  Therefore, $xy = 12x$, so $y=12$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are both less than 100, the largest possible value of $x$ is 8.  This gives us $a = 3(8) = 24$ and $b = 3(12) = 36$.  The sum of these two numbers is $24 + 36 = 60$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$. Then, $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$ and, without loss of generality, let $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 12a$. Multiplying the two equations yields that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] \\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = 36a$. Using the identity that $ab = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] \\cdot \\gcd(a,b)$, it follows that $ab = 36a$, and so $b = 36$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$, we know $a$ is divisible by 3.  However, $a$ cannot be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, because if $a$ was divisible by 9, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 9 as well, since 36 is divisible by 9.  This cannot occur since $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$.  Similarly, $a$ cannot be divisible by 2, because if $a$ were divisible by 2, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 2 as well, since 36 is divisible by 2.\n\nIn summary, $a$ is a multiple of 3, but not 9, and $a$ is not divisible by 2.  The largest such number less than 100 is 93.  We can verify that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[93,36] = 1116 = 12 \\cdot 93$, so the largest possible sum of $a + b$ is $36 + 93 = \\boxed{129}$."
