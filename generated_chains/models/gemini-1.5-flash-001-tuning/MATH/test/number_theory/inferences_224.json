At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n>1$ is an integer, the notation $a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}$ means that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $n$. Find the sum of all possible values of $n$ such that both of the following are true: $171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$ and $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$.",
        "inference": "The first congruence implies that $171-80=91$ is a multiple of $n$. The second congruence implies that $468-13=455$ is a multiple of $n$. Thus, $n$ is a common divisor of 91 and 455.  We can find the greatest common divisor of 91 and 455 using the Euclidean Algorithm.  We find that $\\gcd(91,455)=13$, so the possible values of $n$ are 1, 13, 7, and 91.  Their sum is $1+13+7+91=\\boxed{112}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{112}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "As we are told, we want to find all values of $n>1$ such that $n$ divides into $171-80 = 91$ and $n$ also divides into $468 - 13 = 455$. We notice that $455 = 5 \\cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\\{1,7,13,91\\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = \\boxed{111}$."
