        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be $n$, $n+1$, and $n+2$. Their sum is $3n+3$, which must be a perfect cube. We can factor out a 3 to get $3(n+1)$.  In order for this to be a perfect cube, $n+1$ must be a perfect square.  The smallest perfect square greater than 1 is 4, so $n+1=4$, which means $n=3$.  The sum of the three consecutive integers is then $3(3+1)=12$, and the smallest positive perfect cube that is the sum of three consecutive integers is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of three consecutive integers takes the form $(k-1)+(k)+(k+1)=3k$ and hence is a multiple of 3.  Conversely, if a number $n$ is a multiple of 3, then $n/3-1$, $n/3$, and $n/3+1$ are three consecutive integers that sum to give $n$.  Therefore, a number is a sum of three consecutive integers if and only if it is a multiple of 3.  The smallest positive perfect cube that is a multiple of 3 is $3^3=\\boxed{27}$."

You found the smallest perfect cube that's divisible by 3, but that doesn't mean it's the smallest perfect cube that's the sum of three consecutive integers. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nSince $n+1$ must be a perfect square, let's try the smallest perfect squares:\n\n* If $n+1=1$, then $n=0$ and the sum of the three consecutive integers is 3, not a perfect cube.\n* If $n+1=4$, then $n=3$ and the sum of the three consecutive integers is 12, not a perfect cube.\n* If $n+1=9$, then $n=8$ and the sum of the three consecutive integers is 27, a perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive perfect cube that is the sum of three consecutive integers is $\\boxed{27}$. \n",
