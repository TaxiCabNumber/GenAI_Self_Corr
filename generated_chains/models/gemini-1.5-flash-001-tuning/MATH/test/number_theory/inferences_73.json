        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many fractions in the form $\\frac{n}{99}$, with $0<n<99$, are in lowest terms?",
        "inference": "A fraction is in lowest terms if the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.  Therefore, we need to count the numbers between 1 and 98 that are relatively prime to 99.  Since $99=3^2\\cdot11$, a number is relatively prime to 99 if and only if it is not divisible by 3 or 11.  There are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 99, and 9 multiples of 11.  However, we have counted the multiples of 33 twice, so there are $33+9-3=39$ numbers between 1 and 99 that are not relatively prime to 99.  Therefore, there are $99-39=\\boxed{60}$ fractions of the form $\\frac{n}{99}$ that are in lowest terms. Final Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2\\cdot11$. So for $\\frac{n}{99}$ to be in lowest terms, $n$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 11. The possible values of $n$ are from 1 to 98, inclusive, so there are 98 possible values for $n$. We can find the number of multiples of 3 and multiples of 11 and subtract from 98 to get the number of values that aren't divisible by 3 or 11. For multiples of 3, we go from 3 to 96, or $3\\cdot1$ to $3\\cdot32$, so there are 32 multiples of 3 from 1 to 98, inclusive. For multiples of 11, we go from 11 to 88, so there are 8 multiples of 11 from 1 to 98, inclusive. We have to make sure we don't double-count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 11: 33 and 66. So there are $32+8-2=38$ values of $n$ that are divisible by 3 or 11. That means there are $98-38=\\boxed{60}$ values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms."
