        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is four times its width. The perimeter is 100 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let $w$ be the width of the rectangle. Then, the length is $4w$. The perimeter is $2(w+4w)=100$, so $10w=100$ and $w=10$. The length is $4w=40$. The area is $lw=(10)(40)=400$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{400}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$. We are trying to find the area of the rectangle, or $l \\cdot w$, so we need to first find both $l$ and $w$. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 4w \\\\\n2l + 2w &= 100 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe will first solve for $w$ by eliminating $l$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(4w)+2w=100$ or $w=10$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=4(10)=40$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $l \\cdot w = 40 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{400}$ square centimeters."
