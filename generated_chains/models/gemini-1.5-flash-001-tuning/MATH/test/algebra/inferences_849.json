At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $10x^2-x-24$ can be written as $(Ax-8)(Bx+3),$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is $AB + B$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe need to find the values of $A$ and $B$ such that $(Ax-8)(Bx+3) = 10x^2 - x - 24$. Expanding the left side, we get:\n\n$ABx^2 + (3A-8B)x - 24$\n\nMatching coefficients with the right side, we have:\n\n$AB = 10$\n$3A - 8B = -1$\n\nSolving for $A$ in the first equation, we get $A = \\frac{10}{B}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$3\\left(\\frac{10}{B}\\right) - 8B = -1$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $B$, we get:\n\n$30 - 8B^2 = -B$\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n$8B^2 - B - 30 = 0$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$(B-2)(8B+15) = 0$\n\nThis gives us $B = 2$ or $B = -\\frac{15}{8}$. Since $B$ must be an integer, we have $B = 2$.  Substituting this back into the equation $AB = 10$, we get $A = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $AB + B = (5)(2) + 2 = 12$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$.

        "ground_truth": "We see that $10x^2-x-24=(5x-8)(2x+3)$, thus $A = 5$ and $B = 2$. Hence, $AB + B = \\boxed{12}.$"
