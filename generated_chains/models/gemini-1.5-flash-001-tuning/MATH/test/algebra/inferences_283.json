        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ is 88. If we decrease $a$ by 5, we get $N$. If we increase $b$ by 5, we get $N$. If we multiply $c$ by 5, we get $N$. What is the value of $N$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{40}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Translating words into math, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c&=88\\\\\na-5&=N\\\\\nb+5&=N\\\\\n5c&=N\\\\\n\\end{align*} We will express the value of each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $N$ and then substitute these equations into the first given equation to solve for $N$. From the second given equation, we have $a=N+5$. From the third given equation, we have $b=N-5$. From the fourth given equation, we have $c=N/5$. Plugging these equations into the first given equation to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we have $(N+5)+(N-5)+(N/5)=88\\Rightarrow N=\\boxed{40}$."
