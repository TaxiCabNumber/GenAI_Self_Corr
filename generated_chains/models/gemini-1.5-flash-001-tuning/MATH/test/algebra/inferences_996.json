        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the equation by $7xy$ yields $7y + 7x = xy$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$xy - 7x - 7y + 49 = (x - 7)(y - 7) = 49.$$ Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, then $x-7$ is a positive integer factor of $49$. These factors are $1,7,49$, so $x = 8,14,56$, and their sum is $8 + 14 + 56 = \\boxed{78}$."
