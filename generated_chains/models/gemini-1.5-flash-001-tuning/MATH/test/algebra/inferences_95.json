At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has sum 2000.  A new series, obtained by squaring each term of the original series, has sum 16 times the sum of the original series.  The common ratio of the original series is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",
        "inference": "Let the first term of the original series be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$.  Then the sum of the original series is $\\frac{a}{1-r} = 2000$.  The sum of the squared series is $\\frac{a^2}{1-r^2} = 16 \\cdot 2000 = 32000$.  We can write\n\\[\\frac{a^2}{1-r^2} = \\frac{a}{1-r} \\cdot \\frac{a}{1+r} = 32000.\\]Then $\\frac{a}{1+r} = 32000/2000 = 16$.  Solving the system\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a}{1-r} &= 2000, \\\\\n\\frac{a}{1+r} &= 16,\n\\end{align*}we find $r = \\frac{1984}{2016} = \\frac{496}{504} = \\frac{124}{126} = \\frac{62}{63}$.  Thus, $m + n = 62 + 63 = \\boxed{125}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term and $r$ the ratio of the original series, and let $S=2000$.  Then $\\displaystyle{a\\over{1-r}}=S$ and $\\displaystyle{{a^2}\\over{1-r^2}}=16S$.

        "inference": "The solution is correct.  The error in the question is that it asks for the sum of the squared series, but then gives a sum that is 16 times the original sum.  This suggests that the question meant to ask for the sum of the **terms squared**, rather than the sum of the squares of the terms.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{125}$. \n",
