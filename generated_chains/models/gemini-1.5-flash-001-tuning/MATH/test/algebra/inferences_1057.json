        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn audience of $450$ people is seated in an auditorium. Each row contains the same number of seats and each seat in the auditorium is occupied. With three fewer seats per row, and five extra rows, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. How many rows does the auditorium have?",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the number of rows in the auditorium and $s$ be the number of seats in each row.  We are given the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nrs &= 450 \\\\\n(r+5)(s-3) &= 450\n\\end{align*}\n\nExpanding the second equation, we get $rs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450$. Since $rs = 450$, we can substitute to get $-3r + 5s = 15$.  Substituting $s = \\frac{450}{r}$ from the first equation, we get:\n\n$$-3r + 5 \\left(\\frac{450}{r}\\right) = 15.$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $r$, we get $-3r^2 + 2250 = 15r$.  Rearranging, we get $3r^2 + 15r - 2250 = 0$.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get $r^2 + 5r - 750 = 0$.  Factoring, we get $(r+30)(r-25) = 0$.  Since $r$ must be positive, we have $r = \\boxed{25}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{25}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the number of rows, and $s$ be the number of seats per row. It follows that $rs = 450$ and $(r + 5)(s - 3) = 450$. Expanding the second equation, it follows that $rs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450$, and substituting the value of $rs$, it follows that $3r - 5s + 15 = 0$. Substituting $s = \\frac{450}{r}$ into this new equation, we obtain that $$3r - 5 \\cdot \\frac{450}{r}+ 15 = 0 \\Longrightarrow r +5 -\\frac{750}{r} = 0.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $r$ yields the quadratic equation $r^2 + 5r - 750 = 0$, which factors as $(r + 30)(r - 25) = 0$. Thus, $r = \\boxed{25}$."
