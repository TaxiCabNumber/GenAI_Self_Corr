        "inference": "The solution is incorrect. You cannot calculate the common difference by subtracting the first and ninth terms and dividing by the number of terms.  You need to know the common difference between consecutive terms. \n\nLet's assume the sequence is an arithmetic sequence. To find the fifth term, we need the common difference and the first term. Since we have the first and ninth terms, we can find the common difference.\n\nLet $d$ be the common difference. Then the ninth term is equal to the first term plus 8 times the common difference.  We can set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{2}{3} + 8d$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get:\n\n$d = \\frac{\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{2}{3}}{8} = \\frac{1}{60}$\n\nNow that we know the common difference, we can find the fifth term:\n\n$\\frac{2}{3} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}}$ \n",
