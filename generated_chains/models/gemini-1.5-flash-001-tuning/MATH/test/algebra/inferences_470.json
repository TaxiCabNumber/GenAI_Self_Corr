We get an $x$ term when we multiply $(+4)(+ax)$ and when we multiply $(-3x)(+7)$ in the expansion.  So, on the left the $x$ term is $4ax -21x$. Since this term must equal $-41x$, we have $4ax -21x = -41x$, so $a = \\boxed{-5}$.\nWe can check our answer (and check that it is indeed possible to find a solution to this problem) by multiplying out the left when $a=-5$: \\begin{align*}\n(x^2&-3x+4)(2x^2-5x+7)\\\\\n&= x^2(2x^2-5x+7) -3x(2x^2-5x+7) + 4(2x^2-5x+7)\\\\ &=2x^4 -11x^3 +30x^2 -41x +28. \\end{align*}This matches the polynomial given in the problem, so our answer is correct."
