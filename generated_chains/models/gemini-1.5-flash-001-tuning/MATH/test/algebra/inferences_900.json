        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a rectangular coordinate system, the line $3y = x$ intersects the line $2x + 5y = 11$ at point $A$. What is the sum of the coordinates of point $A$?",

        "ground_truth": "If the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x,y)$ then $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the equations of both lines (as $A$ is on both lines). Substituting the first equation into the second gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x+5y &=11\\\\\n6y+5y&= 11\\\\\n11y&= 11\\\\\ny &= 1.\n\\end{align*}So now $x = 3y = 3$, and so the coordinates of point $A$ are $(3,1)$. The sum of these is $3+1 = \\boxed{4}$."
