        "inference": "Let the coordinates of $A$ be $(a, 3a^2-5a-3)$ and the coordinates of $B$ be $(b, 3b^2-5b-3)$.  Since the origin is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, we have  \\[\n\\frac{a+b}{2} = 0\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{3a^2-5a-3 + 3b^2-5b-3}{2} = 0.\n\\] From the first equation, $a=-b$.  Substituting this into the second equation, we get \\[\n3a^2 - 5a - 3 + 3a^2 + 5a - 3 = 0.\n\\] This simplifies to $6a^2 - 6 = 0$, or $a^2 = 1$.  Since $a=-b$, we also have $b^2 = 1$.  Therefore, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is \\[\n\\sqrt{(a-b)^2 + (3a^2-5a-3 - (3b^2-5b-3))^2} = \\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (3a^2-3b^2)^2}.\n\\] Substituting $a^2 = b^2 = 1$, we get \\[\n\\sqrt{(2a)^2 + (3a^2-3b^2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 0} = 2.\n\\] The square of the length of $\\overline{AB}$ is $2^2 = 4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$.
