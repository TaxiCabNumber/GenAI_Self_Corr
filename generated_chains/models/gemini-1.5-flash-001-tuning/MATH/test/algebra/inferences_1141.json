At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nReversing the digits in John's age results in his father's age. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years. If the sum of the digits in each age is 5, what is the number of years in John's father's age?",
        "inference": "Let John's age be $10a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits. Then his father's age is $10b+a$. \n\nThe problem states that the difference between their ages is 27, so we have the equation:\n$(10b + a) - (10a + b) = 27$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$9b - 9a = 27$\n$b - a = 3$\n\nThe problem also states that the sum of the digits in each age is 5, so we have:\n$a + b = 5$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n$b - a = 3$\n$a + b = 5$\n\nSolving for $a$ and $b$, we get:\n$a = 1$\n$b = 4$\n\nTherefore, John's age is $10(1) + 4 = 14$ years old, and his father's age is $10(4) + 1 = 41$ years old.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{41}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t$ and $u$ be the tens and units digits of John's age.  We are told that $t+u=5$ and $10u+t-(10t+u)=27$.  Rewriting the second equation as $9(u-t)=27$ and dividing by 9, we have \\begin{align*}\nt+u&=5 \\\\\nt-u&=3.\n\\end{align*} Summing these equations, we find $2t=8$, which implies $t=4$.  Substituting back into either equation, we find $u=1$, so John's father is $10t+u=\\boxed{41}$ years old."
