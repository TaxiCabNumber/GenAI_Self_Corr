        "inference": "The quadratic equation has one real solution if and only if its discriminant is equal to zero. The discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $b^2 - 4ac$.  In this case, the discriminant is $m^2 - 4(m+n) = m^2 - 4m - 4n$.  Setting this equal to zero, we get $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$.  We want this equation to have a unique solution for $m$.  This means that the quadratic should be a perfect square trinomial.  To make it a perfect square trinomial, we complete the square.  We take half of the coefficient of $m$, square it, and add it to both sides:\n\\begin{align*}\nm^2 - 4m - 4n &= 0 \\\\\nm^2 - 4m + 4 &= 4n + 4 \\\\\n(m - 2)^2 &= 4n + 4.\n\\end{align*}Now, the left-hand side is a perfect square.  For the right-hand side to be a perfect square, $4n + 4$ must be equal to zero.  Solving for $n$, we find $n = \\boxed{-1}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the given quadratic equation has one solution, it follows that its discriminant must be equal to $0$. The discriminant of the given quadratic is given by $m^2 - 4(m+n)$, and setting this equal to zero, we obtain another quadratic equation $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$. Since the value of $m$ is unique, it follows that again, the discriminant of this quadratic must be equal to zero. The discriminant is now $4^2 - 4(-4n) = 16 + 16n = 0$, so it follows that $n = \\boxed{-1}$."
