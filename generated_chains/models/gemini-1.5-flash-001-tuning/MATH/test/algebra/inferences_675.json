At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA population of bacteria is doubling every four hours. At noon there are $600$ bacteria. If this rate continues, how many bacteria will be present at midnight, twelve hours later?",
