At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the smaller of the two numbers?",

We have the system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx + y &= 25\\\\\nx - y &= 11\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAdding the two equations, we get $2x = 36$, so $x = 18$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $18 + y = 25$, so $y = 7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
