At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe two positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ are $k$ and $t$, where $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers and $k > t$. What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$?",

        "ground_truth": "From $x^2-mx+n=0$, we get $k+t=m$ and $kt=n$. Since $n$ is prime, one of $k$ and $t$ is $n$ and the other is 1. $k>t$, so $k=n$ and $t=1$. Then $m=n+1$. $m$ is also prime, so we have two consecutive integers that are prime. Since one of every two consecutive integers is even, and the only even prime is 2, we must have $n=2$ and $m=3$. Therefore, $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k= 3^2+2^3+2^1+1^2=9+8+2+1=\\boxed{20}$."
