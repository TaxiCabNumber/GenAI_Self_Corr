At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 153, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.7. What is the value of $y - x$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{48}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 153 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.7y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.7y+y=153$, or $y=90$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+90=153$ or $x=63$. Thus, $y-x=90-63=\\boxed{27}$."
