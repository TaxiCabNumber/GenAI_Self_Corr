        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of seven consecutive integers is 49. What is the smallest of the seven integers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the smallest of the seven integers.  Then the seven integers are $x$, $x+1$, $x+2$, $x+3$, $x+4$, $x+5$, and $x+6$.  Their sum is $7x+21$, so $7x+21=49$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=\\boxed{4}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the smallest of these consecutive integers be $a-3$, and thus the largest will be $a+3$. The sum of all seven  integers is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, which is $7a = 49$. Thus, $a=7$. The smallest of the seven integers is $a-3=7-3=\\boxed{4}$."
