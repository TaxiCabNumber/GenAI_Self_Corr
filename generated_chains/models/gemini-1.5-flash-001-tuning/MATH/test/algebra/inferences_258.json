At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 40 and their difference is 12. What is their product?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x+y=40$ and $x-y=12$. Adding these two equations, we get $2x=52$, so $x=26$. Substituting this value into either of the original equations, we find that $y=14$. Therefore, the product of the two numbers is $26\\cdot14=364$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{364}$.
