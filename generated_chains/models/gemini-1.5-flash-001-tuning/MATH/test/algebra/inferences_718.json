        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number.  What is the number?",
        "inference": "Let the number be $x$.\n\nWe are given that $3 + \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{7}{x}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x$ gives $3x + 1 = 7$.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives $3x = 6$.\n\nDividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \\dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = \\boxed{2}$."
