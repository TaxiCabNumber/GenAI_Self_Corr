At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball is dropped straight down from a height of 16 feet. If it bounces back each time to a height one-half the height from which it last fell, how far will the ball have traveled when it hits the floor for the sixth time, in feet?",
