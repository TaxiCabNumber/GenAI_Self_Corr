At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year.  How much money will Frederick have when he can collect the money at the age of $18$?  (Assume no money is added to the account besides the interest.)",
