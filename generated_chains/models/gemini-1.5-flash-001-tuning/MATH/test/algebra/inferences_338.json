        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJosh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of miles Mike rode. Then Josh rode $2x$ miles.  Let $t$ be the number of hours Mike rode. Then Josh rode for $2t$ hours.  Since distance equals rate times time, we have the following equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= rt \\\\\n2x &= \\frac{4}{5}r(2t)\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying the second equation, we get $2x = \\frac{8}{5}rt$.  Since $x = rt$, we can substitute to get $2x = \\frac{8}{5}x$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\boxed{0}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$."

        "inference": "The error is in assuming that both riders have the same rate.  The problem states that Josh rides at 4/5 the rate of Mike.  We should not substitute  $x=rt$ into the second equation.\n\nHere is the correct solution:\n\nSince $x = rt$, we can substitute into the second equation to get $2rt = \\frac{4}{5}r(2t)$.  Simplifying, we get $2rt = \\frac{8}{5}rt$.  Since $r$ and $t$ are non-zero (they are rates and times), we can divide both sides by $rt$ to get $2 = \\frac{8}{5}$.  This is a contradiction, so there is no solution.\n\nFinal Answer:  $\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}$. \n",
