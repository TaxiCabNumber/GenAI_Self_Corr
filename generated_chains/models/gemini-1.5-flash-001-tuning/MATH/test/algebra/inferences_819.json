At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe midpoint of a line segment is located at $(3, -2)$. If one of the endpoints is $(1, 6)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
