        "inference": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$.  We are given that $(2n)^2 + (2n+2)^2 + (2n+4)^2 = 12296$.  Expanding, we get $4n^2 + 4n^2 + 8n + 4 + 4n^2 + 16n + 16 = 12296$.  Simplifying, we get $12n^2 + 24n - 12276 = 0$.  Dividing by 12, we get $n^2 + 2n - 1023 = 0$.  Factoring, we get $(n+33)(n-31) = 0$.  Since the numbers are positive, we have $n=31$.  The product of the three numbers is $2(31) \\cdot 2(32) \\cdot 2(33) = 8 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 33$, and dividing by 8, we get $31 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 33$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32736}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the middle number of the three, the other two numbers are $n-2$ and $n+2$. Therefore, the squares are $n^2-4n+4$, $n^2$, and $n^2+4n+4$. Setting the sum of the three squares equal to $12296$, \\begin{align*}\n\\left(n^2-4n+4\\right)+\\left(n^2\\right)+\\left(n^2+4n+4\\right)&=12296\\\\\n3n^2+8&=12296\\\\\n3n^2&=12288\\\\\nn^2&=4096\\\\\nn&=\\pm64\n\\end{align*}Because $n$ is positive, $n$ must be $64$. Therefore, the set of numbers is $62, 64, 66$. The product of those is $261888$. The product divided by 8 is $\\boxed{32736}$."
