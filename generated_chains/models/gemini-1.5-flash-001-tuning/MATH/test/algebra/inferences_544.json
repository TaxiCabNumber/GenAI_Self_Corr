        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlistair Inc. shipped 32 packs of batteries to a retail store. Regular packs contain four batteries each, and super packs contain six batteries. A total of 166 batteries were shipped. How many regular packs were sent?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of regular packs and $y$ be the number of super packs.\n \n We know that $x+y=32$. \n \n We also know that $4x+6y=166$.\n \n Solving for $x$ in the first equation, we get $x=32-y$.\n \n Substituting this into the second equation, we get $4(32-y)+6y=166$.\n \n Simplifying, we get $128-4y+6y=166$.\n \n Combining like terms, we get $2y=38$.\n \n Dividing both sides by 2, we get $y=19$.\n \n Substituting this back into the equation $x=32-y$, we get $x=32-19=13$.\n \n **Final Answer: $\\boxed{13}$.** I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the number of regular packs $r$ and the number of super packs $s$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given:  \\begin{align*}\nr + s &= 32 \\\\\n4r + 6s &= 166 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Multiplying the first equation by six and subtracting the second equation from that yields $(6r - 4r) + (6s - 6s) = (192 - 166)$. Solving for $r$ gives $2r = 26$, or $r = 13$. Thus, $\\boxed{13}$ regular packs were sent."
