        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
        "inference": "The company breaks even or makes a profit when the amount of money it makes is greater than or equal to zero.  So we need to find the smallest value of $x$ for which $x^2-8x-33 \\ge 0$.\n\nFactoring, we get $(x-11)(x+3) \\ge 0$.  This inequality is true when both factors are nonnegative or both factors are nonpositive.  The factors are both nonnegative when $x \\ge 11$ and both nonpositive when $x \\le -3$.  Since the quantity produced must be nonnegative, the smallest quantity at which the company can break even or make a profit is $\\boxed{11}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First we factor $x^2-8x-33$ into $(x-11)(x+3)$. So, $y=0$ at $x=-3$ or $x=11$. The quantity produced must be a positive amount, so that means the company breaks even (making no money) at $x=\\boxed{11}$ and begins to make a profit after that point ($y>0$)."
