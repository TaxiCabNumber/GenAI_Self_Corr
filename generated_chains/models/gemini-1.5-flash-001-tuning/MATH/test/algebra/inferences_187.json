        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe combined weight of three basset hounds is $185$ pounds. The two smaller dogs weigh the same. The difference between the larger weight and the smaller weight is $20$ pounds. How many pounds does the largest dog weigh?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the weight of each of the smaller dogs and $y$ be the weight of the larger dog. We know that $x+x+y=185$, which simplifies to $2x+y=185$. We also know that $y-x=20$.  \n\nSolving for $y$ in the second equation, we get $y=x+20$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $2x+(x+20)=185$.  Combining like terms, we get $3x+20=185$. Subtracting $20$ from both sides, we get $3x=165$. Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $x=55$.  Substituting this value of $x$ into $y=x+20$, we get $y=55+20=75$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the three basset hounds weigh $a$, $a$, and $b$ pounds, where $a < b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2a+b&=185\\\\\nb-a&=20\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, we have $a=b-20$. Substituting this in to the first equation to eliminate $a$, we have $2(b-20)+b=185 \\Rightarrow b=75$. Thus, the largest dog weighs $\\boxed{75}$ pounds."
