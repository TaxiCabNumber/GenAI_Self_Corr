The quadratic $ax^2 + bx +c$  has two real roots. The greater root is $\\sqrt{n}+1$. What is $n$?",
        "inference": "The line of symmetry of the parabola is $x = 1$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is 1.  This means that the vertex is of the form $(1,k)$ for some real number $k$.\n\nSince the parabola passes through $(-1,3)$, the distance from $(-1,3)$ to $(1,k)$ is the same as the distance from $(1,k)$ to $(2,-2)$.  This gives us the equation\n\\[\\sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + (3 - k)^2} = \\sqrt{(2 - 1)^2 + (-2 - k)^2}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[4 + (3 - k)^2 = 1 + (-2 - k)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[4 + 9 - 6k + k^2 = 1 + 4 + 4k + k^2.\\]This simplifies to $10k = 8$, so $k = \\frac{4}{5}$.  Hence, the vertex of the parabola is $\\left( 1, \\frac{4}{5} \\right)$.\n\nSince the parabola passes through $(-1,3)$, we can substitute $x = -1$ and $y = 3$ into the equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ to get\n\\[3 = a - b + c.\\]Similarly, substituting $x = 2$ and $y = -2$, we get\n\\[-2 = 4a + 2b + c.\\]Finally, since the vertex is $\\left( 1, \\frac{4}{5} \\right)$, we get\n\\[\\frac{4}{5} = a + b + c.\\]We now have a system of three equations in three unknowns:\n\\begin{align*}\na - b + c &= 3, \\\\\n4a + 2b + c &= -2, \\\\\na + b + c &= \\frac{4}{5}.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the third equation from the first, we get\n\\[-2b = \\frac{11}{5},\\]so $b = -\\frac{11}{10}$.  Subtracting the third equation from the second, we get\n\\[3a + b = -\\frac{14}{5},\\]so $3a = -\\frac{14}{5} + \\frac{11}{10} = -\\frac{17}{10}$, and $a = -\\frac{17}{30}$.  Substituting into the third equation, we get\n\\[-\\frac{17}{30} - \\frac{11}{10} + c = \\frac{4}{5},\\]so $c = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{17}{30} + \\frac{11}{10} = \\frac{29}{15}$.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola is\n\\[y = -\\frac{17}{30} x^2 - \\frac{11}{10} x + \\frac{29}{15}.\\]The quadratic $-\\frac{17}{30} x^2 - \\frac{11}{10} x + \\frac{29}{15}$ has two real roots.  By the quadratic formula, the roots are\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{11}{10} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left( -\\frac{11}{10} \\right)^2 - 4 \\cdot -\\frac{17}{30} \\cdot \\frac{29}{15}}}{2 \\cdot -\\frac{17}{30}} = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{853}}{-34}.\\]The greater root is $\\frac{11 - \\sqrt{853}}{-34} = \\frac{\\sqrt{853} - 11}{34}$, so $n = \\boxed{853}$.",
