        "inference": "Solution: \nWe know that $(x - y)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2y + 3xy^2 - y^3$. \nWe can rewrite this as $(x - y)^3 = (x^3 - y^3) - 3xy(x - y)$. \nWe know that $x - y = 1$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 7$. \nWe want to find $x^3 - y^3$, so we need to solve for $xy$. \nSquaring the equation $x - y = 1$, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 1$. \nWe can substitute $x^2 + y^2 = 7$ into this equation, giving us $7 - 2xy = 1$. \nSolving for $xy$, we get $xy = 3$. \nSubstituting our known values into the equation $(x - y)^3 = (x^3 - y^3) - 3xy(x - y)$, we get $1^3 = (x^3 - y^3) - 3(3)(1)$. \nSimplifying, we get $1 = (x^3 - y^3) - 9$. \nSolving for $x^3 - y^3$, we get $x^3 - y^3 = \\boxed{10}$.

        "ground_truth": "We have that $7=x^2+y^2=x^2-2xy+y^2+2xy=(x-y)^2+2xy=1+2xy$, therefore $xy=\\frac{7-1}{2}=3$. Since $x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=(x-y)(x^2+y^2+xy)$, we can directly substitute in the numerical values for each algebraic expression. This gives us $x^3-y^3=(1)(7+3)=\\boxed{10}$."
