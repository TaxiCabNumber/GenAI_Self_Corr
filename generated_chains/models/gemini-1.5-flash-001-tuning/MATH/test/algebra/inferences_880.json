At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA point $(x,y)$ on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative is a distance of 6 units from the $x$-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point $(8,3)$. It is a distance $\\sqrt{n}$ from the origin. What is $n$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the point is 6 units from the $x$-axis and has a negative $y$-coordinate, its $y$-coordinate must be $-6$.  So the point is of the form $(x,-6)$.  The distance from $(x,-6)$ to $(8,3)$ is 15, so\n\\[\\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[(x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225.\\]Then $(x - 8)^2 = 144$, so $x - 8 = \\pm 12$.  Since $x$ is negative, $x - 8 = -12$, so $x = -4$.  Therefore, the point is $(-4,-6)$.  The distance from $(-4,-6)$ to the origin is\n\\[\\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{52} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 13} = 2 \\sqrt{13}.\\]Final Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $y=-6$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}&=15 \\\\\nx^2-16x+64+81&=225 \\\\\nx^2-16x-80&=0 \\\\\n(x-20)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x+4=0$ or $x-20=0$, so $x=-4$ or $x=20$. $x=-4$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(-4,-6)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(-6)^2}=\\sqrt{52}$ units from the origin. $n=\\boxed{52}$."
