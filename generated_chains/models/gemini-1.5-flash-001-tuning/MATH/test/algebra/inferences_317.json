At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of five consecutive integers is five. What is the product of the five integers?",

The five integers are $-1$, $0$, $1$, $2$, and $3$, and their product is $(-1)(0)(1)(2)(3) = \\boxed{0}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
