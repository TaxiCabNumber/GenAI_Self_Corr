At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $m$ is a real number and $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots, then what are the possible values of $m$?  Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "For a quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive. The discriminant of $2x^2 + mx + 8$ is $m^2 - 4(2)(8) = m^2 - 64$.  We want $m^2 - 64 > 0$, which factors as $(m - 8)(m + 8) > 0$.  This inequality holds when $m < -8$ or $m > 8$.  In interval notation, the solution is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8) \\cup (8,\\infty)}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8) \\cup (8,\\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (8,\\infty)}$."
