        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a bag with yellow and blue marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. If I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 7:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I added more?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{16}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{4}{3}$. Additionally, after we add blue marbles and remove yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be x+5 and y-3 respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $7:3$, so $\\dfrac{x+5}{y-3}=\\dfrac{7}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $3x=4y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x+5)=7(y-3)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=12$, $x=16$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before more were added, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{16}$."
