At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $3x^2 + 14x + 8$ can be written in the form $(3x + A)(x + B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is the value of $A - B$?",

The integers 2 and 12 satisfy these conditions, since $2 \\cdot 12 = 24$ and $2 + 12 = 14$.  Therefore, $3x^2 + 14x + 8 = (3x + 2)(x + 12)$.  The value of $A - B$ is $2 - 12 = \\boxed{-10}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
