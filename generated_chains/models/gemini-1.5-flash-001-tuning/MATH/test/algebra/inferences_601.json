At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $t$ is greater than $2$ and less than $3.5$. How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition?",

Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $\\boxed{8}$ possible integer values of $t$."
