At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt took Lara five days to read a novel. Each day after the first day, Lara read half as many pages as the day before. If the novel was 248 pages long, how many pages did she read on the first day?",
