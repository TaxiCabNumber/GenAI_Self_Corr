At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the tens digit be $x$ and the units digit be $y$. Then the integer is $10x+y$, and we are given that $xy = \\frac{1}{2}(10x+y)$. Simplifying, we get $2xy = 10x + y$. Rearranging, we have $2xy - 10x - y = 0$. Adding 5 to both sides, we get $2xy - 10x - y + 5 = 5$, which factors as $(2x-1)(y-5) = 5$.  Since $x$ and $y$ are digits, the only possible values for $2x-1$ and $y-5$ are 1 and 5, or -1 and -5. If $2x-1 = 1$, then $x = 1$, and if $y-5 = 5$, then $y = 10$, which is not a digit. If $2x-1 = 5$, then $x = 3$, and if $y-5 = 1$, then $y = 6$. This gives us the integer 36. The other possibility, $2x-1 = -1$ and $y-5 = -5$, would give us $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, which does not form a two-digit number. Therefore, the smallest two-digit positive integer that satisfies the given condition is 36.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
