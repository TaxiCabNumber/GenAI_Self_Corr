I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$.",
        "inference": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(2,3)$, the equation of the parabola can be written in the form \n\\[y = a(x - 2)^2 + 3.\\]Since the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$, we can substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 4$ into this equation to get\n\\[4 = a(4 - 2)^2 + 3.\\]This simplifies to $4 = 4a + 3$, so $a = \\frac{1}{4}$.  Therefore, the equation of the parabola is\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{4}(x - 2)^2 + 3.\\]When $x = 6$,\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{4}(6 - 2)^2 + 3 = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 16 + 3 = 7.\\]Final Answer: $\\boxed{7}$.

In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \\[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\\] so $a=\\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \\[y=\\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \\[y = \\frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\\boxed{7}.\\]"
