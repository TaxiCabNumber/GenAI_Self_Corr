        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe weight of $A$ is $40\\%$ greater than the weight of $B$ but $30\\%$ less than the weight of $C$. What is the ratio of the weight of $B$ to the weight of $C$ expressed as a common fraction?",
        "inference": "Let $B$ weigh $x$ units.\nThen, $A$ weighs $1.4x$ units.\nAlso, $C$ weighs $1.3x$ units.\nHence, the ratio of the weight of $B$ to the weight of $C$ is $\\dfrac{x}{1.3x}$.\nSimplifying, we get $\\dfrac{10}{13}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{10}{13}}$.

        "ground_truth": "We have $A=\\frac{140}{100}B=\\frac{70}{100}C$, or $A=1.4B=.7C$. Now we can solve for the ratio of $B$ to $C$. $$\\frac{B}{C}=\\frac{.7}{1.4}=\\frac{1}{2}$$ The ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac12}$."
