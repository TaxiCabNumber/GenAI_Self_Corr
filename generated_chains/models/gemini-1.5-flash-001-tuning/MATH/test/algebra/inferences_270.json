        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6. Four years ago,  Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In four years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now?",
        "inference": "Let Amy's current age be $A$, Ben's current age be $B$, and Chris's current age be $C$. We know that $\\frac{A+B+C}{3}=6$, so $A+B+C=18$. We also know that $C-4=A$, so $C=A+4$. Finally, we know that $B+4=\\frac{3}{5}(A+4)$. \n\nWe can substitute $C=A+4$ into the first equation to get $A+B+(A+4)=18$, which simplifies to $2A+B=14$. We can also substitute $C=A+4$ into the second equation to get $B+4=\\frac{3}{5}(A+4)$, which simplifies to $5B+20=3A+12$, or $3A-5B=8$. Now we have the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2A+B&=14\\\\\n3A-5B&=8\n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 5, we get $10A+5B=70$. Adding this equation to the second equation, we get $13A=78$, so $A=6$. Substituting this value into the equation $2A+B=14$, we get $12+B=14$, so $B=2$. Finally, substituting $A=6$ into the equation $C=A+4$, we get $C=6+4=10$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
