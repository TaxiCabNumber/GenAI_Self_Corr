        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the absolute value of the difference of the two roots of $ax^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{61}}{3}$, and $a$ is positive, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Let the roots of the quadratic be $r$ and $s$.  We know that $|r-s| = \\frac{\\sqrt{61}}{3}$.  By Vieta's formulas, $r+s = -\\frac{5}{a}$ and $rs = -\\frac{3}{a}$.  Squaring the equation $|r-s| = \\frac{\\sqrt{61}}{3}$, we get $(r-s)^2 = \\frac{61}{9}$.  Expanding, we have $r^2 - 2rs + s^2 = \\frac{61}{9}$.  We can rewrite this as $(r+s)^2 - 4rs = \\frac{61}{9}$.  Substituting in the values of $r+s$ and $rs$, we have $\\left(-\\frac{5}{a}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(-\\frac{3}{a}\\right) = \\frac{61}{9}$.  Simplifying, we get $\\frac{25}{a^2} + \\frac{12}{a} = \\frac{61}{9}$.  Multiplying both sides by $9a^2$, we have $225 + 108a = 61a^2$.  Rearranging, we get $61a^2 - 108a - 225 = 0$.  This factors as $(61a + 45)(a - 5) = 0$.  Since $a$ is positive, $a = \\boxed{5}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
