What are the four integers in increasing order? (place a comma and then a space between each integer)",
        "inference": "Solution:\nLet's analyze the sums to figure out the integers. Notice that the largest sum, 29, is the sum of the two largest integers. Also, the smallest sum, 10, must be the sum of the two smallest integers.\n\nNow, look at the middle sums.  The sum of 19 and 21 is 40.  Notice that this is the same as the sum of the largest two integers plus the sum of the smallest two integers (29 + 10 = 40).  This suggests that the integers in the middle are the sum of the two smallest and the two largest integers.\n\nTherefore, we can write the following equations:\n\n* $a + b = 10$\n* $c + d = 29$\n* $a + d = 19$\n* $b + c = 21$\n\nAdding the second and fourth equations, we get $c + d + b + c = 29 + 21$, which simplifies to $2c + b + d = 50$. Substituting $b + d = 21$ from the fourth equation, we get $2c + 21 = 50$, so $c = 14.5$. Since $c$ must be an integer, this is a contradiction.

        "inference": "You're absolutely right! There's a fundamental flaw in the logic presented.  Let's break down why the solution is incorrect and then find the correct answer.\n\n**Error:** The assumption that the middle sums are formed by pairing one of the smallest integers with one of the largest integers is incorrect. \n\n**Reasoning:**  The problem doesn't state that all the sums must be unique.  It's entirely possible for some sums to be repeated.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. **Consider the largest sum:** 29. This must be the sum of the two largest integers.\n2. **Consider the smallest sum:** 10. This must be the sum of the two smallest integers.\n3. **Consider the repeated sum:** Notice that the sum 21 appears twice.  This strongly suggests that one of the smallest integers and one of the largest integers are being paired to form this sum. \n\nNow let's use some algebra:\n\n* Let the smallest two integers be *a* and *b*, where *a* < *b*.\n* Let the largest two integers be *c* and *d*, where *c* < *d*.\n\nWe have the following equations:\n\n* a + b = 10\n* c + d = 29\n* a + d = 21\n* b + c = 21\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n* a = 4\n* b = 6\n* c = 15\n* d = 14\n\n**Therefore, the four integers are 4, 6, 14, and 15.**\n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{4, 6, 14, 15}.
