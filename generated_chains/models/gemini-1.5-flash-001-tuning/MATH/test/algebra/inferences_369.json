At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right rectangular prism with all integer edge lengths, and faces having areas of $30, 180$ and $24$ square centimeters?",
        "inference": "Let the side lengths of the rectangular prism be $a$, $b$, and $c$. We know that:\n\n* $ab = 30$\n* $ac = 180$\n* $bc = 24$\n\nMultiplying all three equations together gives us: \n\n$$(ab)(ac)(bc) = 30 \\cdot 180 \\cdot 24$$ \n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$a^2 b^2 c^2 = 129600$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n$$abc = 360$$\n\nSince the volume of a rectangular prism is $abc$, the volume of this prism is $\\boxed{360}$ cubic centimeters. Final Answer: $\\boxed{360}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the dimensions of the rectangular prism are given by $x$, $y$, and $z$, such that $xy = 30, yz = 180,$ and $zx = 24$. If we multiply all three equations together, we get that $xy \\cdot yz \\cdot zx = (xyz)^2 = 30 \\cdot 180 \\cdot 24$. Using prime factorizations, we find that the right-hand side is equal to $(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5) \\times (2^3 \\cdot 3) = 2^6 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Thus, $(xyz)^2 = (2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5)^2$, so $xyz = \\boxed{360}$. This is the formula for the volume of the box."
