        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a round-robin tournament with $n$ teams, the number of games that must be played is $(n^2-n)/2$. How many teams are in a round-robin tournament in which 55 games are played?",
        "inference": "We are given that $(n^2-n)/2 = 55$.  Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $n^2 - n = 110$.  Subtracting 110 from both sides gives $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$.  Factoring the left side gives $(n-11)(n+10) = 0$.  Therefore, $n = 11$ or $n = -10$.  Since $n$ represents the number of teams, it must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).\n\nThe other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nWe can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \\boxed{11}$."

The formula $(n^2 - n)/2$ is used to calculate the number of games in a tournament where each team plays every other team once.  \n\nThe solution correctly finds the values of *n* that satisfy the equation, but then correctly discards the negative solution because a number of teams cannot be negative.
