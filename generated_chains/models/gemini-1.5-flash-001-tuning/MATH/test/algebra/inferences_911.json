At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$?",

        "ground_truth": "The difference between the second and first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the third and second term is $y - 12$.  These must be equal, so $6 - y = y - 12$.  Solving for $y$, we find $y = \\boxed{9}$."
