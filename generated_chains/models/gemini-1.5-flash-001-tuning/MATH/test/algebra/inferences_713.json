        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three consecutive integers is 27. What is the product of the integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$. The sum of these integers is $x+(x+1)+(x+2)=3x+3=27$. Solving for $x$, we get $3x=24$, so $x=8$. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 8, 9, and 10, and their product is $8\\times9\\times10=\\boxed{720}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{720}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the middle integer, so the integers are $a-1$, $a$, and $a+1$. The sum of the the three integers is $(a-1) + a + (a+1) = 3a$, so $3a = 27$, or $a=9$. So the integers are 8, 9, and 10. Their product is $\\boxed{720}$."
