        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a total of 27 quarters stacked in four piles. The first pile has 5 fewer than the second pile. The second pile has 4 more than the third pile. The fourth pile has three times as many as the second pile. How many quarters are in the fourth pile?",
        "inference": "Let's use variables to represent the number of quarters in each pile:\n\n*  Let  'x' be the number of quarters in the third pile.\n*  The second pile has 4 more than the third, so it has 'x + 4' quarters.\n*  The first pile has 5 fewer than the second, so it has 'x + 4 - 5' or 'x - 1' quarters.\n*  The fourth pile has three times as many as the second, so it has '3(x + 4)' quarters.\n\nThe total number of quarters is 27, so we can set up an equation:\n\n(x - 1) + (x + 4) + x + 3(x + 4) = 27\n\nNow, let's solve for 'x':\n\n*  x - 1 + x + 4 + x + 3x + 12 = 27\n*  6x + 15 = 27\n*  6x = 12\n*  x = 2\n\nThe third pile has 2 quarters.  Since the fourth pile has three times as many as the second, which has 4 more than the third, the fourth pile has:\n\n*  3(2 + 4) = 18 quarters\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=27\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-5\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+4\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=3b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/3$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-4$. Since $b=d/3$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/3-4$. We can substitute $b=d/3$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/3-5$. Substituting $b=d/3$, $c=d/3-4$, and $a=d/3-5$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/3-5)+d/3+(d/3-4)+d=27$, so $d=18$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{18}$ quarters in the fourth pile."
