At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?",

        "ground_truth": "We want $\\pi R^{2}-\\pi r^{2}\\leq 5\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we have $R^{2}-r^{2}\\leq 5$. Factor the left-hand side to get $(R+r)(R-r)\\leq 5$.
