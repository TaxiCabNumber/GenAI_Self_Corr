        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn is 31 years younger than his dad. The sum of their ages is 53 years. How many years old is John's dad?",
        "inference": "Let John's dad's age be $x$ years old. \n\nJohn is 31 years younger than his dad, so John's age is $x-31$.\n\nThe sum of their ages is 53 years, so we can set up the equation: $x+(x-31)=53$.\n\nSimplifying the equation: $2x-31=53$.\n\nAdding 31 to both sides: $2x=84$.\n\nDividing both sides by 2: $x=42$.\n\nTherefore, John's dad is 42 years old.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{42}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $j$ be John's age and $d$ be his dad's age. We are trying to find the value of $d$. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. They are\n\n\\begin{align*}\nj &= d - 31 \\\\\nj + d &= 53 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $d$, so we need to eliminate $j$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $j$, we have $(d-31)+d=53$, or $d=42$. Thus, John's dad is $\\boxed{42}$ years old."
