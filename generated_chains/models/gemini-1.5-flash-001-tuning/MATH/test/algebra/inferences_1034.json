At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a $100$ meter track event, Alice runs at a constant speed and crosses the finish line $5$ seconds before Beatrice does. If it took Beatrice $25$ seconds to complete the race, how many seconds would it take Alice to run $50$ meters?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\n* Beatrice took $25$ seconds to run $100$ meters, so she ran at a speed of $100/25 = 4$ meters per second.\n* Alice finished $5$ seconds before Beatrice, meaning Alice took $25 - 5 = 20$ seconds to run $100$ meters.\n* Alice's speed is $100/20 = 5$ meters per second.\n* To run $50$ meters, Alice would take $50/5 = 10$ seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Alice took $25 - 5 = 20$ seconds to complete the race. If she can run $100$ meters in $20$ seconds, by direct proportionality, she must be able to run $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ meters in $\\frac{20}{2} = \\boxed{10}$ seconds."
