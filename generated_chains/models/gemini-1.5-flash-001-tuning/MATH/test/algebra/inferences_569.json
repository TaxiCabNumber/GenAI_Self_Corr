        "ground_truth": "In order to get rid of the cube root, we start by cubing the both sides of the equation \\begin{align*} (\\sqrt[3]{4x^2})^3&=(4)^3\n\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad 4x^2& =64\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2& =16\n\\end{align*}From here, we can see that the only possible values of $x$ are 4 and -4.
