At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all integer values of $x$ such that $\\frac{3}{x}$ is greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$ and less than $\\frac{3}{4}$?",

We can do that in this case, because all solutions of the original inequalities are clearly positive. Reciprocating all three quantities in this compound inequality, we get \\[\n3>\\frac{x}{3}>\\frac{4}{3}.\n\\] Now multiply both sides by $3$ to find that $4<x<9$.  The sum of the integer values of $x$ which satisfy this inequality is $5+6+7+8=\\boxed{26}$."
