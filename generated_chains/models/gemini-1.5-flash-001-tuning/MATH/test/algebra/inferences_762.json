        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $(26^2 - 24^2 - 10)^2 - 10^2$?",

        "ground_truth": "We know that $x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y)$. To begin with, let $x = 26^2 - 24^2 - 10$ and $y = 10$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $(26^2-24^2-10+10)(26^2-24^2-10-10)$. Now, let $x = 26$ and $y = 24$. Factoring $x^2 - y^2$ and substituting in gives $((26+24)(26-24)-10+10)((26+24)(26-24)-10-10)$. This simplifies to $(50\\cdot 2)(50 \\cdot 2 - 20)$, or $100 \\cdot 80$. Thus, our final answer is $\\boxed{8000}$."
