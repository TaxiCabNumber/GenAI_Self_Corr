At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all possible values of $x$ such that $2x(x-10)=-50$?",

        "ground_truth": "First we divide both sides by 2 to get $x(x-10)=-25$. Expanding the left side and bringing the constant over, we get $x^2-10x+25=0$. We can factor this into $(x-5)(x-5)$, so the only possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is also our answer."
