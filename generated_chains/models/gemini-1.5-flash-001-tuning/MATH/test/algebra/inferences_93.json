        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the average of integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ if the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2b$ is 7 and the average of the two numbers $a$ and $2c$ is 8?",
        "inference": "The average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2.  Thus, the average of $a$ and $2b$ being 7 means $\\frac{a+2b}{2}=7$.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $a+2b=14$.  Similarly, the average of $a$ and $2c$ being 8 means $\\frac{a+2c}{2}=8$, which simplifies to $a+2c=16$.\n\nWe want to find the average of $a$, $b$, and $c$, which is $\\frac{a+b+c}{3}$.  To get this expression, we can add $b$ to both sides of $a+2b=14$ and add $c$ to both sides of $a+2c=16$ to get the equations $a+2b+b=14+b$ and $a+2c+c=16+c$.  Adding these equations together, we get $(a+2b+b)+(a+2c+c)=(14+b)+(16+c)$, or $2a+3b+3c=30+b+c$.  Subtracting $b+c$ from both sides gives us $2a+2b+2c=30$, which simplifies to $a+b+c=15$.\n\nThe average of $a$, $b$, and $c$ is then $\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=\\frac{15}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$.
