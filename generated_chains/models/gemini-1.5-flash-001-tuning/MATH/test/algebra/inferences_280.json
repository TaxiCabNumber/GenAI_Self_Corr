At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, how many lattice points does the line $y = -2x + 18$ pass through? (A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe see that the line has a $y$-intercept of 18, and a slope of $-2$. Since the slope is negative, the line is decreasing. We can write $x = \\frac{18-y}{2}$. We see that if $y$ is even, $x$ is an integer. If $y$ is odd, $x$ is not an integer. So, the line passes through a lattice point for every even integer $y$ between $0$ and $18$. \n\nThere are $10$ even integers between $0$ and $18$ (namely, $0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,$ and $18$).\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points."
