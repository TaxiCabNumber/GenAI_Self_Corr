At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe doctor has told Cal O'Ree that during his ten weeks of working out at the gym, he can expect each week's weight loss to be $1\\%$ of his weight at the end of the previous week. His weight at the beginning of the workouts is $244$ pounds. How many pounds does he expect to weigh at the end of the ten weeks? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
