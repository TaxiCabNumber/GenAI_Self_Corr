At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $(x + y)^2 = 105$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 65$, what is the value of $xy$?",

        "ground_truth": "If we expand the left hand side of the first equation, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 105$, so $2xy + (x^2 + y^2) = 105$. We are given that $x^2 + y^2 = 65$, so we can substitute for $x^2 + y^2$ to obtain $2xy + 65 = 105$. It follows that $xy = \\boxed{20}$."
