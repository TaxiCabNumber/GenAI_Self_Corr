        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnna, Bertram, Carli, and David have a competition to see which of them can hold their breath for the longest time period, in minutes. If Bertram, Carli, and David add their times together, the resulting sum is three times the length of time that Anna can hold her breath. Similarly, if Anna, Carli, and David sum their times, the result is four times Bertram's time period, and if Anna, Bertram, and David sum their times, the result is twice Carli's time. Finally, eight times Anna's time plus ten times Bertram's time plus six times Carli's time equals two fifths of an hour. If the length of time that David can hold his breath is expressed in minutes as a simplified fraction, what is the sum of the numerator and the denominator?",
        "inference": "Let $A$ be the length of time Anna can hold her breath, $B$ be the length of time Bertram can hold his breath, $C$ be the length of time Carli can hold her breath, and $D$ be the length of time David can hold his breath.  We are given the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nB + C + D &= 3A \\\\\nA + C + D &= 4B \\\\\nA + B + D &= 2C \\\\\n8A + 10B + 6C &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 60\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving the first equation for $D$, we get $D = 3A - B - C$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $A + C + 3A - B - C = 4B$, which simplifies to $4A - 5B = 0$. Solving this for $A$, we get $A = \\frac{5}{4}B$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $B + C + 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}B - B - C = 3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}B$, which simplifies to $\\frac{11}{4}B = \\frac{15}{4}B$.  This implies $B = 0$, so $A = 0$ as well.  \n\nSubstituting $A = B = 0$ into the third equation, we get $D = 2C$.  Substituting $A = 0$ and $B = 0$ into the fourth equation, we get $6C = 24$, so $C = 4$.  Then $D = 2C = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the length of time, in minutes, that Anna holds her breath, $b$ denote the time that Bertram holds his breath, $c$ denote the time that Carli holds her breath, and $d$ denote the time that David holds his breath. Using the information in the problem, we can form the following system of linear equations (note that $\\frac{2}{5}$ of an hour is the same as $24$ minutes):  \\begin{align*}\n3a &= b + c + d \\\\\n4b &= a + c + d \\\\\n2c &= a + b + d \\\\\n8a + 10b + 6c &= 24\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the third equation from the first gives $3a - 2c = c - a$, which simplifies to $4a = 3c$. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives $4b - 2c = c - b$, so $5b = 3c$. We thus have that $4a = 5b = 3c$. Call this value $x$. Substituting $x$ for $4a$, $5b$, and $3c$ in the fourth equation gives $6x = 24$, so $x = 4$. Therefore, $a = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, $b = \\frac{4}{5}$, and $c = \\frac{4}{3}$.

        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's an error in the solution. The problem is that we can't simply assume that $B=0$ just because $\\frac{11}{4}B = \\frac{15}{4}B$. This equation is only true if $B=0$, but it doesn't mean that it *must* be zero.  \n\nHere's how to solve it correctly:\n\n1. **Solve the system of equations.** We have four equations and four unknowns, so we can solve for all the variables.  You can use substitution, elimination, or matrices to do this.  Here's one way using substitution:\n\n   * We already have  $D = 3A - B - C$.\n   * Substitute this into the second equation: $A + C + (3A - B - C) = 4B$, which simplifies to $4A - 5B = 0$.\n   * Substitute $D = 3A - B - C$ into the third equation: $A + B + (3A - B - C) = 2C$, which simplifies to $4A - 3C = 0$.\n   * Now we have two equations with two unknowns:\n      * $4A - 5B = 0$\n      * $4A - 3C = 0$\n   * Solve for $A$ in terms of $B$ from the first equation: $A = \\frac{5}{4}B$\n   * Substitute this into the second equation: $4 \\left(\\frac{5}{4}B\\right) - 3C = 0$, which simplifies to $5B - 3C = 0$.\n   * Solve for $C$ in terms of $B$: $C = \\frac{5}{3}B$\n   * Now we can substitute these values of $A$ and $C$ back into the equation for $D$: $D = 3 \\left(\\frac{5}{4}B\\right) - B - \\frac{5}{3}B = \\frac{11}{12}B$.\n\n2. **Substitute into the fourth equation:** We now have expressions for all the variables in terms of $B$. Substitute them into the fourth equation:\n\n   * $8 \\left(\\frac{5}{4}B\\right) + 10B + 6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}B\\right) = 24$\n   * Simplify: $10B + 10B + 10B = 24$\n   * Solve for $B$: $B = \\frac{24}{30} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n\n3. **Calculate the other variables:**\n   * $A = \\frac{5}{4}B = \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 1$\n   * $C = \\frac{5}{3}B = \\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n   * $D = \\frac{11}{12}B = \\frac{11}{12} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{11}{15}$\n\n4. **Find the sum:** $A + B + C + D = 1 + \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{11}{15} = \\boxed{\\frac{112}{15}}$. \n",
