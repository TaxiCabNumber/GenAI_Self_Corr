        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDiana can either invest $20,\\!000$ dollars for $4$ years with a simple interest rate of $6\\%$ or an interest rate of $7\\%$ which compounds quarterly. How many more dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar, would she get with the better interest rate than with the worse one?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{\\$386}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "She would get $20000 \\cdot 0.06=1200$ dollars per year from the simple interest. This gives her $20000+4\\cdot1200=24800$ dollars in the end.\n\nFor the compounded interest, we use the formula $A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year. This equation represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with a rate of $r/n$ each time. Substituting the information given, we get $$A=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 4}=20000\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{16} \\approx 26399.$$Therefore, she should choose the compounded interest and earn $26399-24800=\\boxed{1599 \\text{ dollars}}$ more."
