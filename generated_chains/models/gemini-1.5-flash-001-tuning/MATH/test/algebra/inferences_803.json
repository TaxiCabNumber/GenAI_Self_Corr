At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two consecutive odd whole numbers is 255. What is the greater number?",
        "inference": "Let the smaller odd number be $x$.\nThen the larger odd number is $x+2$.\nTheir product is $x(x+2)=255$.\nExpanding the equation: $x^2+2x=255$.\nSubtracting 255 from both sides: $x^2+2x-255=0$.\nFactoring the quadratic equation: $(x-15)(x+17)=0$.\nTherefore, $x=15$ or $x=-17$.\nSince the question asks for a whole number, $x=15$.\nTherefore the larger number is $x+2=15+2=17$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-1, 2n+1$ be two consecutive odd whole numbers. We know $(2n-1)(2n+1)=4n^2-1=255\\Leftrightarrow n^2=64$. $n$ is a whole number, so $n=8$. The greater number is $2n+1=2\\cdot8+1=\\boxed{17}$."
