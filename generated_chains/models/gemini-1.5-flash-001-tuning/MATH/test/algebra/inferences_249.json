        "inference": "The error is in the assumption that $k$ must be negative. The problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the sign of $k$. We can have $k=3$ as well.  \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nFrom $k^2 = 9$, we have $k = \\pm 3$. Since the problem asks for the value of $b$, we need to consider both possibilities:\n\n* If $k=3$, then $-b = 2k+k = 9$, so $b = \\boxed{-9}$.\n* If $k=-3$, then $-b = 2k+k = -9$, so $b = \\boxed{9}$.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible values for $b$, $\\boxed{-9}$ and $\\boxed{9}$. \n",
