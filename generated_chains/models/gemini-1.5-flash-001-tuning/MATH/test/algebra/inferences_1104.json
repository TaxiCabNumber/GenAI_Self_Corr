At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA shop sells 500 smartphones a week for $\\$450$ each. A market survey shows that each decrease of $\\$5$ on the price will result in the sale of an additional 10 smartphones per week. What price of the smartphone would result in maximum revenue, in dollars?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of $\\$5$ decreases in price.  Then the price of each smartphone is $450-5x$ dollars, and the number of smartphones sold per week is $500+10x$.  The revenue $R$ is then\n\\[R = (450 - 5x)(500 + 10x) = 225000 + 5000x - 2500x - 50x^2 = -50x^2 + 2500x + 225000.\\]This is a quadratic function whose graph is a parabola opening downward.  The maximum value occurs at the vertex, which has $x$-coordinate\n\\[x = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-2500}{2(-50)} = 25.\\]Therefore, the price of the smartphone that would result in maximum revenue is $450 - 5 \\cdot 25 = \\boxed{\\$325}$.  \n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{\\$325}. I hope it is correct. \n",
