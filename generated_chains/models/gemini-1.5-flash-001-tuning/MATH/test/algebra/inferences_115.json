At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nToday a father's age is five times his son's age. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today?",
        "inference": "Let the son's current age be $x$. \nThen, the father's current age is $5x$.\nThree years ago, the son's age was $x-3$ and the father's age was $5x-3$.\nThe sum of their ages three years ago was $x-3+5x-3=30$\nSimplifying the equation, we get $6x-6=30$\nAdding 6 to both sides gives $6x=36$\nDividing both sides by 6, we get $x=6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the son's age today and his father's age $y$.  We know: $5x = y$, and that $(x -3) + (y -3) = 30$.  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: $6x = 36$, and thus, $x=\\boxed{6}$."
