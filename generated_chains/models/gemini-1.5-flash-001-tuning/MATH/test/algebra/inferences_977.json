At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEric's sports car's specifications include a $500$ metric horsepower engine. Eric wants to know how many kilowatts of power his car's engine can generate. What result should Eric obtain if $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower? (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest kilowatt.)",
