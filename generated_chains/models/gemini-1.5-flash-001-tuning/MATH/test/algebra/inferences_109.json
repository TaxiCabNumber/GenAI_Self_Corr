This can be factored into $$(x^2 + 2)(2y^3 - 3) = 143$$Since we know that the prime factorization of $143 = 11 \\cdot 13$, we have that $2y^3 - 3$ must equal $\\pm1, \\pm11, \\pm13$ or $\\pm143$. The only possible values of $y$ are $1$ and $2.$ For $y = 1,$ there are no solutions. For $y = 2,$ we have $x = 3.$ Therefore, $x + y = \\boxed{5}$."
