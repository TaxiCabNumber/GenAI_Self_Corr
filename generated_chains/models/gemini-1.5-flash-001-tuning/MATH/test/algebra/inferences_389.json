At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind all values of $x$ where there is a vertical asymptote for the equation $y=\\frac{x+1}{x^2-2x+1}$.",
        "inference": "Solution: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function equals zero. We need to find the values of $x$ that make the denominator, $x^2 - 2x + 1$, equal to zero. Factoring the denominator, we get $(x-1)^2$.  Setting this equal to zero, we have $(x-1)^2 = 0$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $x-1 = 0$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by factoring the denominator: $y=\\frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2}$. There is a vertical asymptote at $x=a$ for a rational function if the denominator is zero when $x=a$ (except when $x-a$ is also a factor of the numerator and has the same multiplicity as it does in the denominator). The only value of $x$ where that occurs is $x=\\boxed{1}$."
