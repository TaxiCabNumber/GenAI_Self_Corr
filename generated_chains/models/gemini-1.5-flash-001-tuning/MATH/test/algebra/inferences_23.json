At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some hydrogen in a 3.67 liter container with a pressure of 4 kPa. If I move all of it to a 1.835 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the pressure $p$ of the hydrogen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=3.67\\cdot4=14.68$. Consequently, when we move it to the 1.835 liter container, we get that $1.835p=14.68$, so $p=\\boxed{8}$ kPa."
