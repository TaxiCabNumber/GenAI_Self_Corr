        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it incorrectly completes the square.  Here's a corrected approach:\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n \n $$6mn + 3m + 2n - 27 = 0$$\n\nTo factor the left-hand side, we can add 27 to both sides and then factor by grouping:\n\n$$6mn + 3m + 2n + 27 = 27$$\n$$3m(2n + 1) + 1(2n + 1) = 27$$\n$$(3m + 1)(2n + 1) = 27$$\n\nNow we consider the factors of 27: 1, 3, 9, and 27.  We can set up the following possibilities:\n\n* $3m + 1 = 1$ and $2n + 1 = 27$\n* $3m + 1 = 3$ and $2n + 1 = 9$\n* $3m + 1 = 9$ and $2n + 1 = 3$\n* $3m + 1 = 27$ and $2n + 1 = 1$\n\nSolving each of these possibilities, we find the following solutions:\n\n* $m = 0$, $n = 13$\n* $m = \\frac{2}{3}$, $n = 4$ \n* $m = \\frac{8}{3}$, $n = 1$\n* $m = 8$, $n = 0$\n\nSince we are looking for positive integer solutions, the only solution that works is $\\boxed{(m,n) = (8,0)}$.
