At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose a function $f(x)$ has domain $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ and range $[-11,3]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(6x)+1,$$ then what is the range of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "Since $f(x)$ has range $[-11,3]$, we know that $-11 \\le f(x) \\le 3$ for all $x$.  Adding 1 to all parts of this inequality, we get $-10 \\le f(x) + 1 \\le 4$.  Since $g(x) = f(6x) + 1$, this tells us that $-10 \\le g(x) \\le 4$ for all $x$.  Therefore, the range of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-10,4]}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, note that $f(x)$ and $f(6x)$ have the same range, because every value assumed by $f(x)$ (at, say, $x=a$) is also assumed by $f(6x)$ (at $x=\\frac a6$), and vice versa.\n\nSince $g(x)=f(6x)+1$, its range is equal to the range of $f(6x)$ with all values increased by $1$. Thus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11+1,3+1] = \\boxed{[-10,4]}$."
