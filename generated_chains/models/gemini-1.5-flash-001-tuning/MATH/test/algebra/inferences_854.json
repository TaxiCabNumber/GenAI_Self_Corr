        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFake gold bricks are made by covering concrete cubes with gold paint, so the cost of the paint is proportional to their surface area while the cost of the concrete is proportional to their volume.  If a 1 inch cube costs $\\$1.30$ to make while a 2 inch cube costs $\\$6.80$, then how much would a 3 inch cube cost?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the cost of painting one square inch of surface area and $y$ be the cost of one cubic inch of concrete.  The surface area of a 1 inch cube is $6 \\text{ in}^2$ and the volume is $1 \\text{ in}^3$, so $6x+y = 1.30$.  The surface area of a 2 inch cube is $24 \\text{ in}^2$ and the volume is $8 \\text{ in}^3$, so $24x+8y=6.80$.  Multiplying the first equation by $-4$, we get $-24x-4y = -5.20$.  Adding this to the second equation, we get $4y=1.60$ so $y = 0.40$.  Substituting into the first equation, we get $6x+0.40=1.30$ so $x=0.15$.  The surface area of a 3 inch cube is $54 \\text{ in}^2$ and the volume is $27 \\text{ in}^3$, so the cost is $54(0.15)+27(0.40)=\\boxed{\\$20.70}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$20.70}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the cost per square inch of gold paint, and let $y$ be the cost per cubic inch of concrete.  Since a 1 inch cube has surface area 6 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 1 $\\text{in}^3$ its total price will be $6x+y$ dollars.  Similarly, a 2 inch cube has surface area 24 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 8 $\\text{in}^3$, so its total price will be $24x+8y$ dollars.  We are given that \\begin{align*} 6x+y &=\\$1.30 \\\\ 24x+8y&= \\$6.80 \\end{align*} Subtracting 4 times the first equation from the second gives $4y=\\$1.60$, so $y=\\$0.40$.  Hence $6x=\\$0.90$, so $x=\\$0.15$.  Since a 3 inch cube has surface area 54 $\\text{in}^2$ and volume 27 $\\text{in}^3$, its total price will be a total of $54(\\$0.15)+27(\\$0.40)=\\boxed{\\$18.90}$."
