At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "First, we find the inverse function $h^{-1}(x)$.  Let $x = h(y) = \\dfrac{1+y}{2-y}$.  Solving for $y$, we find\n\\[x(2-y) = 1+y.\\]Then $2x - xy = 1 + y$, so $2x - 1 = y + xy = y(1+x)$.  Hence,\n\\[y = \\frac{2x - 1}{1 + x}.\\]Thus, $h^{-1}(x) = \\dfrac{2x - 1}{1 + x}$.\n\nTherefore,\n\\[h^{-1}(5) = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5 - 1}{1 + 5} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\\]",
        "ground_truth": "$h^{-1}(5)$ is defined as the number $y$ such that $h(y)=5$. Thus, we solve the equation $$\\frac{1+y}{2-y} = 5.$$Multiplying both sides by $2-y$, we have $$1+y = 5(2-y).$$Expanding gives $$1+y = 10-5y,$$then adding $5y-1$ to both sides gives $$6y = 9.$$Finally, we divide both sides by $6$ and simplify to get $y=\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}}$.\n\nNote that we can check our work by plugging $\\dfrac{3}{2}$ into the formula for $h$: $$\\dfrac{1+\\frac32}{2-\\frac32} = \\dfrac{\\left(\\frac52\\right)}{\\left(\\frac12\\right)} = 5,$$which is what we expected."
