At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat are the coordinates of the point on the line $5x-9y=42$ such that the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are the additive inverses of each other? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
        "inference": "If the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are additive inverses of each other, then $y=-x$. Substituting this into the equation of the line gives $5x-9(-x)=42$. Combining like terms gives $14x=42$, so $x=3$. Since $y=-x$, we have $y=-3$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(3,-3)}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Our point lies on $5x-9y=42$ with the condition that $x=-y$. Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5x-9y &= 42\\\\\nx &= -y.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $x= -y$ into the first equation gives  \\begin{align*}\n5(-y) -9y &=42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -14y &= 42\\\\\n\\Rightarrow y &=-3.\n\\end{align*} Thus $x = -y = -(-3) = 3$, so our desired point is $\\boxed{(3,-3)}$."
