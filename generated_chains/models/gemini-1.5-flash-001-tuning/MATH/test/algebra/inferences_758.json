At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe $XYZ$ company has to pay $\\$5,000$ for rent each month. In addition, their monthly electricity bill is$ \\$1.45$ per kilowatt-hour of electricity used. If the total cost for both rent and electricity in January was $\\$16,520.25$, how many kilowatt-hours of electricity did they use?",
