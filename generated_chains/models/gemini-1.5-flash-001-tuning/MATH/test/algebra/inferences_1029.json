At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob can travel $m$ miles in $h$ hours on his bicycle. At this rate, how many hours would it take him to travel $h$ miles? Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $h$.",
