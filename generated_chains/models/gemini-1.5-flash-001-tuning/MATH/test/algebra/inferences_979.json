At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTogether, Larry and Lenny have $\\$$35. Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount. How many more dollars than Larry does Lenny have?",

Then Larry has $\\frac{2}{5}x$ dollars. \n \n Together they have $x + \\frac{2}{5}x = \\frac{7}{5}x$ dollars, which equals \\$35. \n \n Solving for $x$, we get $\\frac{7}{5}x = 35 \\implies x = 35 \\times \\frac{5}{7} = 25$. So Lenny has \\$25. \n \n Larry has $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25 = 10$ dollars. \n \n Lenny has $25 - 10 = 15$ more dollars than Larry.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Call the amount of money Larry has $a$ and the amount of money Lenny has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 35 \\\\\na &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot b \\\\\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $\\frac{2}{5} b + b = 35$. Solving for $b$ gives $\\frac{7}{5} b = 35$, or $b = 25$. Thus, $a = 35 - 25 = 10$. So Lenny has $25 - 10 = \\boxed{15}$ more dollars than Larry."
