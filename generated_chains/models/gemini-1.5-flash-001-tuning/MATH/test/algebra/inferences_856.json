At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nExpress $0.1\\overline{7}$ as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.1\\overline{7}$.  Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x = 1.\\overline{7}$.  Multiplying both sides by 10 again, we get $100x = 17.\\overline{7}$.  Subtracting the equation $10x = 1.\\overline{7}$ from the equation $100x = 17.\\overline{7}$, we get $90x = 16$, so $x = \\frac{16}{90} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{45}}$.
