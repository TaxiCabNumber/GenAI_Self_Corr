At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the roots of the quadratic be $r$ and $s$. Then by Vieta's formulas, $r+s=-2$ and $rs=-\\frac{1}{2}$. We want to find $r^2+s^2$. Notice that $(r+s)^2=r^2+2rs+s^2$. Substituting, we have $(-2)^2=r^2+2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+s^2$. Simplifying, we get $4=r^2+s^2-1$. Thus, $r^2+s^2=5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Letting the solutions to the given equation be $p$ and $q$, we have $p+q = -4/2 = -2$ and $pq = -1/2$, so the answer is $p^2+q^2 = (p+q)^2-2pq=(-2)^2-2(-1/2) = \\boxed{5}$."
