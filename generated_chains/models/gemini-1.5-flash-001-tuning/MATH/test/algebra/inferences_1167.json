At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive real numbers satisfying: \\begin{align*}\n\\log x - \\log y &= a, \\\\\n\\log y - \\log z &= 15, \\text{ and} \\\\\n\\log z - \\log x &= -7, \\\\\n\\end{align*}where $a$ is a real number, what is $a$?",

Adding all three equations together yields $\\log\\frac{x}{y} + \\log\\frac{y}{z} + \\log\\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7$.
