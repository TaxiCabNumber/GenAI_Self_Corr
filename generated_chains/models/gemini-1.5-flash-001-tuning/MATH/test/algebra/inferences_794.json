At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=3f\\left(2x\\right)+1$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. What is the sum of coordinates of that point?",
        "inference": "Since the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=3f\\left(2x\\right)+1$, we have $7=3f(8)+1$.  Solving for $f(8)$, we find $f(8)=2$.  Since the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=3f\\left(2x\\right)+1$, the point $(2,2)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. The sum of the coordinates of this point is $2+2=\\boxed{4}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Given that $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=3f\\left(2x\\right)+1$, we can substitute $x=4$ and $y=7$ in that equation to obtain $$7 = 3f\\left(2\\cdot4\\right)+1.$$We can rewrite this information as $$2 = f(8),$$which tells us that $(8,2)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. The sum of coordinates of this point is $\\boxed{10}$."
