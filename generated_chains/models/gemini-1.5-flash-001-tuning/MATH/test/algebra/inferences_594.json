The values of $x$ and $y$ are determined by the system of equations, and we don't have enough information to solve for them. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to work with the original system of equations:\n\n* $ax+by+c=4$\n* $bx+cy+a=5$\n* $cx+ay+b=6$\n\nAdding all three equations, we get:\n\n$(a+b+c)x + (a+b+c)y + (a+b+c) = 15$\n\nFactoring out $(a+b+c)$, we have:\n\n$(a+b+c)(x+y+1) = 15$\n\nSince we are asked to find the value of $a+b+c$, we need to eliminate the $x$ and $y$ terms. There is no way to do this directly from the equation above.  \n\n**Therefore, there is not enough information to solve for $a+b+c$.** \n",
