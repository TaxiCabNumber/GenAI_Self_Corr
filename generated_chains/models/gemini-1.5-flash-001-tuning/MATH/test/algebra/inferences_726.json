        "ground_truth": "The numerator is equal to $x^{1+2+3+\\cdots + 9}$. The exponent is the sum of the first 9 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $\\frac{9\\cdot10}{2}=45$.

The exponent is twice the sum of the first 6 consecutive positive integers, so its sum is $2\\cdot \\frac{6\\cdot7}{2}=42$.
