        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo identical blue boxes together weigh the same as three identical red boxes together. Each red box weighs 15.2 ounces. How much does one blue box weigh in ounces?",
        "inference": "Let $b$ be the weight of a blue box and $r$ be the weight of a red box. We are given that $2b=3r$ and $r=15.2$. Substituting $r$ into the first equation gives $2b=3(15.2)$. Solving for $b$ gives $b=\\frac{3(15.2)}{2}$.  Simplifying this expression yields $b=22.8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22.8}$ ounces. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since one red box weighs 15.2 ounces, three red boxes weigh 45.6 ounces.  This is the same as two blue boxes, so  we have the equation $2b=45.6$ where $b$ represents the weight of the blue box. Solving the equation by multiplying both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to isolate $b$ gives us $b=\\boxed{22.8}$ ounces."
