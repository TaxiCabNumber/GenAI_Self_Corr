        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cones have the same volume. If one has a base with radius 3 times as large as the other's and a height of 24 inches, how many inches tall is the other?\n\nNote: The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.",
        "inference": "Let the radius of the smaller cone be $r$ and its height be $h$. Then the radius of the larger cone is $3r$, and its height is 24 inches. We are given that the two cones have the same volume, so:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3r)^2 (24)$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n$$r^2 h = 9r^2 (24)$$\n\nDividing both sides by $r^2$, we get:\n\n$$h = 9 (24)$$\n\nTherefore, the height of the smaller cone is:\n\n$$h = 216$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{216}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The volume is proportional to the square of the base radius and to the height, so if these have the same volume, their heights are inversely proportional to the square of the radii. This means that with a radius 1/3 as big as the first, the second cone has a height of $24\\left(\\frac1{1/3}\\right)^2=24\\cdot9=\\boxed{216}$ inches."

        "inference": "You're right! The error is in the calculation of the height.
