At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA worker receives an annual wage of $\\$20{,}000$, which he always deposits into a savings account at the end of the year. By the end of the third year (when he makes the third deposit), he wants to have at least $\\$66,200$ in the account to finance the purchase of a house. What is the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide? Express your answer as a percentage, but do not include the percent sign.",

We can try different values of $r$ to see which work.  For example, if $r = 0.05$, then $(1 + r)^4 - 1 = 1.05^4 - 1 \\approx 0.2155$, while $3.31r = 0.1655$.  So $r = 0.05$ is too small.  If $r = 0.06$, then $(1 + r)^4 - 1 = 1.06^4 - 1 \\approx 0.2625$, while $3.31r = 0.1986$.  So $r = 0.06$ is too small.  If $r = 0.07$, then $(1 + r)^4 - 1 = 1.07^4 - 1 \\approx 0.3108$, while $3.31r = 0.2317$.  So $r = 0.07$ is too small.
