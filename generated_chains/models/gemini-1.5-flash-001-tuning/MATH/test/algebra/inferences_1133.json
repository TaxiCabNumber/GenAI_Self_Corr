At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent wedding, the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age. If the sum of their ages was 51 years, how old was the groom?",
        "inference": "Let the bride's age be $x$ years.\nThen, the groom's age is $\\frac{x}{2} + 15$ years.\nAccording to the problem, $x + \\frac{x}{2} + 15 = 51$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{3x}{2} = 51 - 15 = 36$\n$\\Rightarrow 3x = 36\\times 2 = 72$\n$\\Rightarrow x = \\frac{72}{3} = 24$\nTherefore, the groom's age is $\\frac{24}{2} + 15 = 27$ years.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the groom's age be $g$ and the bride's age be $b$. We are trying to find the value of $g$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: \\begin{align*}\ng &= \\frac{1}{2}b + 15 \\\\\ng + b &= 51.\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the statement ``the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``if the sum of their ages was 51 years...'' We are solving for $g$, so we want to eliminate $b$. From the second equation, we get that $b=51-g$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $b$, we have $g=\\frac{1}{2}(51-g)+15$, from which we get that $g=27$. Thus, the groom's age is $\\boxed{27}$ years old."
