At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA line parallel to $y = 4x + 6$ passes through $(5, 10)$. What is the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the $y$-axis?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the line is parallel to $y = 4x + 6$, we know that its slope is 4.  Thus the equation of the line is $y = 4x + b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept.  Plugging $(5, 10)$ into this gives $10 = 4\\cdot 5 + b \\Rightarrow b = \\boxed{-10}$ which is what we wanted."
