We do this by completing the square:\n\n$(x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) = -c$\n\nTo complete the square for the $x$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of our $x$ term ($-10$), square it ($(-5)^2 = 25$), and add it to both sides:\n\n$(x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y) = -c + 25$\n\nTo complete the square for the $y$ terms, we take half of the coefficient of our $y$ term ($6$), square it ($3^2 = 9$), and add it to both sides:\n\n$(x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = -c + 25 + 9$\n\nNow we can rewrite the left side as squared terms:\n\n$(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = -c + 34$\n\nThis is now in standard form, $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius.
