At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+18x=27$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?",

        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we add $(18/2)^2=81$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+18x+81=108 \\Rightarrow (x+9)^2=108$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+9=\\sqrt{108}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{108}-9$. Thus, $a=108$ and $b=9$, so $a+b=\\boxed{117}$."
