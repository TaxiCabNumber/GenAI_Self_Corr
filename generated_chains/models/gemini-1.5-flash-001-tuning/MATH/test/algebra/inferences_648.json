        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile on her vacation in Cancun, Colleen can buy a sombrero and a pair of flip-flops for $\\$32$. She can buy the pair of flip-flops and sunglasses for $\\$42$. She can buy the sombrero and the sunglasses for $\\$30$. How many dollars does the sombrero cost?",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the cost of the sombrero, $f$ the cost of the flip-flops, and $g$ the cost of the sunglasses.  We are given the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns + f &= 32 \\\\\nf + g &= 42 \\\\\ns + g &= 30\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubtracting the third equation from the first equation, we get $f - g = 2$. Adding this equation to the second equation, we get $2f = 44$, so $f = 22$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $s + 22 = 32$, so $s = 10$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $\\$ x, \\$ y$ and $\\$ z$ be the prices of a sombrero, a pair of flip-flops and sunglasses, respectively. We can then rewrite the problem as a system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 32\\\\\ny+z &= 42\\\\\nx+z &= 30\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x+2y+2z &= 32+42+30 = 104\\\\\nx+y+z &= 52\n\\end{align*} So $x = (x+y+z)-(y+z) = 52-42=10$. So the sombrero costs $\\boxed{\\$ 10}$."
