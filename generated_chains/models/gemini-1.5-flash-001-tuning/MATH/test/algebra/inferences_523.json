        "ground_truth": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{5}}125\\sqrt{5}$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{5})^x = 125\\sqrt{5}$.  Writing both sides with 5 as the base gives us $5^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 5^3\\cdot 5^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 5^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$."
