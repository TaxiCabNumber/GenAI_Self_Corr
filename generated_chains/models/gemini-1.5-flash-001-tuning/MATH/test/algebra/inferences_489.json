At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive difference between the squares of two consecutive odd integers is 128. What is the product of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive odd integers be $x$ and $x+2$. We are given that $(x+2)^2-x^2=128$. Expanding the left side gives $x^2+4x+4-x^2=128$. Simplifying, we get $4x+4=128$. Solving for $x$, we have $x=31$. The two consecutive odd integers are 31 and 33, and their product is $31\\cdot33=\\boxed{1023}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{1023}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a, a+2$ be the two integers. We are given that $(a+2)^2-a^2 = 128$. Using the difference of squares factorization, the equation becomes $(a+2+a)(a+2-a) = 128$. Simplifying and solving, we get: \\begin{align*}\n(2a+2)(2) &= 128\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2a+2 &= 64\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2a &= 62\\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= 31.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Therefore the desired product is $a(a+2) = 31\\cdot33 = \\boxed{1023}$."
