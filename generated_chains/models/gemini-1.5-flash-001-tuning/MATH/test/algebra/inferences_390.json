I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of playing cards with $26$ red cards and $26$ black cards is split into two piles, each having at least one card. In pile $A$ there are six times as many black cards as red cards. In pile $B,$ the number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. How many red cards are in pile $B?$",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the number of red cards in pile $A$ and $b$ be the number of black cards in pile $A.$  Then $b = 6r.$  Since there are 26 red cards total, the number of red cards in pile $B$ is $26 - r.$  Since there are 26 black cards total, the number of black cards in pile $B$ is $26 - b = 26 - 6r.$  Since the number of red cards in pile $B$ is a multiple of the number of black cards in pile $B,$ $26 - r$ is a multiple of $26 - 6r.$\n\nWe can write\n\\[26 - r = k(26 - 6r)\\]for some positive integer $k.$  Expanding, we get\n\\[26 - r = 26k - 6kr.\\]Then $6kr - r = 26k - 26,$ so\n\\[(6k - 1) r = 26(k - 1).\\]Since $r$ is a positive integer, $6k - 1$ must divide 26.  The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26.  The only solution in positive integers is $k = 1,$ so $r = 0.$  This is impossible, since pile $A$ must have at least one card.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution, which means there must be an error in the problem statement.  We can try to fix the problem by changing the condition that the number of red cards in pile $B$ is a multiple of the number of black cards in pile $B,$ to the condition that the number of black cards in pile $B$ is a multiple of the number of red cards in pile $B.$\n\nThen, we have the equation\n\\[26 - 6r = k(26 - r)\\]for some positive integer $k.$  Expanding, we get\n\\[26 - 6r = 26k - kr.\\]Then $kr - 6r = 26k - 26,$ so\n\\[(k - 6) r = 26(k - 1).\\]Since $r$ is a positive integer, $k - 6$ must divide 26.  The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, and 26.  The only solution in positive integers is $k = 7,$ so $r = 26.$  This is impossible, since pile $A$ must have at least one black card.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution, even with the modified condition.
