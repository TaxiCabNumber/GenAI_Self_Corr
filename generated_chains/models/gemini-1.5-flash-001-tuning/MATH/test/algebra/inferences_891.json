At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDr. Zaius invests $\\$10,000$ in a CD with an annual interest rate of $4\\%$ that compounds semi-annually (twice a year).  After six months, he rolls over the CD into another CD with an annual interest rate of $5\\%$ that also compounds semi-annually.  After six months in the second CD, how much does Dr. Zaius have, in dollars?",

The second CD compounds at a rate of $5/2 = 2.5$ percent for the next six months, so Dr. Zaius then has $10200 \\cdot 1.025 = \\boxed{10455}$ dollars."
