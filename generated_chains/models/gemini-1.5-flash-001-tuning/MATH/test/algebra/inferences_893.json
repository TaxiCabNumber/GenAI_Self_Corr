At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n = 11$, then what is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot 2^{2n}$?",

        "ground_truth": "By simplifying exponents, we have $2^{2n} = 4^n$.  So, our overall expression is $\\frac{4^n}{4^{n+1}}$.  This simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.  Throughout the course of this calculation, we did not have to plug in the value of 11 for $n$, but the answer may be similarly obtained with this substitution."
