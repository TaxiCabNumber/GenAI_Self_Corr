At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "In order for $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression inside the square root in the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must not be 0. So we have the two conditions $2x-6\\ge0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 3$ and $x-3 \\ne 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ne 3$. We see that $x=\\boxed{4}$ is the smallest integer value that satisfies both conditions."
