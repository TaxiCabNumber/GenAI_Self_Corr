        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $c$ will the circle with equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 + 4y + c = 0$ have a radius of length 3?",
        "inference": "To find the radius of the circle, we need to rewrite the equation in standard form. We do this by completing the square:\n\n$(x^2 + 8x) + (y^2 + 4y) = -c$\n\n$(x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 + 4y + 4) = -c + 16 + 4$\n\n$(x + 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 20 - c$\n\nNow the equation is in standard form, $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. \n\nWe are given that the radius is 3, so $r^2 = 9$. Therefore:\n\n$20 - c = 9$\n\n$c = 11$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square gives us $(x + 4)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 20 - c$. Since we want the radius to be 3, we must have $20 - c = 3^2$. It follows that $c = \\boxed{11}$."
