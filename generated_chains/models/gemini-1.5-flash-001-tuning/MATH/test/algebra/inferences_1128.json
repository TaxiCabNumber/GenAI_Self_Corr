We multiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction, then rearrange terms: $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This can be factored as $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$. We could also use the quadratic formula to find $x$: $$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we find that $x = 1$ or $x = -2$. Since we want the smallest value of $x$, our answer is $\\boxed{-2}$."
