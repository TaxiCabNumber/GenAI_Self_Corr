At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking by a classroom, Linda sees two perfect squares written on a blackboard.  She notices that their difference is her favorite number, 99.  She also notices that there are exactly two other perfect squares between them.  What is the sum of the two perfect squares on the blackboard?",
        "inference": "Let the two perfect squares be $x^2$ and $y^2$, where $x^2$ is the larger of the two.  Since there are two other perfect squares between $x^2$ and $y^2$, we have $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) = 99$.  We know that $x - y = 2$ (since there are two perfect squares between $x^2$ and $y^2$), so $x + y = 99/2$.  Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get $x = 25$ and $y = 23$.  Therefore, the sum of the two perfect squares is $25^2 + 23^2 = 625 + 529 = 1154$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1154}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We name those two perfect squares on the blackboard $a^2$ and $b^2$. We are given that $a^2-b^2=99$. Factoring, we get $(a-b)(a+b)=99$.\nSince the two perfect squares have two other perfect squares between them, we know that $a-b=3$. Therefore, $a+b=33$. Adding the two equations together, we get $2a=36$. Therefore, $a=18$ and $b=15$. Thus, the sum of the two perfect squares is $a^2+b^2=324+225=\\boxed{549}$."

        "inference": "The provided solution is incorrect. Here's why:\n\nThe difference between consecutive perfect squares increases as the squares get larger.  For example:\n\n* 16 - 9 = 7\n* 25 - 16 = 9\n* 36 - 25 = 11\n\nThe difference between two perfect squares cannot be a constant value like 99.  \n\n**Here's how to approach the problem correctly:**\n\nLet the smaller perfect square be $n^2$. Then the next three perfect squares are $(n+1)^2$, $(n+2)^2$, and $(n+3)^2$.  We want the difference between the largest and smallest of these to be 99.\n\nSo we have:\n\n$(n+3)^2 - n^2 = 99$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$n^2 + 6n + 9 - n^2 = 99$\n$6n + 9 = 99$\n$6n = 90$\n$n = 15$\n\nThe largest of the four perfect squares is $(n+3)^2 = 18^2 = 324$ \n\nThe smallest of the four perfect squares is $n^2 = 15^2 = 225$\n\nThe sum of these two perfect squares is $324 + 225 = 549$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{549}$.
