At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. What is the smallest of the even integers?",
        "inference": "Let the first even integer be $x$.  Then the five consecutive even integers are $x$, $x+2$, $x+4$, $x+6$, and $x+8$.  Their sum is $5x+20$.\n\nThe first 8 odd counting numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Their sum is $8\\cdot 9=72$.  We are told that the sum of the five consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers, so $5x+20=72-4$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=\\boxed{10}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first 8 odd positive integers are 1, 3, $\\dots$, 15.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so their sum is $(1 + 15)/2 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nLet the 5 consecutive even integers be $a$, $a + 2$, $a + 4$, $a + 6$, and $a + 8$.  Their sum is $5a + 20$.  But this is also $64 - 4 = 60$, so $5a + 20 = 60$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\boxed{8}$."
