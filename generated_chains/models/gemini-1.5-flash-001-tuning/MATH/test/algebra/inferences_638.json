        "inference": "Solution:\n$42^2=(40+2)^2=40^2+2(40)(2)+2^2=1600+160+4=1764$\nEmily mentally figures the value of $40^2$ and adds $164$ to calculate $42^2$. Thus, she adds $2(40)(2)+2^2=164$.\n\nSimilarly, she can calculate $38^2$ as follows:\n$38^2=(40-2)^2=40^2-2(40)(2)+2^2=1600-160+4=1444$\n\nTherefore, Emily subtracts $2(40)(2)+2^2=\\boxed{164}$ from $40^2$ to calculate $38^2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{164}$.

        "ground_truth": "We see that $38^2 = (40 - 2)^2 = 40^2 - 4\\cdot 40 +4 = 40^2 - 156$. Therefore, Emily subtracts $\\boxed{156}$."
