        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.  Then he answered $80-x$ questions incorrectly.  We can set up the equation $5x-2(80-x)=232$.  Simplifying the equation, we get $7x-160=232$.  Adding $160$ to both sides, we get $7x=392$.  Dividing both sides by $7$, we get $x=56$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly."
