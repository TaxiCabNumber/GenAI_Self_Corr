        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEric and Charles each think of a quadratic polynomial. To their surprise, both quadratics start $x^2+4x+\\cdots$. The ratio of the discriminant, $b^2-4ac$, of Eric's polynomial to the discriminant of Charles's polynomial is equal to the ratio of Charles's constant term to Eric's constant term. If their constant terms are not equal, find the sum of the constant terms.",
        "inference": "Let Eric's quadratic be $x^2+4x+e$ and Charles's quadratic be $x^2+4x+c$.  The discriminants are $4^2-4e=16-4e$ and $4^2-4c=16-4c$.  We are given that $\\frac{16-4e}{16-4c}=\\frac{c}{e}$, which simplifies to $16e-4e^2=16c-4c^2$.  Rearranging, we get $4c^2-4e^2-16c+16e=0$.  Factoring by grouping, we have $4(c^2-e^2)-16(c-e)=0$, or $4(c-e)(c+e)-16(c-e)=0$.  Since $c$ and $e$ are not equal, we can divide both sides by $c-e$, leaving us with $4(c+e)-16=0$.
