At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA certain organism begins as two cells. Each cell splits and becomes two cells at the end of three days. At the end of another three days, every cell of the organism splits and becomes two cells. This process lasts for a total of 15 days, and no cells die during this time. How many cells are there at the end of the $15^\\text{th}$ day?",
