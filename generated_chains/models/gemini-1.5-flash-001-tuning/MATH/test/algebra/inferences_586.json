At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of the first and the third terms of an arithmetic sequence is $5$. If all terms of the sequence are positive integers, what is the fourth term?",

Since all the terms in the sequence are positive integers, the common difference must be nonnegative, so the first term is 1, and the third term is 5.\n\nThen the second term is the average of the first term (namely 1) and the third term (namely 5), or $(1 + 5)/2 = 3$.  Therefore, the common difference is $3 - 1 = 2$, and the fourth term is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$."
