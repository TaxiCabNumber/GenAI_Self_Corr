        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of the constant $a$ does the system of equations below have infinitely many solutions?  \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\ 6x &= 16 + a - 15y \\end{align*}",
        "inference": "Rearranging the second equation, we get $6x + 15y = 16 + a$.  We want this equation to be a multiple of the first equation.  Dividing both sides of the second equation by 3, we get $2x + 5y = \\frac{16 + a}{3}$.  Thus, we want $\\frac{16 + a}{3} = -8$.  Solving for $a$, we find $a = -40$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-40}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Putting the $x$ and $y$ terms of the second equation on the left gives $6x+15y = 16+a$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives $6x + 15y = -24$.  So, our system now is \\begin{align*} 6x+15y &= -24,\\\\ 6x + 15y&=16+a. \\end{align*}This system has infinitely many solutions only if the two right sides are the same, which would make the two equations the same.  So, we must have $-24 = 16+a$, so $a= \\boxed{-40}$."
