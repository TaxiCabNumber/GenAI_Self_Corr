At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what negative value of $k$ is there exactly one solution to the system of equations \\begin{align*}\ny &= 2x^2 + kx + 6 \\\\\ny &= -x + 4?\n\\end{align*}",
        "inference": "To have exactly one solution, the two graphs must intersect at exactly one point.  This means the quadratic and the linear equation must be tangent.  We can find the $x$-coordinate of the point of tangency by setting the two equations equal to each other: \\begin{align*}\n2x^2 + kx + 6 &= -x + 4 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 &= 0.\n\\end{align*} For the graphs to be tangent, this quadratic must have a double root.

        "ground_truth": "Setting the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other, it follows that $2x^2 + kx + 6 = -x + 4$. Re-arranging, $2x^2 + (k+1)x + 2 = 0$. For there to be exactly one solution for $x$, then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero. Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so $k+1 = \\pm 4$. Taking the negative value, $k = \\boxed{-5}$."
