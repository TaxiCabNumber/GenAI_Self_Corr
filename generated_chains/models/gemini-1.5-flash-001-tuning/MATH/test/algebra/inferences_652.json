I hope it is correct.'\nThe parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ and vertex $(h,k)$ is reflected about the line $y=k$. This results in the parabola with equation $y=dx^2+ex+f$. In terms of $k$, what is the value of $a+b+c+d+e+f$?",

Notice that $f(x)+g(x)=2k$. Since $f(1)=a+b+c$ and $g(1)=d+e+f$, we have $a+b+c+d+e+f=f(1)+g(1)=\\boxed{2k}$."
