At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the parabola defined by the equation $y=-(x+1)^2+1$ is shifted 1 unit to the right, then shifted 5 units down, then rotated 180 degrees about its vertex. The resulting parabola has zeros at $x=a$ and $x=b$, where $b\\ge a$. What is $b-a$?",

Shifting this last parabola 5 units down changes its equation to $y=-x^2-4$. Rotating it by 180 degrees changes its equation to $y=x^2-4$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=x^2-4$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=x^2-4$. Factoring the right hand side, we get $0=(x-2)(x+2)$, so either $x-2=0\\Rightarrow x=2$ or $x+2=0 \\Rightarrow x=-2$. Thus, $a=-2$ and $b=2$, so $b-a=\\boxed{4}$."
