Squaring the distance formula, we want to minimize  \\[d^2 = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9\\right)^2.\\]Let $f(x) = x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9\\right)^2$.  Then  \\[f'(x) = 2x + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2-9\\right)x = x^3 - 16x.\\]Setting this equal to 0, we get  \\[x(x^2-16) = 0.\\]This gives us $x=0$ or $x=\\pm 4$.  We can see that $f(0) = 81$ and $f(4) = f(-4) = 64$.  Thus, the minimum distance is $\\sqrt{64} = 8$, and $a^2 = \\boxed{64}$.",

In general, minimization problems like this require calculus, but one optimization method that sometimes works is to try to complete the square.  Pulling out a factor of $\\frac{1}{4}$ from under the radical, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4x^2+x^4-36x^2+324}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^4-32x^2+256)+68} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(x^2-16)^2+68}\n\\end{align*}This last expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, that is, when $x^2=16$. Then the distance is $\\frac{\\sqrt{68}}{2}=\\sqrt{17}$.  Hence the desired answer is $\\sqrt{17}^2 = \\boxed{17}$."
