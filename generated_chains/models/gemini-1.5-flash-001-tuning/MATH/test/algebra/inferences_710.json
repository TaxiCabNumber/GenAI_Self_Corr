I hope it is correct.'\nDr. Jones lives in a country with a progressive tax system. That is, he does not pay any taxes on the first $\\$20{,}000$ in income he makes, he pays $5\\%$ taxes on the next $\\$25{,}000$, he pays $10\\%$ taxes on the next $\\$35{,}000$, he pays $15\\%$ on the next $\\$50{,}000$, and he pays $20\\%$ on every additional dollar onwards. If Dr. Jones pays $\\$10{,}000$ in taxes, then how much income does he make?",
