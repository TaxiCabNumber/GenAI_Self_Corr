        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that $f(y) = f^{-1}(y)$ implies $f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 0$. While it's true that $f(y) = f^{-1}(y)$, this doesn't directly lead to that conclusion.  \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe are given $f(f(x)) = x$.  Let $y = f(x)$. Then $x = f^{-1}(y)$. Substituting into the given equation, we get\n\\[f(y) = f^{-1}(y).\\]Since $y = f(x)$, we can rewrite this as\n\\[f(f(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)).\\]But $f(f(x)) = x$, so $x = f^{-1}(f(x))$. This tells us that $f^{-1}$ undoes the effect of $f$, which means $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.  Therefore, $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$, and we have\n\\[f(f(x)) - f^{-1}(f(x)) = \\boxed{0}.\\]",
