        "inference": "To find the product of the $y$-coordinates of all the solutions, we need to find the $y$ values that satisfy both equations simultaneously.  We can do this by substituting the first equation into the second equation:\n\n$(x^2-8)^2 = -5x+44$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$x^4-16x^2+64=-5x+44$\n\nRearranging, we have:\n\n$x^4-16x^2+5x+20=0$\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which can be difficult to solve directly.

Notice that the equation has a factor of $(x-2)$:\n\n$(x-2)(x^3+2x^2-12x-10) = 0$\n\nThe cubic factor is a bit more challenging, but we can use the Rational Root Theorem to find a rational root.  The Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root of this cubic must be a divisor of $-10$ (the constant term) divided by a divisor of $1$ (the coefficient of the leading term).  Trying the divisors of $-10$, we find that $x=-1$ is a root.  This means that $(x+1)$ is a factor of the cubic:\n\n$(x-2)(x+1)(x^2+x-10) = 0$\n\nThe quadratic factor can be factored further:\n\n$(x-2)(x+1)(x+4)(x-2.5) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = 2$, $x = -1$, $x = -4$, and $x = 2.5$.  \n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into either of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$ values.
