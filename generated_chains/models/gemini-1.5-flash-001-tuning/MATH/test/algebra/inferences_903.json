At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Lauren was born on January 1, 1990, her grandparents put $\\$1000$ in a savings account in her name. The account earned $7.5\\%$ annual interest compounded quarterly every three months. To the nearest dollar, how much money was in her account when she turned two?",

        "ground_truth": "The annual interest rate is 7.5 percent, so each quarter, the investment is compounded at the rate of $7.5/4 = 1.875$ percent.  In two years, there are eight quarters, so the investment will have grown to $1000 \\cdot 1.01875^8 = \\boxed{1160}$, to the nearest dollar."
