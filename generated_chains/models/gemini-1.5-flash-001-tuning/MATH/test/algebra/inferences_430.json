At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA line is drawn through the points $(-2, 6)$ and $(-4, -2)$. What is the $y$-coordinate of the point where this line intersects the $y$-axis?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{14}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we can find the slope of the line through these two points.  The slope will be equal to: $$\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{-2-6}{-4-(-2)}=\\frac{-8}{-2}=4$$ Therefore, the line will have the form $y=4x+b$.  To solve for $b$, substitute in one of the given points for $x$ and $y$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n6&=4(-2)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=-8+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 14&=b\n\\end{align*} Since $b$ in a line of the form $y=mx+b$ is the $y$-intercept, and this is what we are trying to find, the answer is $\\boxed{14}$."
