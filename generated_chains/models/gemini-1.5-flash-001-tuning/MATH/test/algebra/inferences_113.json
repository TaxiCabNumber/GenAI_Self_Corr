        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nExpress $0.6\\overline{333}$ as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.6\\overline{333}$.  Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x = 6.\\overline{333}$.  Multiplying both sides by 100, we get $100x = 63.\\overline{333}$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get\n\\[90x = 57.\\]Then $x = \\frac{57}{90} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Instead of solving it algebraically, notice that this decimal is simply $\\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{18}{30} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{30}}$."
