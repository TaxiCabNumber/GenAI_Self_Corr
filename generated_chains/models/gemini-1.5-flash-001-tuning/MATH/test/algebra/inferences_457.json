At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn an equation of the form $k = ax^2 + bx + c$ with $a > 0$, the least possible value of $k$ occurs at $x = -b/(2a)$. In the equation $k = (6x + 12)(x - 8)$, what is the least possible value for $k$?",

Then the graph of this equation is a parabola opening upward, with a minimum at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic equation is located at the point where $x = -b/(2a)$.
