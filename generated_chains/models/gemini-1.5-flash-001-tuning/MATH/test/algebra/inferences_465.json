At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the first term of an arithmetic sequence equals the third minus the second, and the fourth term is $8$, what is the first term?",
        "inference": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.  Then the second term is $a+d$, the third term is $a+2d$, and the fourth term is $a+3d$.  We are given that $a = (a+2d)-(a+d)$, and $a+3d=8$.  Simplifying the first equation, we get $a=d$.  Substituting into the second equation, we get $d+3d=8$, so $d=2$.  Therefore, $a=d=\\boxed{2}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  We told that the first term is equal to the third term minus the second term, so the first term is equal to $d$.  Then the second term is equal to $2d$, the third term is equal to $3d$, and the fourth term is equal to $4d = 8$.  Hence, the first term is $d = \\boxed{2}$."
