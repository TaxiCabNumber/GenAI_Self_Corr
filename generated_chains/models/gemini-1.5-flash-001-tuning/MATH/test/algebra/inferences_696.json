        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBelow is a drawing of all $26$ letters in the English alphabet. As drawn below, some of these letters could be portions of the graph of a function, and some cannot. For example, the $\\textsf{O}$ resembles an ellipse, which cannot be part of the graph of a function.\n\nAs drawn below, which of these letters could be portions of the graph of a function? (You may not rotate them.)\n\nGive your answer as a list of letters with no spaces or other punctuation between them, in alphabetic order.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c c c c c}\n\\textsf{A} & \\textsf{B} & \\textsf{C} & \\textsf{D} & \\textsf{E}\\\\\\\\\n\\textsf{F} & \\textsf{G} & \\textsf{H} & \\textsf{I} & \\textsf{J}\\\\\\\\\n\\textsf{K} & \\textsf{L} & \\textsf{M} & \\textsf{N} & \\textsf{O}\\\\\\\\\n\\textsf{P} & \\textsf{Q} & \\textsf{R} & \\textsf{S} & \\textsf{T}\\\\\\\\\n\\textsf{U} & \\textsf{V} & \\textsf{W} & \\textsf{X} & \\textsf{Y}\\\\\\\\\n&& \\textsf{Z} &&\n\\end{array}$$",
