At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Solving for $b$, we find that $b=\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging this into the second equation above, we obtain $a=3\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$. Hence $3a=3\\cdot \\frac{3}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}$."
