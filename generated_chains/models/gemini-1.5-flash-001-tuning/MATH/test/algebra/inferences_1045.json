        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a total of 20 quarters stacked in four piles. The first pile has 3 fewer than the second pile. The second pile has 2 more than the third pile. The fourth pile has twice as many as the second pile. How many quarters are in the fourth pile?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{16}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-3\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+2\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=2b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/2$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-2$. Since $b=d/2$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/2-2$. We can substitute $b=d/2$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/2-3$. Substituting $b=d/2$, $c=d/2-2$, and $a=d/2-3$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/2-3)+d/2+(d/2-2)+d=20$, so $d=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ quarters in the fourth pile."
