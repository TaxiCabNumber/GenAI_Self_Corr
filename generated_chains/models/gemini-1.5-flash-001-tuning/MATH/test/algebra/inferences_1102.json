At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMasha has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+1$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Masha is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2-63$. What is $b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe expansion of the quadratic $(x+m)^2-63$ is $x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 63$. We know that this is equal to $x^2 + bx + 1$, so $2m = b$ and $m^2 - 63 = 1$. Solving for $m$ in the second equation gives us $m^2 = 64$, so $m = 8$ (since $m$ is positive). Therefore, $b = 2m = 2 \\cdot 8 = 16$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2-63$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2-63$, which has a constant term of $m^2-63$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2-63 = 1$, which yields the possibilities $m=8$ and $m=-8$.\n\nIf $m=8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2+16x+1$. If $m=-8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2-16x+1$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+16x+1$, giving $b=\\boxed{16}$."
