At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, and four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, how many cupcakes can Bob buy for the price of eighteen cookies?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* **Step 1:**  Find the cost of one cookie in terms of brownies.  Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then 1 cookie costs the same as 2/6 = 1/3 of a brownie. \n* **Step 2:** Find the cost of one brownie in terms of cupcakes. Since 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then 1 brownie costs the same as 10/4 = 2.5 cupcakes.\n* **Step 3:** Find the cost of one cookie in terms of cupcakes. Since 1 cookie is equal to 1/3 of a brownie, and 1 brownie is equal to 2.5 cupcakes, then 1 cookie is equal to (1/3) * 2.5 = 5/6 of a cupcake.\n* **Step 4:** Determine how many cupcakes eighteen cookies would buy. Since 1 cookie is equal to 5/6 of a cupcake, then 18 cookies are equal to 18 * (5/6) = 15 cupcakes.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{15}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes."
