At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first term of an arithmetic sequence is $2$. The sum of the third and the sixth terms is $25$. What is the fourth term?",

        "ground_truth": "Call the difference between two consecutive terms $x$. The third term is then $2+2x$, and the sixth term is $2+5x$. So, $25 = (2+2x) + (2+5x)$. Solving for $x$ gives $7x = 21$, or $x = 3$. So, the fourth term is $2 + 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{11}$."
