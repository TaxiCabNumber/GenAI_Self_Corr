At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPositive integers $x$ and $y$ have a product of 56 and $x < y$. Seven times the reciprocal of the smaller integer plus 14 times the reciprocal of the larger integer equals 4.
