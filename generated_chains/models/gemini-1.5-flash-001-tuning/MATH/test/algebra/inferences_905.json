The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series is $\\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$, so we have the equations \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{5}{2}(2a+4d)&=70,\\\\\n\\frac{10}{2}(2a+9d)&=210.\n\\end{align*}Simplifying, we get \\begin{align*}\n5a+10d&=70,\\\\\n10a+45d&=210.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $-2$, we get $-10a-20d=-140$.  Adding this to the second equation, we get $25d=70$, so $d=2.8$.  Substituting this into the first equation, we get $5a+28=70$, so $a=8.4$.  Therefore, the first term is $\\boxed{8.4}$.

The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.
