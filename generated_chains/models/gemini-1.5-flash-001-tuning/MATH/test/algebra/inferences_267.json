At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe points $(-3,2)$ and $(-2,3)$ lie on a circle whose center is on the $x$-axis. What is the radius of the circle?",
        "inference": "Let the center of the circle be $(c,0)$. Since $(-3,2)$ and $(-2,3)$ lie on the circle, the distances from the center to these points are equal. Thus, we have the equation \\[\\sqrt{(c + 3)^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{(c + 2)^2 + 3^2}.\\]Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get $(c + 3)^2 + 4 = (c + 2)^2 + 9$. Expanding, we get $c^2 + 6c + 9 + 4 = c^2 + 4c + 4 + 9$. Simplifying, we get $2c = 0$, so $c = 0$. Thus, the center of the circle is $(0,0)$, and the radius of the circle is the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(-3,2)$, which is $\\sqrt{(-3 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{13}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
