        "inference": "The error in the solution is that the parabola is not of the form $x = ay^2 + by + c$. Instead, it is of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nSince the parabola intersects the $x$-axis at $(3,0)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0,-1)$, we know that $c = -1$ (the y-intercept) and $9a + 3b + c = 0$ (substituting $x = 3, y = 0$).\n\nWe also know that the vertex of the parabola is at $(1,-1)$. Since the parabola is symmetric about its vertex, the x-coordinate of the vertex is the average of the x-coordinates of the points where the parabola intersects the x-axis.  Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{3 + 1}{2} = 2$.  This contradicts the given information that the vertex is at $(1,-1)$.  Therefore, there is no parabola that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nSince there is no solution, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{no solution}}$. \n",
