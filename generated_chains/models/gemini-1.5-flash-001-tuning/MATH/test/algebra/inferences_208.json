        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence?",
        "inference": "Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ form an arithmetic sequence, we can write $b = a + d$ and $c = a + 2d$ for some integer $d$.  The perimeter is 60, so $a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) = 60$.  This simplifies to $3a + 3d = 60$, or $a + d = 20$.\n\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are side lengths of a triangle, they must satisfy the Triangle Inequality.  This gives us three inequalities:\n\n* $a + (a + d) > a + 2d$  (This simplifies to $a > d$.)\n* $a + (a + 2d) > a + d$ (This simplifies to $a + d > 0$.)\n* $(a + d) + (a + 2d) > a$  (This simplifies to $a + 3d > 0$.)\n\nThe second and third inequalities are always satisfied since $a$ and $d$ are positive integers.  The first inequality tells us that $a > d$.\n\nSince $a + d = 20$, the possible values of $a$ are 11, 12, $\\dots$, 19.  This gives us $\\boxed{9}$ distinct triangles. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles."
