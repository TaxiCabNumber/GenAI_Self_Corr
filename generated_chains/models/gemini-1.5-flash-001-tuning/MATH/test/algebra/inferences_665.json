At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$.",
        "inference": "The distance from the origin to a point $(x,y)$ is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.  Substituting $y=x^2-5$, we get the distance to be $\\sqrt{x^2+(x^2-5)^2}=\\sqrt{x^4-9x^2+25}$.  We want to minimize this distance.  Let $f(x)=x^4-9x^2+25$.  Then $f'(x)=4x^3-18x=2x(2x^2-9)$.  This is zero when $x=0$ or $x=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$.  Since $f''(x)=12x^2-18$, $f''(0)=-18<0$, so $f$ has a local maximum at $x=0$.  Also, $f''\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)=27>0$ and $f''\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)=27>0$, so $f$ has local minima at $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$.  Since $f(x)$ goes to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity, the global minimum of $f(x)$ occurs at $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$.  We can take $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$, so the minimum distance is $\\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^4-9\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^2+25}=\\sqrt{\\frac{81}{16}-\\frac{81}{2}+25}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16}}=\\frac{1}{4}$.  The answer is $a+b=1+4=\\boxed{5}$.",
        "ground_truth": "By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\\pm 3/\\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\\sqrt{25-\\frac{81}{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\\boxed{21}$."

        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that the global minimum of $f(x)$ corresponds to the minimum distance. The function $f(x)$ represents the square of the distance, not the distance itself.  To minimize the distance, we need to minimize $\\sqrt{f(x)}$.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe have already found that $f(x)$ has local minima at $x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$.  Since $f(x)$ goes to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity, the global minimum of $f(x)$ occurs at $x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance is \n\\[\\sqrt{f\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^4 - 9 \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{2}}\\right)^2 + 25} = \\sqrt{\\frac{81}{16} - \\frac{81}{2} + 25} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16}} = \\frac{1}{4}.\\]The answer is $a + b = 1 + 4 = \\boxed{5}$. \n",
