At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $3^{x + y} = 81$ and $81^{x - y} = 3,$ then what is the value of the product $xy$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "We can write $81$ as $3^4$, so $3^{x + y} = 3^4$. Equating exponents, we have $x + y = 4$.  Similarly, $81^{x - y} = (3^4)^{x - y} = 3^{4(x - y)} = 3^1$, so $4(x - y) = 1$.  Solving the system of equations $x + y = 4$ and $4x - 4y = 1$, we find $x = \\frac{17}{8}$ and $y = \\frac{15}{8}$, so $xy = \\frac{17}{8} \\cdot \\frac{15}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{64}}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $81 = 3^4$, then $3 = 81^{1/4}$. Comparing exponents, it follows that we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 4 \\\\\nx -y &= 1/4.\n\\end{align*} Summing the two equations yields that $2x = 4+1/4 = 17/4$, so $x = 17/8$. Subtracting the two equations yields that $2y = 4-1/4 = 15/4$, so $y = 15/8$. Thus, $xy = \\frac{17}{8} \\cdot \\frac{15}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{255}{64}}$."

        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that $81^{x-y} = 3^1$. The problem statement doesn't specify that $81^{x-y}$ equals any particular value.  Therefore, we cannot solve for $x$ and $y$ directly. \n\nThe problem likely intended to provide an equation relating $81^{x-y}$ to some other expression.
