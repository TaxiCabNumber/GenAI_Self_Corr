        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $P=(a,b)$ be the point of intersection of the line $y=2x-10$ and the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$.  Compute $a+b$.",
        "inference": "The slope of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{0-8}{9-7}=-4$, so the equation of this line is of the form $y=-4x+c$.  Substituting $(7,8)$, we get $8=-28+c$, so $c=36$.  Thus, the equation of the line is $y=-4x+36$.\n\nTo find the point of intersection of $y=2x-10$ and $y=-4x+36$, we set the right-hand sides equal to each other: $2x-10=-4x+36$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x=8$.  Substituting into $y=2x-10$, we find $y=6$.  Therefore, $a+b=8+6=\\boxed{14}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The slope of the line through $(7,8)$ and $(9,0)$ is $\\frac{8-0}{7-9}=\\frac{8}{-2}=-4$.  Thus, the line has equation $y=-4x+b$ for some $b$.  Since $B(9,0)$ lies on this line, we have $0=-4(9)+b \\Rightarrow b=36$, and thus the equation of the line is $y=-4x+36$.\n\nTo determine the point of intersection between the lines having equations $y=-4x+36$ and $y=2x-10$, we set the two expressions for $y$ equal to each other and solve for $x$.  We have $-4x+36=2x-10 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{23}{3}$.  It follows that  $y=2x-10=2\\left(\\frac{23}{3}\\right)-10 = \\frac{46}{3}-\\frac{30}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$.\n\nThus, $P=(\\frac{23}{3},\\frac{16}{3})$ and $a+b=\\frac{23}{3}+\\frac{16}{3}=\\frac{39}{3}=\\boxed{13}$."
