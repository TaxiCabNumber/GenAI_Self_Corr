        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct rectangles are there with integer side lengths such that the numerical value of area of the rectangle in square units is equal to $5$ times the numerical value of the perimeter in units? (Two rectangles are considered to be distinct if they are not congruent.)",
        "inference": "Let the length of the rectangle be $l$ units and the width be $w$ units. We are given that $lw=5(2l+2w)$. Simplifying this equation gives us $lw=10l+10w$, or $lw-10l-10w=0$. Adding 100 to both sides, we get $lw-10l-10w+100=100$, which factors as $(l-10)(w-10)=100$. Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, we need to find all the pairs of integers that multiply to 100. These pairs are $(1,100)$, $(2,50)$, $(4,25)$, $(5,20)$, $(10,10)$, $(20,5)$, $(25,4)$, $(50,2)$, and $(100,1)$. Note that we need to include the pair $(10,10)$ because it represents a square, which is also a rectangle. Excluding the cases where $l=w$, there are $\\boxed{8}$ distinct rectangles. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property."
