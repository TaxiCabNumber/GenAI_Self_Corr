At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the error in the measurement of a particle's momentum and the error in the measurement of a particle's position must be at least Planck's constant divided by $4\\pi$. Suppose the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved. By how many percent does the minimum error in the measurement of its position increase?",
