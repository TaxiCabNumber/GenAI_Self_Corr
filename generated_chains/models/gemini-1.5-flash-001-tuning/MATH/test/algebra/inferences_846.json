        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what ordered pair $(a,b)$ are there infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to the system \\begin{align*}\n3ax+3y&=5b,\\\\\n2x+y&=5.\n\\end{align*}",
        "inference": "To have infinitely many solutions, the two equations must represent the same line.  This means they must be scalar multiples of each other.  Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get $6x+3y=15$.  For the first equation to be a scalar multiple of this, we must have $3a=6$ and $5b=15$.  Solving, we find $a=2$ and $b=3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(2,3)}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is three times that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 3. This implies that the first equation must be $3(2x+y)=3(5)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $3a=3\\cdot2$ and $5b=3\\cdot5$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(2,3)}$."

        "inference": "The solution is correct.  The error was in the statement \"For the first equation to be a scalar multiple of this, we must have $3a=6$ and $5b=15$.\"  This is true, but it is not the only condition for the equations to represent the same line.  The constant terms must also be proportional.  Since the second equation has a constant term of 5, and we are multiplying it by 3, the first equation must have a constant term of 15.  This means $2a+5b=15$.  Solving the system of equations $3a=6$ and $2a+5b=15$, we find $a=2$ and $b=3$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(2,3)}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
