        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $j$, $k$, and $l$ are positive with $jk=24$, $jl = 48$, and $kl=18$, find $j+k+l$.",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nMultiplying the equations together, we get $(jkl)^2=24\\cdot48\\cdot18$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we find $jkl=144$.  Dividing this equation by each of the original equations, we find $l=6$, $k=4$, and $j=3$.  Therefore, $j+k+l=3+4+6=\\boxed{13}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since $$j=\\frac{24}{k}=\\frac{48}{l}$$we have $l = 2k$. So $18\n= 2k^2$, which means that $9 = k^2$. Since $k$ has to be positive, this implies that $k = 3$. This means that $j = 8$, and $l = 6$. Hence $j+k+l = \\boxed{17}$.\n\nOR\n\nTake the product of the equations to get $jk\\cdot jl\n\\cdot kl = 24 \\cdot 48 \\cdot 18$. Thus $$(jkl)^2 = 20736.$$So $(jkl)^2 =\n(144)^2$, and we have $jkl = 144$. Therefore, $$j = \\frac{jkl}{kl} = \\frac{144}{18} = 8.$$From this it follows that $k=3$ and $l=6$, so the sum is $8+3+6=\\boxed{17}$."
