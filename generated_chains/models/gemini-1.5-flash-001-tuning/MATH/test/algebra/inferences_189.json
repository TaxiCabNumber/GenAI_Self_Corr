        "inference": "Let the roots of the quadratic equation be $r$ and $s$.  Then we have $r - s = |b - 2c|$, and by Vieta's formulas, $r + s = -b$ and $rs = c$.  Squaring the equation $r - s = |b - 2c|$, we get\n\\[r^2 - 2rs + s^2 = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2.\\]Then $(r + s)^2 - 4rs = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$, so $(-b)^2 - 4c = b^2 - 4bc + 4c^2$.  This simplifies to $4c^2 - 4bc + 4c = 0$, or $c^2 - bc + c = 0$.  Factoring, we get $c(c - b + 1) = 0$.  Since $c \\neq 0$, $c - b + 1 = 0$, so $c = \\boxed{b - 1}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{b - 1}$.

        "ground_truth": "By the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}, \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}$. The difference of these is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}$. Setting this equal to $|b - 2c|$, it follows that (after squaring) $b^2 - 4c = (b-2c)^2 = b^2 + 4c^2 - 4bc$. Thus $$0 = 4c^2 + 4c - 4bc = 4c(c - b + 1).$$As $c \\neq 0$, it follows that $c = \\boxed{b - 1}$."
