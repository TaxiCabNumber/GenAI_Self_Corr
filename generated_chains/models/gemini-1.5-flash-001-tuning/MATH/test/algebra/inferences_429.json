At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNew York and Denver are in different time zones.  When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver.  A train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time) and arrives in Denver 45 hours later.  What time is it in Denver when the train arrives?",
