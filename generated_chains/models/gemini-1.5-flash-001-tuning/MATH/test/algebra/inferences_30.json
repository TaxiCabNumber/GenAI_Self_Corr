        "inference": "Let $x$ be the cost of one pound of feathers and $y$ be the cost of one ounce of gold. \n\nWe are given the following system of equations:\n\n$8x + \\frac{1}{2}y = 932$\n\n$14x + \\frac{3}{2}y = 1402$\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -1, we get:\n\n$24x + \\frac{3}{2}y = 2796$\n\n$-14x - \\frac{3}{2}y = -1402$\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\n$10x = 1394$\n\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n\n$x = 139.4$\n\nSubstituting $x=139.4$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$8(139.4) + \\frac{1}{2}y = 932$\n\n$1115.2 + \\frac{1}{2}y = 932$\n\nSubtracting 1115.2 from both sides, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}y = -183.2$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$y = -366.4$\n\nSince the cost of gold cannot be negative, we must have made an error in our calculations.  Let's go back and check our work.  Notice that the coefficient of $y$ in the second equation is $\\frac{3}{2}$, while the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  This suggests that we should have multiplied the first equation by 3 and the second equation by -2 to eliminate $y$.\n\nLet's try that again.  Multiplying the first equation by 3, we get:\n\n$24x + \\frac{3}{2}y = 2796$\n\nMultiplying the second equation by -2, we get:\n\n$-28x - 3y = -2804$\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\n$-4x = -10.8$\n\nDividing both sides by -4, we get:\n\n$x = 2.7$\n\nSubstituting $x=2.7$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$8(2.7) + \\frac{1}{2}y = 932$\n\n$21.6 + \\frac{1}{2}y = 932$\n\nSubtracting 21.6 from both sides, we get:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}y = 910.4$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\n$y = 1820.8$\n\nNow we can find the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold:\n\n$5(2.7) + 5(1820.8) = 13.5 + 9104 = 9117.5$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$9117.50}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $f$ be the cost of a pound of feathers and $g$ the cost of an ounce of gold.  We have \\begin{align*}\n8f+2g&=932 \\\\\n14f+3g&=1402\n\\end{align*}Solving the first equation for $g$ we get $g=466-4f$.  Substituting into the second equation, we solve \\[\n14f+3(466-4f)=1402\n\\]to find $f=2$.  Substituting into $g=466-4f$ we have $g=458$.  Thus five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold costs $5(f+g)=\\boxed{2300}$ dollars."
