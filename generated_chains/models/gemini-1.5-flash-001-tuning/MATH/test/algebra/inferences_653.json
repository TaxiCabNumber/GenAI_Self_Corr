        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30 bricks per hour. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the two of them placed a total of 600 bricks. How many bricks did David lay?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of hours David worked. Then Alan worked $3x$ hours. \n\nDavid laid $30x$ bricks and Alan laid $30(3x)=90x$ bricks. \n\nTogether they laid $30x+90x=120x$ bricks. \n\nWe know they laid a total of 600 bricks, so $120x=600$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we find $x=5$.  David worked for 5 hours, and laid $30(5)=150$ bricks. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks."
