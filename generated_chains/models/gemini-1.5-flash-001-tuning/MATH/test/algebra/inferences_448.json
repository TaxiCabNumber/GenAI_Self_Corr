To find the shortest distance between the circles, we draw a segment connecting their centers, and subtract off the radii of the two circles. The distance between the centers of the circles is $\\sqrt{(9-(-6))^2 + (5-(-3))^2} = \\sqrt{15^2+8^2} = 17$. So the shortest distance between the circles is $17 - 2.5 - 7 = \\boxed{7.5}$."
