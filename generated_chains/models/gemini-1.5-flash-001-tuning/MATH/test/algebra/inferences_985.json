        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt's a well-known physics formula that force equals mass times acceleration.  Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball.  If the softball has a mass of $200$ g and the baseball has a mass of $150$ g, what is the ratio of acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's?  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "Let $a_J$ be the acceleration of Jen's ball and $a_B$ be the acceleration of Jack's ball. Since the force is the same, we have $200a_J=150a_B$.  Dividing both sides by $150a_J$ gives $\\frac{a_J}{a_B}=\\frac{150}{200}=\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $j_1$ is the acceleration of Jen's ball and $j_2$ is the acceleration of Jack's ball, then we have $$j_1 \\cdot 200 = j_2 \\cdot 150\\qquad \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{j_1}{j_2} = \\boxed{\\frac 34}.$$"
