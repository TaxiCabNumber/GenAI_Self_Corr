        "inference": "The error is that the solution assumes the quadratic is in the form $x^2 + ax + b = 0$. However, the problem does not specify this. We need to consider the general form of a quadratic: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet the roots of the quadratic be $r$ and $s$. By Vieta's formulas:\n\n* $r + s = -\\frac{b}{a}$\n* $rs = \\frac{c}{a}$\n\nWe are given that $r + s = -a$ and $rs = b$.  Therefore:\n\n* $-\\frac{b}{a} = -a$\n* $\\frac{c}{a} = b$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $b = a^2$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $\\frac{c}{a} = a^2$, which simplifies to $c = a^3$.\n\nThus, the quadratic is $ax^2 + a^2x + a^3 = 0$. We can factor out an $a$: $a(x^2 + ax + a^2) = 0$. Since $a$ is nonzero, we have $x^2 + ax + a^2 = 0$.\n\nThe problem asks for the values of $(a,b)$. We found $b = a^2$, so the final answer is:\n\n\\\\boxed{(a, a^2)} \n",
