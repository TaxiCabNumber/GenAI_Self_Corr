        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBecause of redistricting, Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students. This is an increase of $4\\%$ over last year's enrollment. What was last year's enrollment?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be last year's enrollment.  An increase of $4\\%$ means the current enrollment is $104\\%$ of last year's enrollment.  This can be written as the equation $1.04x=598$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $1.04$ gives $x=\\frac{598}{1.04}=575$.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{575}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If we knew last year's enrollment at Liberty Middle School, we would multiply by $1.04$ to get the new enrollment of $598$ students. Working backward, we can divide $598$ by $1.04$ to get $\\boxed{575\\text{ students}}$. Alternatively, we could solve the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment."
