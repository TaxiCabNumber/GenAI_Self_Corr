        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOhm's law states that $V=IR$ for a simple circuit, where $V$ is the total voltage, $I$ is the amount of current running through the resistor and $R$ is the resistance of the resistor. If $I=40$ amperes when $R=3$ ohms, find the amount of current (in amperes) when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms. Assume voltage remains constant.",
        "inference": "First, we can find the voltage by using Ohm's law with the given values of $I$ and $R$. Substituting $I=40$ amperes and $R=3$ ohms into $V=IR$, we find $V=40\\cdot 3=120$ volts.\n\nWe now know that the voltage is 120 volts. We can use Ohm's law again to find the current when the resistance is 20 ohms. Plugging $V=120$ volts and $R=20$ ohms into $V=IR$, we get $120=I\\cdot 20$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 20 gives us $I=120/20=6$ amperes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If $V=IR$ for a constant voltage $V$, then the total voltage of the circuit can be expressed as $V=(40)(3)=120$. Thus, when the resistance $R$ is $20$ ohms, the equation becomes: \\begin{align*} 120& =(I)(20)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad I& =\\frac{120}{20}\n\\\\ I& =\\boxed{6}\n\\end{align*}"
