        "inference": "Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$.  We are given that $ab - a - b = 39$.  Adding 1 to both sides, we get $ab - a - b + 1 = 40$, which factors as $(a - 1)(b - 1) = 40$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, $a - 1$ and $b - 1$ must also be relatively prime.  The only way to factor 40 into two relatively prime factors is $40 = 8 \\cdot 5$.
