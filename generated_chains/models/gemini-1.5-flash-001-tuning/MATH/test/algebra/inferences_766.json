        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy baseball team won $2/9$ of its games this season.  If we lost 15 more games than we won, how many games did we play this year?",
        "inference": "Let $w$ be the number of games we won.  Then we lost $w+15$ games.  Since we played $w + (w+15) = 2w+15$ games, we know that $\\frac{w}{2w+15} = \\frac{2}{9}$.  Cross-multiplying gives $9w = 4w + 30$, so $5w = 30$ and $w=6$.  Therefore, we played $2w + 15 = 2(6) + 15 = \\boxed{27}$ games. Final Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose we played $x$ games.  Since we won $2/9$ of the games we played, we won $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. Therefore, we lost $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games.  Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we have \\[\\frac{7x}{9} - \\frac{2x}{9} = 15.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5x/9 = 15$, and solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{27}$ games played."
