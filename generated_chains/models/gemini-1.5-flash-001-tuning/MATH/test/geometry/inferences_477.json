        "inference": "Let the original degree measure of the arc be $x$ and the original radius of the circle be $r$.  The original arc length is $\\frac{x}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r$.  The new degree measure is $1.2x$ and the new radius is $1.25r$, so the new arc length is $\\frac{1.2x}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi (1.25r) = 1.5 \\cdot \\frac{x}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r$.
