At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(2,5)$ and $B(10,5)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The diameter of the circle is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10 - 2 = 8$ units.  The radius of the circle is half the diameter, or 4 units.  The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (4^2) = \\boxed{16\\pi}$ square units. Final Answer: $\\boxed{16\\pi}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We could use the distance formula, but since $A$ and $B$ have the same $y$-coordinate, we can see that the distance between them is $10 - 2 = 8$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of 8, the radius must have length 4. Therefore, the answer is $4^2\\pi = \\boxed{16\\pi}$."
