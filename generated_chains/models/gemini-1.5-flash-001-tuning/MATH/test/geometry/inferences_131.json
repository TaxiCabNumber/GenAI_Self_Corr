At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo right circular cylinders have equal volume. The first cylinder has a radius of 6 inches and a height of 12 inches. What is the number of inches in the height of the second cylinder if its radius is 8 inches? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
