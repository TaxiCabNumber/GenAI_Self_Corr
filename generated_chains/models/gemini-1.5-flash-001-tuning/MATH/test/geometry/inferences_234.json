At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn isosceles trapezoid has sides of length 4 cm, 10 cm, 16 cm and 10 cm. What is the area of this trapezoid, in square centimeters?",

The remaining leg, which is the height of the trapezoid, is thus 8.\n\nTherefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{4 + 16}{2}\\cdot 8 = \\boxed{80}$ square centimeters."
