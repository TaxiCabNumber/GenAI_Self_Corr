At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nP.J. has a cylindrical mug with a 3-inch diameter. His mug is filled to a height of 6 inches with grape juice. Schuyler has a cylindrical mug with a 4-inch diameter. To what height in inches must Schuyler's mug be filled so that he receives the same amount of juice as P.J.? Express your answer as a mixed number.",

        "ground_truth": "P.J.'s juice fills up a cylinder with radius 3/2 inches and height 6 inches; his juice has volume $\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2(6)= \\frac{27\\pi}{2}$ cubic inches.\n\nSchuyler's juice fills up a cylinder with radius 2 inches and unknown height $h$ inches; his juice has volume $\\pi (2^2) (h) = 4\\pi h$ cubic inches.  Setting this equal to P.J.'s volume and solving for $h$ yields $\\frac{27\\pi}{2} = 4\\pi h \\Rightarrow h = \\frac{27}{8}= \\boxed{3 \\frac{3}{8}}$ inches."
