        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\nLet's break down why:\n\n* **Understanding Medians:** Medians of a triangle are lines drawn from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. In this problem,  AM and CN are medians.\n* **Centroid:** The point where the three medians of a triangle intersect is called the centroid. In this problem, point P is the centroid. \n* **Centroid Property:** A fundamental property of the centroid is that it divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. This means CP:PN = 2:1.\n\nThe solution correctly applies this property to find CP. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is  $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$. \n",
