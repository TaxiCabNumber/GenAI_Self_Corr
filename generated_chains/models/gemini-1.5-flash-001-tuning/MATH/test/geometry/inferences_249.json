        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\\%$ without altering the volume, by what percent must the height be decreased?",
        "inference": "Let the original radius of the jar be $r$ and the original height be $h$. The original volume is $\\pi r^2 h$. \n\nIncreasing the diameter by 25% increases the radius by 25%, so the new radius is $1.25r$.  Let the new height be $h'$.  Since the volume remains the same, we have $\\pi (1.25r)^2 h' = \\pi r^2 h$.  Simplifying, we get $1.5625h' = h$.  Therefore, $h' = \\frac{h}{1.5625} = 0.64h$.  This means the height must be decreased by $1 - 0.64 = 0.36 = \\boxed{36\\%}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r, h,$ and $V$, respectively, be the radius, height, and volume of the jar that is currently being used. The new jar will have a radius of $1.25r$ and volume $V$. Let $H$ be the height of the new jar. Then \\[\n\\pi r^{2} h = V = \\pi (1.25r)^{2} H,\\] so \\[\n\\frac{H}{h}=\\frac{1}{(1.25)^{2}}= 0.64.\n\\] Thus $H$ is $64\\%$ of $h$, so the height must be reduced by $(100 - 64)\\% = \\boxed{36} \\%$."
