This divides the trapezoid into a rectangle and two congruent right triangles.  Each of the right triangles has hypotenuse 13 units long and side length $(17-7)/2=5$ units long.  Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is $\\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$ units.  The area of the $12\\times 7$ rectangle is 84 square units, and the collective area of the two triangles is $2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 12=60$ square units.  The area of the trapezoid is $84+60=\\boxed{144}$ square units."
