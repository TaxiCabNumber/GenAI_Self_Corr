        "inference": "Let the radius of the cylinder be $r$ inches and the height be $h$ inches.  The lateral surface area is $2\\pi rh$, and the volume is $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n2\\pi rh &= 24\\pi, \\\\\n\\pi r^2 h &= 24\\pi.\n\\end{align*} Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get  \\[\\frac{\\pi r^2 h}{2\\pi rh} = \\frac{24\\pi}{24\\pi}.\\] This simplifies to $\\frac{r}{2} = 1$, so $r = \\boxed{2}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the radius and height of the cylinder measure $r$ and $h$ inches respectively.  From the lateral surface area and volume values, we set up the equations \\[2\\pi r h = 24\\pi\\]  and \\[\\pi r^2 h = 24\\pi.\\] These equations simplify to $rh = 12$ and $r^2 h = 24$; it follows that $r = (r^2h)/(rh)=24/12=\\boxed{2}$ inches."
