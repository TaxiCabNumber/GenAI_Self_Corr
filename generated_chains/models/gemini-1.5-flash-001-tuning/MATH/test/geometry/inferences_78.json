At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has leg lengths of 8 and 15 units. What is the length, in units, of the median to the hypotenuse? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{8^2+15^2}=\\sqrt{289}=17$ units, so the length of the median is $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$ units. Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{2}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
