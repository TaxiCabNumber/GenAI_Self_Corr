        "inference": "The error in the solution is that the hypotenuse of the right triangle is not a side of the octagon. Instead, the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the square formed by four of the octagon's sides.\n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nLet $s$ be the length of a side of the octagon.  Then the diagonal of the square formed by four of the octagon's sides has length $s\\sqrt{2}$.  This diagonal is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $s$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $s^2 + s^2 = (s\\sqrt{2})^2$, so $2s^2 = 2s^2$.  This equation is true for all values of $s$, so we need to find another relationship between $s$ and the given side length of 10 inches.\n\nNotice that the side length of 10 inches is the sum of two octagon side lengths and the diagonal of the square formed by four of the octagon's sides.  Therefore, we have the equation $10 = s + s + s\\sqrt{2}$.  Solving for $s$, we find $s = \\frac{10}{2 + \\sqrt{2}}$.  Rationalizing the denominator, we get $s = \\frac{10(2 - \\sqrt{2})}{(2 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{20 - 10\\sqrt{2}}{4 - 2} = 10 - 5\\sqrt{2}$.
