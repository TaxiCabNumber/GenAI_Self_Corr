At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nElliott Farms has a silo for storage. The silo is a right circular cylinder topped by a right circular cone, both having the same radius. The height of the cone is half the height of the cylinder. The diameter of the base of the silo is 10 meters and the height of the entire silo is 27 meters. What is the volume, in cubic meters, of the silo? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,18)--(5,27)--(10,18)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,-1)..(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)..(5,1)..(10,0),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,17)..(10,18),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,18)..(5,19)..(10,18),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((15,27)--(16,27),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15,0)--(16,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,27)--(15.5,16),linewidth(1));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,11),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"27 meters\",(15.5,13.5));\n\n[/asy]",
