Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The length of the arc on circle $A$ is $\\frac{55}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r_A = \\frac{11}{72} \\pi r_A$.  The length of the arc on circle $B$ is $\\frac{40}{360} \\cdot 2 \\pi r_B = \\frac{1}{9} \\pi r_B$.

Thus, for the same arc length, the arc angle is inversely proportional to the radius, so the ratio of the radius of circle $A$ to the radius of circle $B$ is $40:55$, or $8:11$. Since the ratio of the areas of two circles is the square of the ratio of their radii, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $(8/11)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$."

        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\nThe error you might be thinking of is that the question doesn't specify that the arcs are *corresponding* arcs.  However, the solution doesn't assume that.  It only uses the fact that the arc lengths are equal.  \n\n**Therefore, the solution is correct, and the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{64}{121}}$.** \n",
