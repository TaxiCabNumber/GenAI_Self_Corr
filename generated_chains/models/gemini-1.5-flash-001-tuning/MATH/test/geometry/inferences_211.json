        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRight $\\Delta ABC$ has legs measuring 8 cm and 15 cm. The triangle is rotated about one of its legs. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the maximum possible volume of the resulting solid? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "Rotating the triangle about a leg will create a cone.  The maximum volume of the cone is achieved when the hypotenuse is the diameter of the base of the cone.  The hypotenuse of this triangle has length $\\sqrt{8^2 + 15^2} = 17$, so the radius of the cone's base is $\\frac{17}{2}$. The height of the cone is the length of the leg that the triangle is rotated about, which is either 8 or 15. The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$, so the maximum possible volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left( \\frac{17}{2} \\right)^2 \\cdot 15 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{289}{4} \\cdot 15 = \\frac{1445}{4} \\pi.\\] Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1445}{4} \\pi}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the triangle is rotated about the shorter leg, then the radius is the longer leg and the height is the shorter leg, and the volume is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot (15^2\\pi)(8) = 600\\pi\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\] If the triangle is rotated about the longer leg, then the radius is the shorter leg and the height is the longer leg, and the volume is $\\frac13(8^2\\pi)(15)$, which is $\\frac{8}{15}$ of the volume we found earlier.  So, the maximum possible volume is $\\boxed{600\\pi}$ cubic centimeters."
