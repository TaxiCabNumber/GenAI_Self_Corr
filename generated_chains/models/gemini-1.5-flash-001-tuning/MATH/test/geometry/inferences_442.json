        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a sector of a circle is the sum of the two sides formed by the radii and the length of the included arc. A sector of a particular circle has a perimeter of 28 cm and an area of 49 sq cm. What is the length of the arc of this sector?",
        "inference": "Let the radius of the circle be $r$ and the central angle of the sector be $\\theta$ (in radians).  Then the perimeter of the sector is $2r + r\\theta = 28$, and the area of the sector is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\theta = 49$.\n\nFrom the perimeter equation, we have $r\\theta = 28 - 2r$.  Substituting this into the area equation, we get $\\frac{1}{2}r(28 - 2r) = 49$.  Simplifying, we get $14r - r^2 = 49$, or $r^2 - 14r + 49 = 0$.  This factors as $(r - 7)^2 = 0$, so $r = 7$.\n\nSubstituting $r = 7$ into the equation $r\\theta = 28 - 2r$, we get $7\\theta = 14$, so $\\theta = 2$.  The length of the arc is then $r\\theta = 7 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{14}$ cm. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the arc of this sector be $s$ cm and the radius of the circle be $r$ cm.  Then this sector is $s/2\\pi r$ of a full circle, and its area is $\\frac{s}{2\\pi r}\\cdot \\pi r^2 = \\frac{rs}{2} = 49$ square cm.  Also, we compute the sector's perimeter to be $2r + s = 28$ cm.  Solving, we find that $s = \\boxed{14}$ cm."
