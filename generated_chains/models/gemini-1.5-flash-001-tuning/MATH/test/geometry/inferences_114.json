At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right circular cylinder with radius 2 inches and height 1 inch has the same volume as a second right circular cylinder. The radius of the second cylinder is 1 inch. How many inches are in the height of the second cylinder?",
