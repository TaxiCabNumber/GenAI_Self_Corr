At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the radius, in inches, of a right circular cylinder if its lateral surface area is $3.5$ square inches and its volume is $3.5$ cubic inches?",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the radius of the cylinder and $h$ be the height of the cylinder.  The lateral surface area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$, and the volume of a cylinder is $\\pi r^2 h$.  We are given that $2\\pi rh = 3.5$ and $\\pi r^2 h = 3.5$.  Dividing the first equation by the second equation, we get\n\\[\\frac{2\\pi rh}{\\pi r^2 h} = \\frac{3.5}{3.5}.\\]This simplifies to $\\frac{2}{r} = 1$, so $r = \\boxed{2}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the radius be $r$ and the height be $h$. Since the lateral surface area is 3.5 square inches, we have $2\\pi rh=3.5$. Since the volume is 3.5 cubic inches, we have $\\pi r^2h=3.5$. Dividing the latter equation by the former, we find that $r=\\boxed{2}$ inches."
