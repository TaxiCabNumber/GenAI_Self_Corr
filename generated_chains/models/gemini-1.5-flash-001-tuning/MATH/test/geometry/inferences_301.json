        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKendra has an unlimited supply of unbreakable sticks of length 2, 4 and 6 inches. Using these sticks, how many non-congruent triangles can she make if each side is made with a whole stick? Two sticks can be joined only at a vertex of the triangle. (A triangle with sides of lengths 4, 6, 6 is an example of one such triangle to be included, whereas a triangle with sides of lengths 2, 2, 4 should not be included.)",

        "ground_truth": "To start, we can make three equilateral triangles, with sides $2,2,2$, $4,4,4$ and $6,6,6$.  Next, look at isosceles triangles.  If two sides have length 6, the remaining side could be $2$ since $6+2>6$ and $6+6>2$.  The remaining side could also be 4 since $6+4>6$ and $6+6>4$.  So, this is two more triangles.  If two sides have length 4, the remaining side could have length $6$ since $6+4>4$ and $4+4>6$.  The remaining side could also have length 2 since $2+4>4$ and $4+4>2$.  There are no possible triangles with all sides of different length, since $2+4=6$.  Thus, there are a total of $\\boxed{7}$ non congruent triangles."
