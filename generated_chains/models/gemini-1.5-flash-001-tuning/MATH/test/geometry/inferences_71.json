        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular right pyramid has a square base, and each edge of the pyramid is four inches long. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic inches? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "The base of the pyramid is a square with side length 4 inches. The area of the square base is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ square inches.  The height of the pyramid is the length of the altitude from the apex to the center of the base.  This altitude is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg of length 2 inches (half the side length of the base) and the other leg of length $\\sqrt{4^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{12}=2\\sqrt{3}$ inches.  Therefore, the height of the pyramid is $\\sqrt{2^2+(2\\sqrt{3})^2}=\\sqrt{16}=4$ inches.  The volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\text{area of the base}\\cdot\\text{height}=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 16\\cdot 4=\\frac{64}{3}$.  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is approximately $21.33$ cubic inches. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21.33}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The base has area $B=4\\cdot 4=16.$  The length of the segment connecting a vertex of the base to the center of the base equals $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2}=2\\sqrt{2}.$   This segment and the altitude of the pyramid form a right triangle with hypotenuse of length $4$.  Thus we have $h=\\sqrt{4^2-(2\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{8}$.  By the volume formula for a pyramid, we have $V=Bh/3=16\\sqrt{8}/3\\approx \\boxed{15.08}$ cubic inches."
