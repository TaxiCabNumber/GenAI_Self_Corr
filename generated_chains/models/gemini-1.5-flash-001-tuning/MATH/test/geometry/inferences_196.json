        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo nonadjacent vertices of a rectangle are $(4,3)$ and $(-4,-3),$ and the other two vertices have integer coordinates. How many rectangles satisfy these conditions?",
        "inference": "The center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the segment connecting $(4,3)$ and $(-4,-3)$, which is $(0,0)$.  Since the other two vertices have integer coordinates, they must lie on the lattice points of the lines $x = 4$ and $x = -4$.  There are 7 lattice points on each of these lines, but we must exclude the points $(4,3)$ and $(-4,-3)$.  This gives us $6 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}$ possible rectangles. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rectangle are of the same length and bisect each other.  The diagonal determined by the two given points has its midpoint at $(0, 0),$ and it has length \\[\\sqrt{(4-(-4))^2 + (3-(-3))^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = 10.\\]Thus, the other diagonal must have its midpoint at $(0, 0)$ and also have length $10.$ This means that the other two vertices of the rectangle must lie on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 5^2.$ The number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) on this circle is $12$: we have \\[(\\pm 4, \\pm 3), (\\pm 3, \\pm 4), (\\pm 5, 0), (0, \\pm 5).\\]These points pair up to give $6$ possible diagonals, of which $1$ is the given diagonal. Therefore, there are $6-1=5$ choices for the other diagonal, which uniquely determines a rectangle. Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ possible rectangles."
