Dividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\n$DC^2 - DC - 20 = 0$.  Factoring the quadratic, we get:\n\n$(DC - 5)(DC + 4) = 0$.  Therefore, $DC = 5$ or $DC = -4$.  Since $DC$ must be a positive length, we have $DC = 5$.\n\nFinally, we can find $AC$:\n\n$AC = 3DC = 3(5) = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
