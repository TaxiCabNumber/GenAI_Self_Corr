        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)",
        "inference": "Let the radius of the sphere (and the cone) be $r$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$, where $h$ is the height of the cone.  Since the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream, we have \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h = \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.\\] Solving for $h$, we get $h = 3r$.  Therefore, the ratio of the cone's height to its radius is $h/r = \\boxed{3}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius  of the sphere and cone, and let $h$ be the height of the cone. Then the conditions of the problem imply that $$\n\\frac{3}{4} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^{2}h, \\quad \\text{so}\\quad\n\\ h = 3r.\n$$ Therefore, the ratio of $h$ to $r$ is $\\boxed{3:1}$."
