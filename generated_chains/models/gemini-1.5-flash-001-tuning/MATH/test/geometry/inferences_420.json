        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe side lengths of a right triangle measure $x$, $x + y$ and $x - y$ units where $0 < y < x$. What is the value of $y \\div x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have  \\[(x + y)^2 = (x - y)^2 + x^2.\\]Expanding, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 + x^2$.  Simplifying, we get $4xy = x^2$, so $y = \\frac{x}{4}$.  Hence, $\\frac{y}{x} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Clearly $x+y$ is the largest of $x, x+y,x-y$, and this value is thus the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.  By the Pythagorean theorem, we see that $x^2 + \\left(x-y\\right)^2 = \\left(x+y\\right)^2$.  Dividing through by $x^2$, we find that $1 + \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2$.\n\nRearranging and factoring a difference of squares, we obtain $1 = 2 \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{y}{x}\\right)$.  Thus we see that $y \\div x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the triangle is a right triangle, which is not stated in the problem.  Therefore, we cannot apply the Pythagorean Theorem.  \n\nThe solution cannot be corrected without further information about the triangle. \n",
