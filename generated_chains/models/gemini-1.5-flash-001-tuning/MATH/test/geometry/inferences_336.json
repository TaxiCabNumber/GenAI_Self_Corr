At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the measures of the angles of the trapezoid be $60^\\circ$, $60^\\circ + d$, $60^\\circ + 2d$, and $60^\\circ + 3d$, where $d$ is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is $360^\\circ$, so\n\\[60^\\circ + (60^\\circ + d) + (60^\\circ + 2d) + (60^\\circ + 3d) = 360^\\circ.\\]This simplifies to $6d = 120^\\circ$, so $d = 20^\\circ$.  The largest angle measures $60^\\circ + 3d = 60^\\circ + 3(20^\\circ) = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$. The four angles of the trapezoid are $60$, $60+d$, $60+2d$, and $60+3d$. Since the interior angles in a trapezoid add up to equal 360 degrees, we have the equation $60+(60+d)+(60+2d)+(60+3d)=360\\Rightarrow d=20$. Thus, the largest angle in the trapezoid is $60+3\\cdot20=\\boxed{120}$ degrees."
