I hope it is correct.'\nA company makes a six-sided hollow aluminum container in the shape of a rectangular prism as shown. The container is $10^{''}$ by $10^{''}$ by $12^{''}$. Aluminum costs $\\$0.05$ per square inch. What is the cost, in dollars, of the aluminum used to make one container?\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ndraw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)--(0,0,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((1,0,0)--(1,0,-1)--(1,1,-1)--(1,1,0)--(1,0,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((0,1,0)--(1,1,0)--(1,1,-1)--(0,1,-1)--(0,1,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"$12^{''}$\",(1,0,-.5),W);\n\nlabel(\"$10^{''}$\",(.5,0,0),N);\n\nlabel(\"$10^{''}$\",(0,.5,0),N);\n\n[/asy]",

        "ground_truth": "The amount of aluminum used is equal to the surface area of the container. The horizontal faces have area $10\\cdot10=100$ square inches. The vertical faces have area $12\\cdot10=120$ square inches. Thus, the total surface area is $2\\cdot100+4\\cdot120=680$ square inches.

        "inference": "The solution correctly calculates the surface area of the container, but fails to account for the fact that the top and bottom of the container are not made of aluminum.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\n* **Area of the sides:** 2 * 10\" * 12\" = 240 square inches\n* **Area of one end:** 10\" * 12\" = 120 square inches\n* **Total area of aluminum:** 240 square inches + 120 square inches = 360 square inches\n* **Cost:** 360 square inches * $0.05/square inch = $18\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\$18}$.
