To find the area of the triangle, we look for information about the triangle.  Because angle $ACB$ intersects $180^\\circ$ of the circle, we know $m\\angle ACB=\\frac{180^\\circ}2=90^\\circ$, so triangle $ACB$ is a right triangle.  What's more, since $AB=4$ and $BC=2$, it follows that $AC=2\\sqrt{3}$ and the area of right triangle $ACB$ equals $\\frac{2\\cdot2\\sqrt{3}}2=2\\sqrt{3}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{4\\pi - 2\\sqrt{3}}$."
