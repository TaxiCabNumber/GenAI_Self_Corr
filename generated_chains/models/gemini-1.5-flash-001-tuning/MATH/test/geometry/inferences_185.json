If the surface area of the cylinder is $112\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, what is the radius of the cylinder in centimeters?",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the radius of the cylinder and $h$ be the height.  We are given that $h = 2.5r$.  The surface area of the cylinder is $2\\pi rh + 2\\pi r^2 = 112\\pi$.  Substituting $h = 2.5r$, we get $2\\pi r(2.5r) + 2\\pi r^2 = 112\\pi$.  Simplifying, we get $7\\pi r^2 = 112\\pi$, so $r^2 = 16$.  Therefore, $r = 4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$.
