        "inference": "The solution is correct. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* The problem involves a right triangle with sides 5, 12, and 13.  This is a Pythagorean triple, confirming it's a right triangle.\n* The incenter is the center of the inscribed circle, and the circumcenter is the center of the circumscribed circle. \n* In a right triangle, the incenter lies on the midpoint of the hypotenuse, which is also the median to the hypotenuse. The circumcenter lies on the midpoint of the hypotenuse as well. \n* The inradius is calculated as (a + b - c)/2, where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle. This gives us an inradius of 2.\n* The circumradius of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse, which is 6.5.\n* Therefore, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is the difference between the circumradius and the inradius: 6.5 - 2 = 4.5.\n\n**Final solution:** \\\\boxed{$\\frac{9}{2}$} \n",
