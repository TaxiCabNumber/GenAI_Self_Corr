        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe largest interior angle in an isosceles trapezoid is 4 times the measure of the smallest interior angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle in the trapezoid?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of the smallest interior angle.  The largest interior angle has measure $4x$.  The two base angles of the trapezoid are congruent, and the sum of the four angles is $360^\\circ$.  So we have the equation $x+4x+2x=360^\\circ$, which simplifies to $7x=360^\\circ$.  Dividing both sides by 7, we find $x=\\boxed{51\\frac{3}{7}^\\circ}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{51\\frac{3}{7}^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The interior angles of a trapezoid consist of two pairs of congruent angles.  Therefore, if the smaller angle measure is $x$ and the larger angle measure is $4x$, then the measures of the four angles are $x$, $x$, $4x$, and $4x$.  Summing these measures and setting the result equal to $360$ degrees, we find $10x=360^\\circ\\implies x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
