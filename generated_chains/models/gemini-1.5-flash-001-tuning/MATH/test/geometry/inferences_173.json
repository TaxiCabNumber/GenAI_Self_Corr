The ratio of the area of the larger of the two regions into which the chord divides the circle to the smaller can be expressed in the form $\\displaystyle\n{{a\\pi+b\\sqrt{c}}\\over{d\\pi-e\\sqrt{f}}}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are positive integers, $a$ and $e$ are relatively prime, and neither $c$ nor $f$ is divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the remainder when the product $a\\cdot\nb\\cdot c\\cdot d\\cdot e\\cdot f$ is divided by 1000.",
        "inference": "Let the radius of the circle be $r$. Since the chord bisects the radius, the distance from the center of the circle to the chord is $r/2$.

The area of the smaller semicircle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi\\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{8}\\pi r^2$.

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the chord divides the circle into a semicircle and a \"half-moon\" shape. This is not the case. The chord actually divides the circle into two segments, each bounded by the chord and an arc of the circle. \n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $AB$ be the chord that bisects the radius.  Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$, and let $OM$ be the perpendicular from the center to the chord.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, O, M;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(110);\nB = dir(70);\nM = (A + B)/2;\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(O--M);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, SW);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $AB$ bisects the radius, $OM = r/2$.  Also, triangle $OAM$ is a right triangle, so by the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\\[AM = \\sqrt{OA^2 - OM^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} r.\\]Then $AB = 2 \\cdot AM = \\sqrt{3} r$.\n\nThe area of sector $OAB$ is $\\frac{1}{6} \\pi r^2$, since $\\angle AOB = 120^\\circ$.  The area of triangle $OAB$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot OM = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} r \\cdot \\frac{r}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2$.  Therefore, the area of segment $AB$ is\n\\[\\frac{1}{6} \\pi r^2 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} r^2 = \\frac{1}{12} (\\pi - 3 \\sqrt{3}) r^2.\\]Since the circle is divided into two equal segments, the ratio of the larger area to the smaller area is 1.  This ratio can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{1}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{0}$. \n",
