        "inference": "The error lies in the setup of the system of equations.  The ratio should be set up as follows:\n\n$$\\frac{3x}{4(90-x)} : \\frac{1}{2}(180-x) = 3:14:4.$$  This means that the first term, $\\frac{3x}{4(90-x)}$, is proportional to 3, the second term, $\\frac{1}{2}(180-x)$, is proportional to 14, and the third term, $\\frac{1}{2}(180-x)$, is proportional to 4.  This gives us the following system of equations:  \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{3x}{4(90-x)} &= \\frac{3}{14}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}(180-x) &= \\frac{14}{14} = 1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]Solving the second equation, we find $x=160$.  The complement of $\\angle A$ has measure $90-x = 90-160 = \\boxed{-70}$.  However, this is not a valid angle measure.  The problem is flawed. \n",
