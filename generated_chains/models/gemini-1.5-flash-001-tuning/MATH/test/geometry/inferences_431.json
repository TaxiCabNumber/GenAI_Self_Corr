        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the perimeters of two equilateral triangles is $45$ inches, and the area of the larger one is $16$ times the area of the smaller one. What is the area, in square inches, of the larger triangle? Express your answer in the simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the smaller triangle be $s$ and the side length of the larger triangle be $S$.  The perimeters of the triangles are $3s$ and $3S$, so $3s+3S=45$, or $s+S=15$.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $x$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2$, so  \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}S^2 = 16\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2.\\]This simplifies to $S^2=16s^2$, or $S=4s$.\n\nSubstituting into $s+S=15$, we have $s+4s=15$, so $s=3$.  Then $S=4s=12$, and the area of the larger triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}S^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\cdot 12^2 = \\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$ square inches. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We set $a$ as the length of the side of the first triangle and $b$ as the length of the side of the second. We know that the sum of the perimeter is $45$, so $3a+3b=45 \\rightarrow a+b=15$.\n\nWe also know that the area of the second is $16$ times the area of the first, so $b^2=16a^2$. Solving and taking the positive root, we get that $b=4a$. Thus, $a+4a=15 \\rightarrow a=3$. Therefore, the side of the larger triangle $b=4 \\cdot 3 =12$.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the desired area is $\\frac{12^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{4}=\\boxed{36 \\sqrt{3}}$."
