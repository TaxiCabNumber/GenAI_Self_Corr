At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the number of square units in the area of a triangle whose sides measure 5, 5 and 6 units?",

        "ground_truth": "This triangle is isosceles, and so the altitude to the side with length 6 must hit that side at its midpoint. Thus our triangle is divided into two right triangles with hypotenuse $5$ and one side of length $3$. Thus each of these is a $3-4-5$ triangle, and each one has area $\\frac{3 \\times 4}{2} = 6$, for a total area of $\\boxed{12}$."
