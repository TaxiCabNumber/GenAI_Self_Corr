        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids. What is the radius of the can, in inches?",
        "inference": "The label represents the lateral surface area of the cylinder.  The lateral surface area of a cylinder is equal to the circumference of the base times the height.  Let $r$ be the radius of the can, then the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r$.  We have the equation $2\\pi r \\cdot 6 = 60\\pi$, which simplifies to $12\\pi r = 60\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $12\\pi$ gives $r = \\boxed{5}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The surface area of the can excluding the lids is expressed as Circumference $\\times$ Height.  Therefore, since the height is 6 inches, the circumference is $10\\pi$.  Since Circumference $= 2\\pi r$, we have radius = $\\boxed{5\\text{ inches}}$."
