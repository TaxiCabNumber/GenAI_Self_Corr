I hope it is correct.'\nA water-filled spherical balloon lands on a sidewalk, momentarily flattening to a hemisphere.  The ratio of the radius of the spherical balloon to the radius of the hemisphere can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt[3]{a}$ for some real number $a$.  Compute $a$.",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the radius of the spherical balloon and let $R$ be the radius of the hemisphere.  Since the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the hemisphere, we have \\[\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi R^3.\n\\] Solving for $R$, we find \\[\nR = \\sqrt[3]{2}r.\n\\] Thus, the ratio of the radius of the spherical balloon to the radius of the hemisphere is $\\frac{r}{R} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{2}}$.  Therefore, $a = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the radius of the hemisphere be $r$.  The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nLet the radius of the sphere be $x$, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi x^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3.\\]  Simplifying yields $2x^3=r^3$.
