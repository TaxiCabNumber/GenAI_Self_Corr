At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sides of the base of a triangular pyramid are 3, 4 and 5 feet and the altitude is 6 feet. What is the number of cubic feet in the volume of the pyramid?",

        "ground_truth": "Because we have $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, the base of the pyramid is a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4.  Therefore, the area of the base is $3\\cdot 4/2 = 6$ square feet.  The altitude of the pyramid is 6 feet.  The volume of the pyramid is one-third the product of the area of the base and the altitude, which is $6\\cdot 6/3=\\boxed{12}$ cubic feet."
