        "inference": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n* **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the sum of the lengths of the three altitudes of an isosceles triangle with sides of length 10.\n\n* **Visualizing:**  Draw an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 10.  Let the base of the triangle be 12.  Draw the three altitudes (perpendicular lines from each vertex to the opposite side).  You'll notice the altitude from the vertex between the two sides of length 10 will bisect the base, creating two right triangles.\n\n* **Calculations:**\n    * **Altitude from the Vertex:**  This altitude splits the base into two segments of length 6. Using the Pythagorean Theorem on one of the right triangles:  $h^2 = 10^2 - 6^2 = 64$.  Therefore, the altitude from the vertex is 8.\n\n    * **Other Altitudes:** The other two altitudes will be congruent (since the triangle is isosceles). These altitudes will bisect the sides of length 10, creating two right triangles.  Using the Pythagorean Theorem: $h^2 = 10^2 - 5^2 = 75$.  Therefore, each of the other altitudes has length $\\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n* **Sum:** The sum of the altitudes is $8 + 5\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{8 + 10\\sqrt{3}}$. \n",
