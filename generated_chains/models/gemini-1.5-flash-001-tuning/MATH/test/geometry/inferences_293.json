        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe width, length, and height of a rectangular prism are each increased by $10\\%$. What is the percent increase in the volume of the prism? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "Let the original dimensions of the prism be $w$, $l$, and $h$.  Then the original volume is $w\\cdot l\\cdot h$.  After the increase, the dimensions are $1.1w$, $1.1l$, and $1.1h$, so the new volume is $(1.1w)\\cdot(1.1l)\\cdot(1.1h)=1.331w\\cdot l\\cdot h$.  The volume increased by a factor of 1.331, which is a $33.1\\%$ increase.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that increasing a quantity by $p\\%$ is equivalent to multiplying it by $1+p\\%$.   If the original length, width, and height are $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively, then the new length, width, and height are $1.1l$, $1.1w$, and $1.1h$.  Therefore, the new volume is $(1.1l)(1.1w)(1.1h)=(1.1)^3(lwh)=1.331(lwh)$, which is 1.331 times greater than the original volume $lwh$.  Multiplication by 1.331 corresponds to an increase of $33.1\\%$, which to the nearest percent is $\\boxed{33\\%}$.\n\nNote: The identity  \\[\n(1+x)^3=1+3x+3x^2+x^3\n\\] with the substitution $x=0.1$ may be used to quickly calculate $1.1^3$."
