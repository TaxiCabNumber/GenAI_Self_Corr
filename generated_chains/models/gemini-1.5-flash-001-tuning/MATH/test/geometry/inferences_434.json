I hope it is correct.'\nA decorative arrangement of floor tiles forms concentric circles, as shown in the figure to the right. The smallest circle has a radius of 2 feet, and each successive circle has a radius 2 feet longer. All the lines shown intersect at the center and form 12 congruent central angles. What is the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.
