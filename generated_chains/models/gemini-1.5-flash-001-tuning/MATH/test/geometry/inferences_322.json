At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.",
        "inference": "Solution:  The surface area of a sphere is $4\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.  We are given that the surface area is $196\\pi$ square inches, so \\[4\\pi r^2=196\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$, we get $r^2=49$, so $r=7$ inches.  The circumference of a great circle of the sphere is $2\\pi r=2\\pi(7)=\\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches. Final Answer: $\\boxed{14\\pi}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[4\\pi r^2 = 196\\pi.\\] Dividing both sides by $4\\pi$ yields $r^2 = 49$; taking the square root of both sides and keeping the positive solution yields $r=7$ inches.\n\nA great circle of a sphere is the circular cross-section of the sphere that passes through the sphere's center, which, in this case, is a circle with radius 7.  The circumference of this circle is $2\\pi\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{14\\pi}$ inches."
