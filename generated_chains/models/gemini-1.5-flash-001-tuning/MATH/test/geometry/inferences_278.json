At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe circumference of the interior of a cylindrical water glass is $3\\pi$ inches, and its interior height is 4 inches. How many cubic inches of liquid can the glass hold? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
