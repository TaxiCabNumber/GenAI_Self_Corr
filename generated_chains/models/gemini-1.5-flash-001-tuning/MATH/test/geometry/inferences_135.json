        "ground_truth": "By the Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are consecutive integers, we can write $a = b-1$ and $c = b + 1$. Substituting this into the Pythagorean theorem, we get $(b-1)^2 + b^2 = (b+1)^2$. This becomes $b^2 - 2b + 1 + b^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1$, or $b^2 - 4b = 0$. Factoring, we have $b(b-4) = 0$, so $b=0$ or $b=4$. If $b=0$, then $a = b-1 = -1$, which can't happen since $a$ is a length. So $b=4$, and $a=3$, $c=5$.\n\nWe'll now find the area of one shaded right triangle. It is one half times the base times the height. If we use $b$ as the height, then $a$ is the base (since it's a right triangle), so the area is $\\frac{1}{2}ab = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6$. There are four right triangles, so the total shaded area is $4(6) = \\boxed{24}$."
