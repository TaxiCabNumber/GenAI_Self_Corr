The circumference of the circle is $2\\pi(12)=24\\pi$, so the arc length of the sector is $\\frac{1}{6}(24\\pi)=4\\pi$.  The perimeter of the sector is $4\\pi + 12 + 12 = \\boxed{24 + 4\\pi}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "In the diagram, the radius of the sector is 12 so $OA=OB=12$.  Since the angle of the sector is $60^\\circ$, then the sector is $\\dfrac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ}=\\dfrac{1}{6}$ of the total circle. Therefore, arc $AB$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the total circumference of a circle of radius 12, so has length $\\frac{1}{6}(2\\pi(12))=4\\pi$. Therefore, the perimeter of the sector is $12+12+4\\pi=\\boxed{24+4\\pi}$."
