At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ expressed as a fraction in simplest form?",
        "inference": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{05}$. Then $100x = 5.\\overline{05}$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $99x = 5$, so $x = \\frac{5}{99}$.  Therefore, the product is $\\frac{5}{99} \\cdot \\frac{9}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{05}$ to a fraction. Let's define $x=0.\\overline{05}$. If we multiply both sides by $100$ we get $100x=5.\\overline{05}$ so $99x=5$ and $x=0.\\overline{05}=\\frac{5}{99}$. Since $1.8=\\frac{9}{5}$ we get  $$\\frac{\\cancel{5}}{99}\\cdot\\frac{9}{\\cancel{5}}=\\frac{9}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}.$$"
