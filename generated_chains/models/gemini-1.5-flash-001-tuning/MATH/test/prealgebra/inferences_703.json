        "inference": "Let's represent your current age with the variable $x$ and your brother's current age with the variable $y$. We know that $y=4x$. In six years, your brother will be $y+6$ years old, and you will be $x+6$ years old. We also know that in six years, your brother will be twice as old as you will be.  This can be expressed as the equation: $y + 6 = 2(x + 6)$.\n\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\n\n1. $y = 4x$\n2. $y + 6 = 2(x + 6)$\n\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate $y$:\n\n$4x + 6 = 2(x + 6)$\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation:\n\n$4x + 6 = 2x + 12$\n\nSubtracting $2x$ from both sides:\n\n$2x + 6 = 12$\n\nSubtracting $6$ from both sides:\n\n$2x = 6$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$:\n\n$x = 3$\n\nNow that we know your current age is $3$ years old, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find your brother's current age:\n\n$y = 4(3)$\n\n$y = 12$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \\[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \\boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)"
