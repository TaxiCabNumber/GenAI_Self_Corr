I hope it is correct.'\nThe same eight people sit in a certain church pew every week, but not always in the same order. Every week, each person hugs the people immediately to his or her left and right. How many weeks does it take (at a minimum) for every pair of people to hug at least once?",

Since order doesn't matter, the actual number of hugs that must take place is $(8\\cdot 7)/2,$ which is $28.$\n\nEvery week, $7$ different hugs take place, since there are $7$ positions where two people are side-by-side.
