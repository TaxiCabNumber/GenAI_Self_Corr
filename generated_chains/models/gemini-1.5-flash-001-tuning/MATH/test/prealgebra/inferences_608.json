At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA piece of yarn is $60$ cm long. The yarn is cut so that one piece is five times the length of the other piece. How many centimeters long is the shorter piece?",
