At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 1341 can be written as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the largest of these integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$.\n \n We have the equation $x+(x+1)+(x+2)=1341$.\n \n Simplifying the equation, we get $3x+3=1341$.\n \n Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get $3x=1338$.\n \n Dividing both sides by 3, we get $x=446$.\n \n The largest of the three integers is $x+2$, which is $446+2=448$.\n \n Final Answer: $\\boxed{448}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the three integers be $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$.  We have  $$(n-1)+n+(n+1) = 1341,$$ so $3n=1341$, which gives $n=447$.\n\nThe largest of the three numbers is $n+1=\\boxed{448}$."
