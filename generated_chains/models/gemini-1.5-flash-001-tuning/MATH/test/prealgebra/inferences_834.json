At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the angles of a triangle are in a ratio of $3:5:7$. What is the degree measure of the largest angle?",

Since the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $3k+5k+7k=180^\\circ$, which implies $k=180^\\circ/15=12^\\circ$.  The largest angle is $7k=7(12^\\circ)=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
