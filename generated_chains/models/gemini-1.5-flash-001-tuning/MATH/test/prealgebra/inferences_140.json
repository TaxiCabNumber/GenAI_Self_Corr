At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?",

        "ground_truth": "Initially, John has $2a$ pins, where $a$ is the number of pins in each pile. He gives away $\\frac{a}{6}$ pins, so $2a-\\frac{a}{6} = \\frac{11a}{6} = 66$ is the number of pins he has left. We get $a=36$, so he originally had $2a = \\boxed{72}$ pins."
