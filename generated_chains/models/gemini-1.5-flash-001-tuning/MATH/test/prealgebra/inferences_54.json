At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible area, in square centimeters, of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm?",
        "inference": "The largest possible area of a right triangle with given side lengths occurs when the two given sides are the legs of the right triangle.  The area of a right triangle is half the product of its legs, so the largest possible area is $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(20) = \\boxed{120}$ square centimeters. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.\n\nIf the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.\n\nThe largest possible area then is $\\boxed{120}$ square centimeters."
