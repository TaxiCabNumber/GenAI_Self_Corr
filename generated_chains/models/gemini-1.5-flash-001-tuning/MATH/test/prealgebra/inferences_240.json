At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA juice company sells its product in either a 48-ounce size or a 32-ounce size. It charges $\\$3.90$ for the 48-ounce size. How much should it charge for the smaller size if it wants the price per ounce to be $25\\%$ more than the price per ounce of the larger size?",
        "inference": "The price per ounce of the larger size is $\\$3.90/48 = \\$0.08125$.\n\nThe price per ounce of the smaller size should be $1.25(\\$0.08125) = \\$0.1015625$.\n\nThe price of the smaller size should be $\\$0.1015625 \\times 32 \\approx \\$3.25$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$3.25}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We could solve this problem by figuring out the per-ounce cost of the 48-ounce package, increasing it by $25\\%$, and then multiplying that by 32 for the smaller package. However, if we simply increase the price by $25\\%$, and then scale the package size down to 32 ounces from 48 ounces, these are the same calculations, but in a different order that makes it easier to calculate. Thus: $3.90 \\times 1.25 \\times \\frac{32}{48} = \\boxed{3.25\\text{ dollars}}$"
