At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the prime factorization of $109!$, what is the exponent of $3$?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
        "inference": "The exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $109!$ is the number of multiples of 3 in the integers from 1 to 109, plus the number of multiples of $3^2 = 9$, plus the number of multiples of $3^3 = 27$, and so on.\n\nThere are 36 multiples of 3 between 1 and 109 (since $109/3 = 36\\frac{1}{3}$), 12 multiples of 9 (since $109/9 = 12\\frac{1}{9}$), 3 multiples of 27 (since $109/27 = 4\\frac{1}{27}$), and 1 multiple of 81 (since $109/81 = 1\\frac{28}{81}$).\n\nTherefore, the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $109!$ is $36 + 12 + 3 + 1 = \\boxed{52}$.  I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, we check how many of the numbers from $1$ to $109$ are multiples of $3$. We divide $109$ by $3$, and it comes out to be $36$ and a bit. So we know this gives us $36$ times the factor $3$ appears, to begin with.\n\nNow, some numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so they have $3$ as a factor twice, and we've only counted them once so far! There are $12$ multiples of $9$ less than $109$, and we need to add one to our exponent for each of these. That gives another $12$ to the exponent.\n\nSome numbers are also multiples of $3^3=27$. (Horrible, isn't it?) We actually have four such numbers: $27$, $54$, $81$, and $108$. We've counted two $3$s for each of them, so now we need to count one more for each, adding another $4$ to the exponent.\n\nOne more time. What about $3^4=81$? Yes, we do have a multiple of $81$ among our numbers. So we add one more to the exponent, and at last we've gotten all of them.\n\nFinally, we end up with a total of $36+12+4+1=\\boxed{53}$ in the exponent."
