At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the chocolatier, classic chocolate fudge costs 10 dollars a pound. Anna purchases $\\frac{7}{9}$ of a pound of the fudge. The cash register rounds to the nearest cent, or hundredth of a dollar. How many dollars does Anna pay for her fudge?",

Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the hundredths place, which in $7.\\overline{7}$ is 7, up to 8. So, rounding $7.\\overline{7}$ to the nearest hundredth yields $\\boxed{7.78}$ dollars."
