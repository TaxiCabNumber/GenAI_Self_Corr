        "ground_truth": "Based on the histogram, we can make an educated guess that the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast will be around $2$ or $3$ (simply because there are a large number of years for which no hurricanes or only one hurricane reached the east coast). To this end, we begin by calculating the number of years in which three to seven hurricanes reached the east coast: $12 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 21$. There are $5 + 14 = 19$ years in which zero or one hurricanes reached the east coast. Thus, the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast is $\\boxed{2}$."

The median number of hurricanes is the value that divides the data set in half.
