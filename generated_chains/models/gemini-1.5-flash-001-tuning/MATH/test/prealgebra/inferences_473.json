        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 15. Four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger number. What is the larger number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the larger number and $y$ be the smaller number.\n\nWe are given the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}\nx+y = 15 \\\\\n4y = 2x-60\n\\end{cases}$$\n\nSolving for $x$ in the first equation, we get:\n\n$$x=15-y$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$4y = 2(15-y)-60$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$4y = 30-2y-60$$\n\n$$6y=-30$$\n\n$$y=-5$$\n\nSubstituting $y=-5$ back into the equation $x=15-y$, we get:\n\n$$x=15-(-5)$$\n\n$$x=20$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $y$ be the larger of the numbers.  Since the numbers sum to 15, the other number is $15-y$.   Since four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger, we have: \\begin{align*}\n4(15-y)&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n60-4y&=2y-60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n120&=6y\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20&=y.\n\\end{align*} The larger number is $\\boxed{20}$, which makes the smaller number -5. We can check that our answer is correct by plugging the values into the original problem. We get $-5+20=15$ and $4(-5)=2(20)-60$, which result in $15=15$ and $-20=-20$."
