        "inference": "The error lies in the assumption that $80$ is not a divisor of itself. Every number is a divisor of itself.\n\nThe correct solution is to find the smallest product of two distinct divisors of 80 that is *not* a divisor of 80. We already found that $2\\cdot40 = 80$ is a divisor of 80.  The next smallest product is $4\\cdot5 = 20$.  Since 20 is a divisor of 80, we move on to the next smallest product, which is $4\\cdot10 = 40$.  This is also a divisor of 80.  The next smallest product is $4\\cdot20 = 80$, which is again a divisor of 80.  The next smallest product is $5\\cdot8 = 40$, which is a divisor of 80.  The next smallest product is $5\\cdot10 = 50$.  This is not a divisor of 80, so the answer is $\\boxed{50}$. \n",
