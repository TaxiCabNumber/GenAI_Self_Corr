At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lengths of two opposite sides of a square are decreased by $40\\%$ while the lengths of the other two sides are increased by $50\\%$ to form a rectangle. By what percent does the square's area decrease?",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the square be $s$.  The area of the square is $s^2$.\n\nThe lengths of two opposite sides of the square are decreased by $40\\%$, so their length is now $0.6s$.  The lengths of the other two sides of the square are increased by $50\\%$, so their length is now $1.5s$.  The area of the rectangle is $(0.6s)(1.5s) = 0.9s^2$.\n\nThe area of the square decreased by $s^2 - 0.9s^2 = 0.1s^2$.  This is a decrease of $\\frac{0.1s^2}{s^2} = 0.1 = \\boxed{10\\%}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{10\\%}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $A$ be the area of the square. The lengths of one pair of opposite sides was decreased by $40\\%$, so the area became $.6A$. The other pair of sides were increased by $50\\%$, so the area became $1.5\\cdot .6 A = .9A$. Thus, the area decreased by $\\boxed{10}$ percent."
