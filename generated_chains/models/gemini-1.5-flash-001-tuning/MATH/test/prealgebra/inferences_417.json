At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 numbers from the set $1-15$ in the first column, 5 numbers from $16-30$ in the second column, 4 numbers $31-45$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 numbers from $46-60$ in the fourth column and 5 numbers from $61-75$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$31$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$32$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$34$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$35$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$50$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$49$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$48$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$47$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$46$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$71$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$72$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$73$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$74$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$75$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.  A player wins when he marks 5 in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nHow many distinct possibilities are there for the values in the diagonal going from top left to bottom right of a BINGO card, in order?",
        "inference": "To form a diagonal, we must choose one number from each of the 5 columns.\n\nWe can choose any of the 5 numbers in the first column.  Once we've chosen one from the first column, we have 5 options for the second column, then 4 options for the third column (since we must skip the wild square), then 5 options for the fourth, and then 5 options for the fifth column.\n\nSo the number of diagonals is $5\\times 5\\times 4\\times 5\\times 5 = \\boxed{2500}$. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The middle square is WILD, so we do not need to consider it in our count.\n\nThere are 15 choices for the first number.  Since the second number cannot be equal to the first number, there are also 15 choices for the second number.  Likewise, there are 15 choices for the third and fourth numbers.  Therefore there are  \\[15^4=\\boxed{50,\\!625}\\]total choices for this diagonal."

        "inference": "The error in the solution lies in the assumption that you can choose any number from each column without restrictions. This is not true, as you can only choose numbers that form a diagonal.\n\n**Here's the corrected solution:**\n\nA diagonal is formed by choosing one number from each row such that no two numbers are in the same column. There are 5 choices for the first number, 4 choices for the second number, 3 choices for the third number, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the number of diagonals is $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5! = \\boxed{120}$. \n",
