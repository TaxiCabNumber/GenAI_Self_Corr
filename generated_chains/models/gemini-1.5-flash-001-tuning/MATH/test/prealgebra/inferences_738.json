At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 42 people in pilates class.  Today, 36 of them brought yoga mats, 26 of them brought eco-friendly water bottles, and 20 of them remembered to bring both yoga mats and water bottles.
