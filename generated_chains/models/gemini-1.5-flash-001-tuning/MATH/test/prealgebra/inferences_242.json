        "inference": "Let the numerator of the fraction be $x$ and the denominator be $y$. We know that $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{8}$ and $x + y = 91$. From the first equation, we have $8x = 5y$.  Substituting $y = \\frac{8}{5}x$ into the second equation, we get $x + \\frac{8}{5}x = 91$. This simplifies to $\\frac{13}{5}x = 91$, so $x = 35$.  Then $y = 91 - 35 = 56$.
