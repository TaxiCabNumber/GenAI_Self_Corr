At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe angle measures of the three angles of a triangle are in the ratio $1:3:6$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the largest angle?",
        "inference": "Let the measures of the three angles be $x$, $3x$, and $6x$.  Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, we have $x + 3x + 6x = 180^\\circ$.  Solving for $x$, we find $x = 18^\\circ$.  The largest angle measures $6x = 6(18^\\circ) = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{108^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Because the angle measures are in the ratio $1:3:6$, the angle measures are $x$, $3x$, and $6x$ for some value of $x$.  Because the angles of a triangle add to $180^\\circ$, we have $x+3x+6x = 180^\\circ$, so $10x = 180^\\circ$ and $x =18^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $6x = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$."
