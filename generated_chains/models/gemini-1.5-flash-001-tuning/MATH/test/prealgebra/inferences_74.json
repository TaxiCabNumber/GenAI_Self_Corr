At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain number is multiplied by five, the result is the  same as twenty-one plus twice the original number.  What is the value of the original number?",
