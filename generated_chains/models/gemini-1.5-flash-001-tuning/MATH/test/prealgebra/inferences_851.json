At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn triangle $ABC$, the measure of angle $A$ is $x$ degrees, the measure of angle $B$ is $2x$ degrees and the measure of angle $C$ is $5x$ degrees. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "The angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, so we have the equation $x + 2x + 5x = 180$. Combining like terms, we get $8x = 180$. Dividing both sides by 8, we get $x = 22.5$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22.5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we have the equation $x+2x+5x=180$, so $x=\\boxed{22.5}$."
