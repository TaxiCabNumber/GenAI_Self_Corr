At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have twenty balls numbered 1 through 20 in a bin.  In how many ways can I select 2 balls, if the order in which I draw them doesn't matter?",

        "ground_truth": "If the order the balls are selected matters, there are 20 choices for the first selection and 19 choices for the second selection.  However, $20\\cdot 19$ counts each pair of balls twice, once for each possible order in which they can be selected.  So, we must divide by $2$, , to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\boxed{190}$."
