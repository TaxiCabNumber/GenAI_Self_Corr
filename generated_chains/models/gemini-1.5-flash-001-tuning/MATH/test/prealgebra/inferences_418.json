        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number. \n\nWe are given that ten more than five times a number equals five more than ten times the number. \n\nThis can be written as the equation: $5x + 10 = 10x + 5$.\n\nSubtracting $5x$ from both sides, we get: $10 = 5x + 5$.\n\nSubtracting $5$ from both sides, we get: $5 = 5x$.\n\nDividing both sides by $5$, we get: $x = 1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If the number is $x$, then we have  $5x+10=10x+5$.  Subtracting 5 and $5x$ from both sides gives $5=5x$, so $x=\\boxed{1}$."
