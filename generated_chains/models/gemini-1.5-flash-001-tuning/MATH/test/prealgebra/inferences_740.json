At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 450 juniors at East HS drink a total of 1500 cartons of milk per 5-day week. If the average senior drinks milk at the same rate as the average junior, what is the average number of total cartons of milk the 600 seniors drink each school day?",
        "inference": "The juniors drink an average of $\\frac{1500}{5}=300$ cartons of milk per day.\nSince there are 450 juniors, each junior drinks an average of $\\frac{300}{450}=\\frac{2}{3}$ cartons of milk per day.\nThus, the 600 seniors drink a total of $600\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}=400$ cartons of milk per day. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{400}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If 450 juniors drink 1500 cartons in 5 days, they drink 300 cartons per day. 600 seniors drink $600/450=4/3$ as much milk as 450 juniors, so they drink $300 \\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{400}$ cartons of milk a day."

        "inference": "The error is assuming that the seniors drink the same amount of milk per day as the juniors.  We only know the total milk consumed by juniors, not the amount each junior drinks.\n\n**Here's the correct solution:**\n\nWe are given that the juniors drink 1500 cartons of milk per day.  Since there are 450 juniors, each junior drinks an average of 1500/450 = 3.33 cartons of milk per day.  We are also given that there are 600 seniors. Since the seniors drink the same amount of milk per day as the juniors, the seniors drink a total of 600 * 3.33 = **2000 cartons of milk per day**.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2000}$.
