At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",

Since $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in $42!$.\n\nThere are more factors of 2 than 5 in 42!, so we only need to count the factors of 5.  The multiples of 5 from 1 to 42 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.  This gives us 8 factors of 5.  However, 25 and 40 each have two factors of 5.

        "ground_truth": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nEvery time a number is a multiple of $5$, it adds a factor of $5$ to the prime factorization. There are $8$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $42$. Now look at $25$. It actually has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them, so now we need to count one more. This gives a total of $8+1=9$ times the factor $5$ appears, so $42!$ has $\\boxed{9}$ zeroes at the end."
