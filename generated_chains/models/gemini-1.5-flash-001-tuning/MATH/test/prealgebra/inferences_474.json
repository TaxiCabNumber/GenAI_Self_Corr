At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt is a beautiful day at the beach and ten beach volleyball players have shown up at the volleyball courts. Each two-person volleyball team should consist of a setter and a spiker. Five of the players prefer to be a spiker, four of the players prefer to be a setter, and one player is fine either way.\n\nIn how many ways can a two-person team be assembled such that no player feels out of position?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the five spikers can be matched with any of the four setters to make $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ possible teams.\n\nThe one player who is fine either way can be matched with any of the nine other players to make $9$ possible teams.\n\nTherefore, there are $20 + 9 = \\boxed{29}$ possible teams in which no player feels out of position."
