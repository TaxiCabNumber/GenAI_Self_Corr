At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the negative number.  We are given that $6x = x-20$.  Solving for $x$, we get $5x=-20$, so $x = \\boxed{-4}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $6x=x-20$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5x=-20$. Then, dividing both sides by 5 gives $x= \\boxed{-4}$."
