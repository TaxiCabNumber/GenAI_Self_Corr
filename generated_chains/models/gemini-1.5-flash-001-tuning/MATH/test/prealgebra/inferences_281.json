At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDeanna has $44$ pieces of candy. What is the largest number of kids whom she can give an equal number of candies such that every kid gets at least $3$ pieces?",

        "ground_truth": "For $n$ kids to each get at least $3$ pieces of candy, there must be at least $3n$ pieces of candy, so we must have $3n\\le 44$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $3$, we have $n\\le 14\\frac23$. Since the number of kids must be an integer, the largest possible number of kids is $\\boxed{14}$."
