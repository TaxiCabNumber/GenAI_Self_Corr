At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can I put down two indistinguishable pieces on an ordinary $8\\times 8$ chessboard, if the pieces must either be in the same row or be in the same column?",

        "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$."
