        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA world-record swimmer and a dolphin compete in a 400-meter race. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, and the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second. When the dolphin crosses the finish line, how many meters is the swimmer from the finish line?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe dolphin finishes the race in 400 meters / 8 meters per second = 50 seconds.\nIn 50 seconds, the swimmer covers 50 seconds * 2 meters per second = 100 meters.\nTherefore, when the dolphin crosses the finish line, the swimmer is 400 meters - 100 meters = 300 meters from the finish line. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{300}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The dolphin swims four times faster than the swimmer, so it covers four times the distance in a given time. So when the dolphin has swum 400 meters to get to the finish line, the swimmer has swum $400/4=100$ meters, and is thus $400-100=\\boxed{300}$ meters from the finish line."
