Glow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright and has $33\\frac{1}{3} \\%$ more volume than Fresh. Fresh costs $\\$1.00$ per unit of volume. What is the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow?",

        "inference": "The error is in the last line. The question asks for the percentage of the cost per unit volume of Glow relative to the cost per unit volume of Bright.  We have that the cost per unit volume of Glow is $\\frac{1.2x}{1.33y} = \\frac{1.2}{1.33}\\cdot \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{1.2}{1.33}$, and the cost per unit volume of Bright is $\\frac{1.6x}{y} = 1.6\\cdot\\frac{x}{y} = 1.6$.
