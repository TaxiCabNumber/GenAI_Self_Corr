At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA number is doubled, then decreased by $13.7$.  The result is greater than $125.28$. What is the smallest integer that satisfies this condition?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the number.  We can translate the given information into an inequality:\n\n$$2x - 13.7 > 125.28$$\n\nAdding $13.7$ to both sides, we get:\n\n$$2x > 139$$\n\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get:\n\n$$x > 69.5$$\n\nThe smallest integer greater than $69.5$ is $70$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{70}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the desired integer. Then $2x-13.7>125.28$.  Adding $13.7$ to both sides gives $2x>138.98$, and dividing both sides by $2$ gives $x>69.49$.  The smallest integer that is greater than $69.49$ is $\\boxed{70}$."
