        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different combinations of $\\$5$ bills and $\\$2$ bills can be used to make a total of $\\$17$?  Order does not matter in this problem.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of $\\$5$ bills and $y$ be the number of $\\$2$ bills.  We want to find all solutions to the equation \\[5x + 2y = 17.\\]Since $5x$ is always a multiple of 5, and 17 is not, $y$ must be odd.  Also, $y$ must be less than or equal to 8, since $2\\cdot 9 = 18$ is greater than 17.  We can check the possible values of $y$ one by one:\n\nIf $y=1$, then $5x = 15$, so $x=3$.\n\nIf $y=3$, then $5x = 11$, which has no integer solutions.\n\nIf $y=5$, then $5x = 7$, which has no integer solutions.\n\nIf $y=7$, then $5x = 3$, which has no integer solutions.\n\nThus, the only solution is $x=3$ and $y=1$.  Therefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ combination. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the total $\\$17$ is odd, there must be an odd number of $\\$5$ bills.  One $\\$5$ bill plus six $\\$2$ bills is a solution, as is three $\\$5$ bills plus one $\\$2$ bill.  Five $\\$5$ bills exceeds $\\$17$, so these are the only $\\boxed{2}$ combinations that work."
