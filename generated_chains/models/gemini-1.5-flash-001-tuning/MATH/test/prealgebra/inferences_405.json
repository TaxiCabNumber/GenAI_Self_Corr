At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the square root of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 2 units, what is the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ represent the length of the hypotenuse. We're told that $\\sqrt{c}=2$, so $c=4$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($a^2+b^2=c^2$), so our answer is $c^2=\\boxed{16}$."
