At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded in half to form a rectangle. If the resulting rectangle has a perimeter of 18 inches, what is the area of the original square, in square inches?",
