So again, there are 5 ways to choose the first person, then 4 ways to choose second person.  However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $5 \\times 4$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $(5 \\times 4)/2 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to choose a 2-person committee from 5 people."
