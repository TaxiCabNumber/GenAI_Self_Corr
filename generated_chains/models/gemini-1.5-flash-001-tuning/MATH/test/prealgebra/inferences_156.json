At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular January day, the high temperature in Lincoln, Nebraska, was $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, and the average of the high and the low temperatures was $3\\,^\\circ$. In degrees, what was the low temperature in Lincoln that day?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the low temperature.  Then the high temperature was $x+16$.  The average of the high and low temperatures is $\\frac{x+(x+16)}{2}$.  We are given that this average is 3, so we have the equation  \\[\\frac{x+(x+16)}{2}=3.\\] Simplifying, we get  \\[\\frac{2x+16}{2}=3.\\] Multiplying both sides by 2 gives  \\[2x+16=6.\\] Subtracting 16 from both sides gives  \\[2x=-10.\\] Dividing both sides by 2 gives  \\[x=-5.\\] Final Answer: $\\boxed{-5}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, it follows that the average of the two temperatures, which lies halfway between the high and low temperatures, must be $8$ degrees higher than the low temperature and $8$ degrees lower than the high temperature. Thus, if the average is $3^\\circ,$ then the low temperature is $3^\\circ - 8^\\circ = \\boxed{-5^\\circ}.$"
