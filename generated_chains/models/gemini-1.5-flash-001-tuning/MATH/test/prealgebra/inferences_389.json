At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBill travels the 400 miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles at 50 mph. Sam travels the same distance at 40 mph. How many more hours than Bill did it take Sam to travel the 400 miles?",
