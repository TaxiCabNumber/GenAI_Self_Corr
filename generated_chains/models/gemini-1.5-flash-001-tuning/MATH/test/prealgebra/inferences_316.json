        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSam the Sham is an unfair shoe salesman. He has a pair of shoes that was priced at $\\$60$ last week. To entice customers, he wants to put a \"$25\\%$ off'' tag on the shoes but he still wants the customer to pay $\\$60$ for the shoes. He raises the price of the shoes so that after the $25\\%$ discount the shoes will cost $\\$60$. In dollars, what must the new price of the shoes be before the discount?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the new price of the shoes before the discount.  After the $25\\%$ discount, the price of the shoes is $0.75x$.  We want this price to be equal to $\\$60$.  So, we have the equation: \n $$0.75x=60.$$  Dividing both sides by $0.75$, we find $x=60/0.75=\\boxed{80}$. \n Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\$80}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the new price of the shoes be $x$. We are told that after a $25\\%$ discount, the shoes cost 60 dollars. Thus, $\\frac{3}{4}x = 60$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{80}$."
