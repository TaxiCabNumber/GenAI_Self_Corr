At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 5-inch by 7-inch picture is placed on a rectangular piece of red paper such that a 0.5-inch wide red border is seen along each side of the picture. What is the area of the visible red border, in square inches?",

        "ground_truth": "The piece of red paper must have dimensions of 6 inches by 8 inches in order to have a 0.5 inch border on each side. The area of the paper is 48 square inches, of which $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ square inches are obscured by the picture. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is $48 - 35 = \\boxed{13}$ square inches."
