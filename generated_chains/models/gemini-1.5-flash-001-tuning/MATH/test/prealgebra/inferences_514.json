At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",

The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes."
