At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle so that the six-digit number is divisible by 4? $$3\\:5\\:2\\:9 \\bigcirc 2$$",

        "ground_truth": "Using the divisibility rule for 4, the six-digit number will be divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. Of the two-digit numbers ending in 2, only 12, 32, 52, 72, and 92 are divisible by 4. Thus the greatest digit is $\\boxed{9}$."
