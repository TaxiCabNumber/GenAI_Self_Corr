At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bookcase has 3 shelves with a total of 24 books. The top shelf has 8 mystery books. The middle shelf has 10 math books. The bottom shelf has 6 science books. Two books are now taken off each shelf. What fraction of the books remaining on the three shelves are math books? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "Six books are removed from the shelves, so $24-6=18$ books remain.  Of these, $10-2=8$ are math books.  Therefore, $8/18=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$ of the books remaining are math books."
