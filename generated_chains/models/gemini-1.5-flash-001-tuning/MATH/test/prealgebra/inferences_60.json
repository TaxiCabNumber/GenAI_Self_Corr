I hope it is correct.'\nA railroad trestle spans a gorge 80 feet wide and connects two cliffs at heights of 112 and 172 feet above the bottom of the gorge. A train is crossing this gorge from the higher cliff to the lower. When the front of the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length, how many feet is it above the bottom of the gorge?",
        "inference": "Let $A$ be the point on the higher cliff where the train starts, $B$ be the point on the lower cliff where the train ends, and $C$ be the point on the trestle where the front of the train is when it has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C;\n\nA = (0,172);\nB = (80,112);\nC = (60,144);\n\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C--B);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,C,B,20));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$80$\", (A + B)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$112$\", (B + (80,0))/2, E);\nlabel(\"$172$\", (A + (0,0))/2, W);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (A + C)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (C + B)/2, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince the train has traveled $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length, it has $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the trestle's length left to travel. Let $x$ be the distance from $A$ to $C$ and $y$ be the distance from $C$ to $B$. Then $x + y = 80$ and $x = 3y$. Substituting $3y$ for $x$ in the first equation, we get $3y + y = 80$, so $y = 20$.  Since the train is traveling down a line that connects the two cliffs, we can use similar triangles to find the height of the train above the bottom of the gorge. The ratio of the height of the train to the height of the lower cliff is equal to the ratio of the distance from the higher cliff to the train to the total distance across the gorge: \n\n\\[\\frac{h - 112}{112} = \\frac{x}{80}.\\]Since $x = 3y = 60$, we have  \\[\\frac{h - 112}{112} = \\frac{60}{80}.\\] Solving for $h$, we get $h = \\boxed{144}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the railroad trestle is a straight path connecting the two cliffs, we know that after the train has traveled $3/4$ of the trestle's length, the train has traveled both $3/4$ the horizontal distance between the two cliffs and the $3/4$ of the vertical distance between the cliffs' heights. The difference between the heights of the two cliffs is $172-112=60$ feet. $3/4$ of that difference is $45$ feet. Since the train started from the higher cliff and was moving toward the lower cliff, it has descended $45$ feet from its original altitude of $172$ feet. Therefore, the train is now $172-45=\\boxed{127}$ feet above the bottom of the gorge."
