At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units?",
        "inference": "The circumference of a circle is given by $C=2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius.  We know that the circumference is $12\\pi$ units, so we can solve for the radius:\n\n $$12\\pi=2\\pi r$$\n $$r=\\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi}=6$$\n\nThe area of a square is given by $A=s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Since the side length of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, we have:\n\n $$A=s^2=6^2=36$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "$C=2\\pi r$, so $12\\pi=2\\pi r$. Thus, $r=6$. The area of a square with side length 6 is $6^2=\\boxed{36} \\text{ sq units}$."
