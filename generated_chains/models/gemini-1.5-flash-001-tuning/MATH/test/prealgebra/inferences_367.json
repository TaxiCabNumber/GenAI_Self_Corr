        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo right triangles have equal areas. The first triangle has a height of 5 cm and a corresponding base of 8 cm. The second triangle has a leg of length 20 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the second triangle, in cm?",
        "inference": "Solution: The area of the first triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(8)=20$ square centimeters. The area of the second triangle is also 20 square centimeters, so if the length of one leg is 20 cm, the length of the other leg is $20\\cdot2/20=\\boxed{2}$ cm. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since in a triangle $A = \\frac{1}{2} bh$, we see that the product of the base and height must be the same in both triangles.  So $5\\cdot 8 = \\text{(second triangle's base)}\\cdot20$, meaning that the second triangle's base is $\\boxed{2}$ centimeters."
