At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe rectangle pictured consists of two squares placed side by side. The perimeter of the rectangle is 60 cm.  What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?\n\n[asy]\nsize(60); draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(0,1)--cycle); draw((1,0)--(1,1),linetype(\"6 4\"));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the side length of each square.  The perimeter of the rectangle is $2s + 2(2s) = 6s$.  Since the perimeter is 60 cm, $6s = 60$, so $s = 10$.  The area of the rectangle is $s \\cdot 2s = 10 \\cdot 20 = 200$ square centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The sides of the rectangle consist of a total of 6 side lengths of one of the squares.  Therefore, each side of a square has length $60/6 = 10$ cm.  So, the rectangle is 10 cm by 20 cm, and its area is $(10)(20) = \\boxed{200}$ square centimeters."
