At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo bicycle racers cross the starting line on a circular track at 12:15 PM. One cyclist takes $12$ minutes per lap, while the other completes a lap every $16$ minutes. Assuming their speeds remain constant, what is the next time they cross the starting line together?  Your answer should be in the form $h:m_1m_2,$ like 3:45.",
        "inference": "To find when the cyclists cross the starting line together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their lap times. \n\nThe LCM of 12 and 16 is 48.  This means the cyclist who completes a lap every 12 minutes will complete 4 laps in 48 minutes, while the cyclist who takes 16 minutes per lap will complete 3 laps in 48 minutes.\n\nSince they both start at 12:15 PM, they will cross the starting line together again in 48 minutes, which is at 1:03 PM.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1:03}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We seek the least common multiple of $12$ minutes and $16$ minutes. This gives the amount of time that transpires until the two again cross the starting line together. $12=2^2\\cdot 3$ and $16=2^4$, so taking the highest power of each yields $LCM(12,16)=2^4\\cdot 3=48$ minutes, so that the desired time is $48$ minutes past $\\text{12:15 PM}$, or $\\boxed{\\text{1:03 PM}}$."
