        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain amount of time, a plane traveling at a constant $250$ miles per hour traveled $20,\\!000$ feet.  In this same amount of time, how many feet would a plane traveling at a constant $400$ miles per hour travel?",
        "inference": "First, we need to convert the distance the first plane traveled to miles. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so 20,000 feet is equal to $20000/5280=3.78787878788$ miles.\n\nThen, we can find the time the first plane traveled by dividing the distance it traveled by its speed: $3.78787878788/250 = 0.01515151515$ hours.\n\nSince the second plane travels for the same amount of time, we can find the distance it travels by multiplying its speed by the time: $400 * 0.01515151515 = 6.0606060606$ miles.\n\nFinally, we convert this distance back to feet: $6.0606060606 * 5280 = 32000$ feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the ratio of the speeds of the planes will be equal to the ratio of the distances that each travels.  Since the ratio of the speed of the faster plane to that of the slower one is $\\frac{400}{250}$, the distance that the faster plane travels is $20,\\!000 \\times \\frac{400}{250}=\\boxed{32,\\!000}$ feet.\n\nAnother way to do this problem is to use the formula Distance = Rate $\\times$ Time. We would use this formula to find, using the information of the first plane, the exact amount of time it took to travel $20,\\!000$ feet. Then using this new information we would again apply the formula, this time for the second plane, to find the answer.  This approach, however, is more complicated and requires conversion between units (feet to miles and vice versa)."
