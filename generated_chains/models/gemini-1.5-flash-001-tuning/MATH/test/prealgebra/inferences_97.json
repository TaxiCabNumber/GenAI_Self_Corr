At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The  part-to-part ratio $5:3$ is a total of 8 parts, so each part must be worth $24 \\div 8 = 3$ feet. That means the length is $5 \\times 3 = 15$ feet and the width is  $3 \\times 3 = 9$ feet, so the area must be $15 \\times 9 = \\boxed{135\\text{ square feet}}$."
