At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe shape of the sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is a regular octagon. How many degrees are in the measure of an interior angle of this sign?",

The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = \\boxed{135^\\circ}$."
