At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA birdbath is designed to overflow so that it will be self-cleaning.  Water flows in at the rate of 20 milliliters per minute and drains at the rate of 18 milliliters per minute.  One of these graphs shows the volume of water in the birdbath during the filling time and continuing into the overflow time.

        "inference": "The birdbath is filling at a rate of 2 milliliters per minute (20 ml/min in - 18 ml/min out = 2 ml/min net increase).  So the graph of the volume of water in the birdbath should be a line with a slope of 2.  The only graph that shows this is **graph C**.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{C}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Initially, volume increases with time as shown by graphs $A$, $C$, and $E$.  But once the birdbath is full, the volume remains constant as the birdbath overflows.  Only graph $\\boxed{A}$ shows both features."
