At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSharon bought a mixture of nuts that was made up of pecans, walnuts and cashews in a ratio by weight of $2:3:1$, respectively. If she bought $9$ pounds of nuts, how many pounds of walnuts were in the mixture? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

        "ground_truth": "Since the pecan to walnut to cashew ratio is $2:3:1$, it follows that the walnut ratio to all of the nuts is equal to $\\frac{3}{2+3+1} = \\frac 12$. Thus, there were $\\frac 12\\times 9 = \\boxed{4.5}$ pounds of walnuts in the mixture."
