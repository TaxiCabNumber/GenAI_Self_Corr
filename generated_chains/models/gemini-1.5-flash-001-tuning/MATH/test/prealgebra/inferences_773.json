At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a set of five positive integers whose average (mean) is 5, whose median is 5, and whose only mode is 8. What is the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the set?",

The five integers may be arranged this way: $\\underline{\\ \\ \\ }, \\ \\underline{\\ \\ \\ },  \\  5, \\  8, \\ 8$. Since the mean is 5, the sum of all five integers is 25. The numbers 5, 8, and 8 total 21, leaving 4 for the sum of the first two. They can't both be 2 since 8 is the only mode, so they are 1 and 3. The difference between 8 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$."
