At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $3x + 2(1 + x) = 17$, what is the value of $6x + 5$?",

        "ground_truth": "Expanding and collecting terms on the left hand side of the first equation gives $5x+2=17$. Subtracting 2 from each side gives $5x=15$, then dividing each side by 5 gives $x=3$. Now that we know what $x$ is, we can substitute it into $6x+5$ and get $6(3)+5=18+5=\\boxed{23}$."
