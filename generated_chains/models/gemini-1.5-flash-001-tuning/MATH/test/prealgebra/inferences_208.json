At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBrass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?",

        "ground_truth": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc."
