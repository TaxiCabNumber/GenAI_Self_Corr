At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of a whole number and the next four consecutive whole numbers is $105$. Find the result when the mean of the numbers is subtracted from the median of the numbers.",
        "inference": "Let the first whole number be $x$. Then the five consecutive whole numbers are $x$, $x+1$, $x+2$, $x+3$, and $x+4$. Their sum is $5x+10$. We are given that this sum is $105$, so $5x+10 = 105$. Solving for $x$, we find $x=19$. Thus, the five numbers are 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. The mean of these numbers is $\\frac{19+20+21+22+23}{5} = 21$. The median of these numbers is 21. Subtracting the mean from the median, we get $21-21=0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the given whole number be $x$. The sequence contains five numbers $x,x+1,x+2,x+3,x+4$. Obviously, the mean and the median are both $x+2$, so that their difference is $\\boxed{0}$."
