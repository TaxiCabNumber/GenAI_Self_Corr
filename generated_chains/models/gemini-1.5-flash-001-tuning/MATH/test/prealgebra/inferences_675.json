        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI am going to buy exotic fruits.  Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars.  Starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan.  Rambutan costs $2x$ dollars more than dragonfruit.  How much does it cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit? Your answer will be an expression that depends on $x$.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nRambutan costs $2x + (x-4) = 3x-4$ dollars.\nStarfruit costs $3x-4 - 5 = 3x-9$ dollars.\nThe cost of three dragonfruits is $3(x-4) = 3x - 12$ dollars.\nThe cost of two starfruit is $2(3x-9) = 6x-18$ dollars.\nThe total cost is $3x - 4 + 6x - 18 + 3x - 12 = 12x - 34$ dollars.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12x - 34}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "We know that one dragonfruit is $x-4$ dollars.  This means that one rambutan is $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars.  Then, one starfruit is $(3x-4) -5 = 3x-9$ dollars. We want to find $1 \\cdot (3x-4) + 2 \\cdot (3x-9) + 3 \\cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$. Finally, we combine like terms, yielding $(3x + 6x + 3x) + (-4 + -18 + -12) = (12x) + (-34)$.  We obtain $\\boxed{12x -34}$, or $\\boxed{-34 + 12x}$."
