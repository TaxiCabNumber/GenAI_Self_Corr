At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard six-sided die was rolled 50 times, and the outcomes are shown in the table. What is the average of the 50 outcomes? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nOutcome&$\\#$ of Occurrences\\\\\\hline\n1&14\\\\\\hline\n2&5\\\\\\hline\n3&9\\\\\\hline\n4&7\\\\\\hline\n5&7\\\\\\hline\n6&8\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",
