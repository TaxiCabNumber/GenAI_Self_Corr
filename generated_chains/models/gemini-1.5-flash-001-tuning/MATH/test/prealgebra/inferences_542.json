At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCasey's shop class is making a golf trophy.  He has to paint $300$ dimples on a golf ball.  If it takes him $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, how many minutes will he need to do his job?",

        "ground_truth": "At $2$ seconds per dimple, it takes $300 \\times 2 = 600$ seconds to paint them.  Since there are $60$ seconds in a minute, he will need $600 \\div 60 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes."
