At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA convex pentagon has three right angles. The other two angles are congruent to each other. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of these other angles?",

The five angles of a pentagon sum to 540 degrees, so if a pentagon has three right angles and two other angles each of which measures $x$ degrees, then  \\[\n3\\cdot90+2x=540.\n\\] Solving, we find $x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
