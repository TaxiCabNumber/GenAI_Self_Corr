At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKarla drove her vehicle 12,000 miles last year. How many gallons of gasoline would she have saved last year had she driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon rather than an SUV averaging 15 miles per gallon?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Find the number of gallons Karla used in the SUV: 12,000 miles / 15 miles/gallon = 800 gallons\n2. Find the number of gallons Karla would have used in the hybrid: 12,000 miles / 48 miles/gallon = 250 gallons\n3. Find the difference in gas usage: 800 gallons - 250 gallons = 550 gallons\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{550}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
