Noting that the lowest common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14, we can multiply the panda-cat equality by 2 to learn that 6 pandas = 14 cats and multiply the cat-alpaca equality by 7 to learn that 14 cats = 35 alpacas. Combining these two equalities, we see that 6 pandas = 35 alpacas. Since $70\\div 35 = 2$, we can double the panda-alpaca equation to learn that 12 pandas = 70 alpacas.
