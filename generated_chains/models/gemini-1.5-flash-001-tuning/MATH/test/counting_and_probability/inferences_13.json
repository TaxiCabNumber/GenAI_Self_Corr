At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many distinguishable ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (If the table is rotated, it should be counted as the same seating.)",

Then there are $5!$ ways to place the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in their seats, for a total of $5! \\times 5! = \\boxed{14,\\!400}$ arrangements."
