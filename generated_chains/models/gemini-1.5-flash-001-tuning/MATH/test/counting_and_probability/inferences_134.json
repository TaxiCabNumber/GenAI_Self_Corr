I hope it is correct.'\nLink is coloring a triforce, which consists of four equilateral triangles and is depicted below. He has three colors to use: gold, black, and green. So that it remains recognizable, he doesn't want to color any two triangles the same color if they share a side. How many different ways can he color the triforce? (Two colorings that differ by rotation are considered distinct.) [asy]\nsize(50);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(1,1.732)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1.5,.866)--(.5,.866)--cycle);\n[/asy]",
