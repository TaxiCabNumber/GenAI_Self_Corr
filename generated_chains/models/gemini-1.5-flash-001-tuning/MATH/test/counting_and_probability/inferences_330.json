At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag contains 4 balls. Each ball is a single color, and 3 distinct colors are represented in the bag. What is the probability that the first 2 balls selected without replacement are the same color? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
