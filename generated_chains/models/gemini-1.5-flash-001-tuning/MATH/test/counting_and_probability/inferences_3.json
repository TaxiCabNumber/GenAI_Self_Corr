I hope it is correct.'\nWhen rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is less than $1/6$, the probability of obtaining each of the other faces is $1/6$, and the sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $ \\frac{47}{288} $. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of rolling face $F$ and $q$ be the probability of rolling the face opposite face $F$.  Since the probabilities of rolling each of the other four faces is $\\frac{1}{6}$, we have $p + q + \\frac{4}{6} = 1$.  Simplifying, we get $p + q = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nLet $x$ be the number on face $F$.  The number on the opposite face is $7-x$.  Since the probability of rolling face $F$ is greater than $\\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability of rolling the opposite face is less than $\\frac{1}{6}$, we have $p > \\frac{1}{6}$ and $q < \\frac{1}{6}$.  This means $x$ must be one of the following: 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nLet's consider the possible pairs of opposite faces and their corresponding probabilities of rolling a sum of 7 when two dice are rolled.\n\n* If $x = 2$, then the opposite face is 5.

The same is true for rolling a 6 on one die and a 1 on the other.

Simplifying, we get $q^2 - \\frac{1}{3}q + \\frac{1}{12} = 0$.  This factors as $\\left( q - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) \\left( q - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = 0$, so $q = \\frac{1}{4}$ or $q = \\frac{1}{3}$.  Since $q < \\frac{1}{6}$, we must have $q = \\frac{1}{4}$.

        "inference": "The provided solution is incorrect. Here's why and the correct solution:\n\n* **The issue:**  The problem states the probability of rolling a 7 is 47/288. However, the solution calculates the probability of rolling a 7 as 19/36. This mismatch is the primary error.\n\n**Here's the corrected approach:**\n\n1. **Understanding the setup:** We have a standard six-sided die with two faces (F and its opposite) having probabilities different from 1/6. The remaining four faces have a probability of 1/6 each.\n\n2. **Setting up equations:**\n    *  Let `p` be the probability of rolling face `F` and `q` be the probability of rolling its opposite face. \n    *  We know `p + q + 4/6 = 1`, which simplifies to `p + q = 1/3`.\n\n3. **Finding the probability of rolling a 7:**\n    * The only ways to get a 7 with two dice are (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1). \n    * The probability of (1, 6) or (6, 1) is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36.\n    * The probability of (2, 5) or (5, 2) is `p * q`. \n    * The probability of (3, 4) or (4, 3) is `p * q`.\n    * Therefore, the total probability of rolling a 7 is: 2(1/36) + 2(p * q) = 47/288\n\n4. **Solving for `p * q`:**\n    * Simplify the equation: 1/18 + 2(p * q) = 47/288\n    * Solve for `p * q`: 2(p * q) = 47/288 - 1/18 = 1/12\n    * Therefore, `p * q = 1/24`.\n\n5. **Solving for `p` and `q`:**\n    * We have two equations: `p + q = 1/3` and `p * q = 1/24`\n    * Solving this system of equations (you can use substitution or other methods), we find:\n        * `p = 1/8`\n        * `q = 1/6`\n\n6. **Finding `m` and `n`:**\n    *  Since `p` is the probability of face `F`, and `p = 1/8`, the number on face `F` must be either 2 or 5 (since these are the only faces with a probability less than 1/6). \n    * Let's assume the number on face `F` is 2. Then the number on the opposite face is 5.\n    * Therefore, `m = 2` and `n = 5`\n    * Finally, `m + n = 2 + 5 = 7`.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \\boxed{7} \n",
