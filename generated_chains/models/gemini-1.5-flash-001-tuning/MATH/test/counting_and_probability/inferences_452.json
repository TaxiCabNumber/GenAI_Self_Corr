At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo numbers between $0$ and $1$ on a number line are to be chosen at random. What is the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit on the number line? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
