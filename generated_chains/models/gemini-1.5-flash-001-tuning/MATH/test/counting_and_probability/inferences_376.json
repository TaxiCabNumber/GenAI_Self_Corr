There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \\boxed{50}$ valid integers."
