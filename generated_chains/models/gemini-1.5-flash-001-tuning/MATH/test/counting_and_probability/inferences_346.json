At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe letters of the word `SIXTEEN' are randomly arranged.

If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$."
