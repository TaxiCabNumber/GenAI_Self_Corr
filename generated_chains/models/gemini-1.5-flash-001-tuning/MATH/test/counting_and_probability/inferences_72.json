At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a three-digit number, the hundreds digit is greater than 5, the tens digit is greater than 4 but less than 8, and the units digit is the smallest prime number. How many three-digit numbers satisfy all of these conditions?",
