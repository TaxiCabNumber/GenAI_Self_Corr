        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Trilisa takes pictures, they turn out with probability $\\frac{1}{5}$. She wants to take enough pictures so that the probability of at least one turning out is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$. How few pictures can she take to accomplish this?",
        "inference": "The probability that a picture *doesn't* turn out is $1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.  The probability that none of her pictures turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$, where $n$ is the number of pictures she takes.  We want this probability to be less than $\\frac{1}{4}$, so we want $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n < \\frac{1}{4}$.  We can solve this inequality by taking the logarithm of both sides:\n\\[n \\log \\frac{4}{5} < \\log \\frac{1}{4}.\\]Since $\\log \\frac{4}{5}$ is negative, we can divide both sides by $\\log \\frac{4}{5}$ and reverse the inequality sign:\n\\[n > \\frac{\\log \\frac{1}{4}}{\\log \\frac{4}{5}}.\\]Using a calculator, we find that $\\frac{\\log \\frac{1}{4}}{\\log \\frac{4}{5}} \\approx 3.219$, so $n$ must be at least 4.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n$.  So we want\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^n<\\frac{1}{4}\\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$\n\nWe see that $4^7>5^6$, but $4^8<5^7$.  Thus the smallest allowable value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
