At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBeth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
