At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
