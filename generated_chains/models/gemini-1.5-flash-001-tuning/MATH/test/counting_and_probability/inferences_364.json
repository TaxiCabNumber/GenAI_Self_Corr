At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNick, Janet, Huiju, and Amanda go to the World's Largest Brat Fest. Each of them is equally likely to order a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. What is the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs?",

We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to.
