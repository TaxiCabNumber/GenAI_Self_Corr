        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn the $xy$-plane, the origin is labeled with an $M$. The points $(1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(0,-1)$ are labeled with $A$'s. The points $(2,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(-1, 1)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(-1, -1)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(1, -1)$ are labeled with $T$'s. The points $(3,0)$, $(2,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(0, 3)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(-2, 1)$, $(-3, 0)$, $(-2,-1)$, $(-1,-2)$, $(0, -3)$, $(1, -2)$, and $(2, -1)$ are labeled with $H$'s. If you are only allowed to move up, down, left, and right, starting from the origin, how many distinct paths can be followed to spell the word MATH?",

        "ground_truth": "From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.\n\nFrom the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.\n\nThus, there are $4 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{28}$ distinct paths."
