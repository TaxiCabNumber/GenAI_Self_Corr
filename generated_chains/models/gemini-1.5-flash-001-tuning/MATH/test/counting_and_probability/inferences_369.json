        "inference": "The number of triangles formed by choosing any three points from the $n$ points on the base is $\\binom{n}{3}$. This gives us the equation $\\binom{n}{3} = 120$. Expanding the binomial coefficient, we have $\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = 120$. Simplifying the equation, we get $n(n-1)(n-2) = 720$. By trial and error, we find that $n=\\boxed{9}$ is the solution to this equation. Final Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
