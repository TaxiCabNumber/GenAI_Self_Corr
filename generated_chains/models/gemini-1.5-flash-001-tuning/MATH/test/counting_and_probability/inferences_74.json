        "inference": "To get from $A$ to $B$, we must take 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up.  Any path can be represented by a string of 5 R's and 2 U's (for example, the path in the problem is represented by \"RRURRU\").  The number of such paths is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 of the 7 positions to be U's (the other 5 positions will be R's).  This is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
