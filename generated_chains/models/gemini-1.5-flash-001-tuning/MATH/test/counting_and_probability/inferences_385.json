At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many nine-digit numbers can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with the digits alternating between odd and even?",

Because the digits must alternate between odd and even, this means that there is only one possible way to distribute odds (O) and evens (E): OEOEOEOEO. Now, there are $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 = 120$ ways to arrange the odd numbers, as there are five choices for the first slot, four for the second, and so on. Similarly, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to arrange the even numbers. Our final answer is the product of $120$ and $24$, which is $\\boxed{2880}$."
