At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
