At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBag A contains $3$ white and $2$ red balls. Bag B contains $6$ white and $3$ red balls. One of the two bags will be chosen at random, and then two balls will be drawn from that bag at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color? Express your answer as a common fraction.
