At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are dealt at random from a standard deck (13 clubs, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts, and 13 spades) of 52 cards.  What is the probability that all three cards are $\\heartsuit$s?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nThe probability of drawing a heart on the first draw is $\\dfrac{13}{52}$.  After a heart is drawn, there are only 12 hearts left and 51 cards total, so the probability of drawing another heart on the second draw is $\\dfrac{12}{51}$.  After two hearts are drawn, there are 11 hearts left and 50 cards total, so the probability of drawing a third heart is $\\dfrac{11}{50}$.  Therefore, the probability of drawing three hearts is $\\dfrac{13}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{12}{51}\\cdot\\dfrac{11}{50} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{850}}$.\n",
