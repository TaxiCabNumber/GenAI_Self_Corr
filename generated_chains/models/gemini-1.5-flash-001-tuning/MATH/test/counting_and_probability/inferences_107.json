        "inference": "The error in the solution is assuming that Annie and Xenas can only overlap if Annie arrives before Xenas.  They could also overlap if Xenas arrives before Annie.  \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nWe have two people, Annie and Xenas, arriving at a place independently within a 2-hour time frame.  We need to find the probability that they arrive within 45 minutes of each other.\n\n**Visualizing the Solution:**\n\nLet's consider a square where the x-axis represents Annie's arrival time and the y-axis represents Xenas' arrival time. The square has side length 120 minutes.\n\nWe want to find the area where Annie and Xenas arrive within 45 minutes of each other.  This area will be a diagonal band within the square.\n\n**Calculating the Area:**\n\n1. **The Diagonal Band:** Draw lines parallel to the diagonals of the square, 45 minutes away from each diagonal.  The area between these lines represents the area where Annie and Xenas arrive within 45 minutes of each other.\n\n2. **Area of the Square:** The total area of the square is 120 minutes * 120 minutes = 14400 square minutes.\n\n3. **Area of the Triangles:** The area outside the diagonal band is composed of four right triangles at the corners of the square. Each triangle has a base and height of 75 minutes (120 - 45).  Therefore, the area of one triangle is (1/2) * 75 * 75 = 2812.5 square minutes. The total area of the four triangles is 2812.5 * 4 = 11250 square minutes.\n\n4. **Area of the Diagonal Band:** The area of the diagonal band is the area of the square minus the area of the four triangles: 14400 - 11250 = 3150 square minutes.\n\n**Calculating the Probability:**\n\nThe probability of Annie and Xenas arriving within 45 minutes of each other is the area of the diagonal band divided by the total area of the square: 3150 / 14400 = 0.21875.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{0.21875}$.  \n",
