At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the elements of the $n$th row (i.e. the row with $n+1$ elements) of Pascal's triangle minus the sum of all the elements from previous rows. For example, \\[f(2) = \\underbrace{(1 + 2 + 1)}_{\\text{2nd row}} - \\underbrace{(1 + 1 + 1)}_{\\text{0th and 1st rows}} = 1. \\]What is the minimum value of $f(n)$ for $n \\ge 2015$?",

        "ground_truth": "Suppose $m \\ge 1$. The sum of the elements of the $m$th row is simply \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{i} = \\sum_{i=0}^m \\binom{m}{i}1^i = (1+1)^m=2^m\\] by the binomial theorem. Thus the sum of the elements of the $k$th row, for $k \\le n$, is $2^k$, so the total sum of all the elements of the previous rows is \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \\frac{2^n-1}{2-1} = 2^n-1\\] by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, $f(n)=2^n-(2^n-1)=1$ for all $n \\ge 2015$. (That is, it is a constant!) Thus, the minimum value is clearly $\\boxed{1}$."
