The coach has 4 jerseys in each of 3 colors to mark 3 teams for a soccer tournament. If the coach wants at least one girl and at least one boy on each team, how many ways can he give out the jerseys? (Jerseys of the same color are indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "First, we need to select one girl and one boy for each team. There are 6 choices for the first girl and 6 choices for the first boy, 5 choices for the second girl and 5 choices for the second boy, and so on. This gives us $6\\times6\\times5\\times5\\times4\\times4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2\\times1\\times1=\\frac{12!}{2!2!2!}$ ways to select the girls and boys.\n\nNow, we need to distribute the remaining 4 jerseys on each team. Since the jerseys are indistinguishable, this is a classic balls-and-urns problem. We have 4 balls (jerseys) and 3 urns (teams), so the number of ways to distribute these is $\\binom{4+3-1}{3-1}=\\binom{6}{2}=15$.\n\nSince we have 3 teams, the total number of ways to distribute the jerseys is $\\left(\\frac{12!}{2!2!2!}\\right)\\times15^3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{12!\\times 15^3}{2!2!2!}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "In all, disregarding the gender rule, there are $$\\binom{12}4\\binom84=\\frac{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5}{4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2}=34650$$ways of assigning the teams. We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot15\\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\\cdot3\\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys. Subtracting this from the total, we get $34650-4950=\\boxed{29700}$ ways for the coach to assign the teams."

        "inference": "The solution is incorrect.  Here's why:\n\n* **Incorrect Ordering:** The initial calculation assumes that the order in which we select the girls and boys matters.  However,  the problem doesn't specify that the order matters for forming the teams. \n* **Double Counting:** The balls and urns calculation is correct for distributing the remaining jerseys *after* the girls and boys are assigned to teams. However, this calculation is performed independently for each team. Since the jerseys are indistinguishable, we're overcounting arrangements. \n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\n1. **Choose teams:** There are $\\binom{12}{6}$ ways to choose 6 players for the first team.  The remaining 6 players automatically form the second team. The third team is irrelevant since we're only interested in the ways to distribute jerseys to the first two teams. \n2. **Distribute jerseys:** After the teams are formed, we need to distribute 4 indistinguishable jerseys to each of the two teams. This is a classic \"balls and urns\" problem, with 4 balls and 2 urns, giving us $\\binom{4+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\binom{12}{6} \\times 5^2}$ \n",
