At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?",
