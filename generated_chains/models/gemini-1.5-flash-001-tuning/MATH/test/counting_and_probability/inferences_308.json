        "inference": "You are correct! There's an error in the solution.  You can't have a fraction of a coloring. The mistake is in assuming that each coloring has *exactly* four rotations that give the same coloring. This isn't always true.\n\nHere's how to fix the solution:\n\n* **Case 1: All squares the same color.** There's only 1 way to do this.\n* **Case 2: Two colors, with two squares of each.** There are 5 ways to choose the first color, and then 4 ways to choose the second.  However, we've overcounted since the color arrangement doesn't matter (red-blue is the same as blue-red).  So we divide by 2. This gives us  (5*4)/2 = 10 colorings.\n* **Case 3:  Three colors, with one square of one color and three of another.** There are 5 ways to choose the color that appears once.  Then there are 4 ways to choose the color that appears three times.  This gives us 5*4 = 20 colorings.\n\nAdding up the cases, we have 1 + 10 + 20 = **31** distinct colorings. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{31}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
