At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the total number of four-digit palindromes. (Recall that a palindrome is a nonnegative sequence of digits which reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 1331. Zero cannot be the first digit.)",

There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).
