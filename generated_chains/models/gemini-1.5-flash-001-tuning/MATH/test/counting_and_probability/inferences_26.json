At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe increasing list of five different integers $\\{3,4,5,8,9\\}$ has a sum of 29.  How many increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers have a sum of 33?",

        "ground_truth": "After some trial and error, we obtain the two lists $\\{4,5,7,8,9\\}$ and $\\{3,6,7,8,9\\}$.\n\nWhy are these the only two?\n\nIf the largest number of the five integers was 8, then the largest that the sum could be would be $8+7+6+5+4=30$, which is too small.  This tells us that we must include one 9 in the list.  (We cannot include any number larger than 9, since each number must be a single-digit number.)\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remaining four numbers is $33-9=24$.\n\nIf the largest of the four remaining numbers is 7, then their largest possible sum would be $7+6+5+4=22$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 8 in the list.\n\nThus, the sum of the remaining three numbers is $24-8=16$.\n\nIf the largest of the three remaining numbers is 6, then their largest possible sum would be $6+5+4=15$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 7 in the list.\n\nThus, the sum of the remaining two numbers is $16-7=9$.\n\nThis tells us that we need two different positive integers, each less than 7, that add to 9.  These must be 3 and 6 or 4 and 5.\n\nThis gives us the two lists above, and shows that they are the only two such lists.  The answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
