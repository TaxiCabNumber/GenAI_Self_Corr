At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.
