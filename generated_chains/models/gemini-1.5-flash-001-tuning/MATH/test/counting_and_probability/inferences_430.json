Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product.
