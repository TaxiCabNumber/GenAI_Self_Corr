At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a fair six-sided die is tossed on a table top, the bottom face cannot be seen.  What is the probability that the product of the  numbers on the five faces that can be seen is divisible by 6?",

        "ground_truth": "If 6 is one of the visible faces, the product will be divisible by 6.  If 6 is not visible, the product of the visible faces will be $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$, which is also divisible by 6.  Because the product is always divisible by 6, the probability is $\\boxed{1}$."
