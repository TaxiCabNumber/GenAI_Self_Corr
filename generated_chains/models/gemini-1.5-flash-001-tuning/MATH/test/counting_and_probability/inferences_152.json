I hope it is correct.'\nThe wheel shown is spun twice, so that the numbers indicated by the pointer are randomly determined (with each number on the wheel being equally likely). The two numbers determined in this way are recorded. The first number is divided by 4, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3 marking the columns of the checkerboard shown. The second number is divided by 5, determining one of the remainders 1,2,3,4 marking the rows of the checkerboard. Finally, a checker is placed on the square where this column and row meet. What is the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1cm);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1.7,1)--(-1.7,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1.7,-1)--(-1.7,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,2)--(0,-2));\nlabel(\"1\",(0.8,0.5),NW);\nlabel(\"2\",(0.8,-0.5),SW);\nlabel(\"6\",(-0.8,0.5),NE);\nlabel(\"9\",(-0.8,-0.5),SE);\nlabel(\"3\",(-0.7,0),W);\nlabel(\"7\",(0.7,0),E);\ndraw((-2.8,0)--(-2.1,0),Arrow);\nlabel(\"Pointer\",(-2.8,0),W);\nfill((3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill((5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((3,-2)--(3,2)--(6,2)--(6,-2)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,-1)--(6,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,0)--(6,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((3,1)--(6,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((4,-2)--(4,2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((5,-2)--(5,2),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(3.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"2\",(4.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(5.5,-2),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(3,-1.5),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(3,-0.5),W);\nlabel(\"3\",(3,0.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(3,1.5),W);\n[/asy]",
