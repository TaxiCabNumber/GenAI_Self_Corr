Given that the first integer chosen is odd, there are 4 odd integers left, and 8 total integers left.  So, the probability that the second integer chosen is also odd is $\\frac{4}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$.

There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose 2 numbers from our set of 9 if we don't care about order.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 odd numbers without regard to order.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$."
