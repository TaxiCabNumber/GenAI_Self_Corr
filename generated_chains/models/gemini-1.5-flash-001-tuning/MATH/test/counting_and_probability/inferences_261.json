At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRegions $A, B, C, J$ and $K$ represent ponds. Logs leave pond $A$ and float down flumes (represented by arrows) to eventually end up in pond $B$ or pond $C$. On leaving a pond, the logs are equally likely to use any available exit flume. Logs can only float in the direction the arrow is pointing. What is the probability that a log in pond $A$ will end up in pond $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"$A$\",(10,22),S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(10,2),S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(10,-7),S);\nlabel(\"$J$\",(2,13),S);\nlabel(\"$K$\",(10,12),S);\npath a=(10,-10)..(20,0)--(0,0)..cycle;\npath b=(10,-7)..(3,0)--(17,0)..cycle;\ndraw(a);\ndraw(b);\nfill((3.1,0.1)--(16.9,0.1)--(16.9,-0.1)--(3.1,-0.1)--cycle,white);\ndraw(Circle((10,0),3));\ndraw(Circle((10,10),3));\ndraw(Circle((10,20),3));\ndraw((10,16.9)--(10,13.1),Arrow);\ndraw((10,6.9)--(10,3.1),Arrow);\ndraw(Circle((2,10),3));\ndraw((2,7)--(2.5,0),Arrow);\ndraw((1.5,7)--(0.2,0),Arrow);\ndraw((10,16.9)--(2,13.2),Arrow);\ndraw((10,16.9)--(19.8,0),Arrow);\ndraw((10,6.9)--(17.2,0),Arrow);\ndraw((3,8)--(10,3.1),Arrow);\n[/asy]",
