At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, the arithmetic mean of the elements is $51.2$. What is the value of $n$?",
        "inference": "The sum of the elements in the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle is $2^n$. The number of elements in the $n$th row is $n+1$. Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the elements in the $n$th row is $\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. We are given that this mean is $51.2$, so $\\frac{2^n}{n+1}=51.2$.  We can rewrite this equation as $2^n = 51.2(n+1)$. We can test values of $n$ to see which value satisfies this equation. For example, if $n=9$, we get $2^9 = 512 = 51.2(10)$. Therefore, $n=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The arithmetic mean equals the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements in the row. In Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, row $n$ has $n+1$ elements and the sum of the elements is $2^n$, which makes the arithmetic mean $\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. Now we look for the value of $n$ that satisfies $51.2=\\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. If $51.2(n+1)=2^n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer, we know that $2^n>51.2\\qquad\\Rightarrow n\\ge 6$. If $n=6$, $2^n=64$, but $51.2(7)$ is much greater than $64$ (we can estimate $51.2(7)$ with $50\\cdot7=350$). With $n=7$ and $n=8$, we also find that $51.2(n+1)$ is greater than $2^n$. When we try $n=9$, we get $51.2(10)=2^{9}=512$, which is true. The value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
