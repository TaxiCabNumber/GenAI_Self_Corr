At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $F$ be the first digit and $L$ be the last digit of the expanded integer form of $2007^3$. What is the value of $F + L$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \nWe only need the first and last digit of $2007^3$. We can compute the last digit as follows:\n$$2007^3\\equiv 7^3 \\equiv 343 \\equiv 3\\pmod{10}.$$ So the last digit is 3.\n \n Now we see that $2007^3$ is a little more than $2000^3=8,000,000,000$, and $2000^3$ is a little more than $2^3\\times 10^9=8,000,000,000$. Thus, the first digit is 8.\n \n So $F+L=8+3=\\boxed{11}$. \n Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite $2007^3$ as the cube of a binomial: \\begin{align*}\n2007^3 &= (2\\cdot 10^3 + 7)^3\\\\\n&= \\binom{3}{0} (2\\cdot 10^3)^3 + \\cdots + \\binom{3}{3} 7^3\n\\end{align*}\n\nOnly the first and last term of the binomial expansion affect the values of $F$ and $L$. The first term is equal to $8\\cdot 10^9$, so $F = 8$. The last term is equal to 343, so $L = 3$. Therefore, $F + L = \\boxed{11}$."
