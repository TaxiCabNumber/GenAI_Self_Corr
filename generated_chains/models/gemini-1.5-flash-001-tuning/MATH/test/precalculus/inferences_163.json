        "inference": "The error in the solution lies in the assumption that the solution for $w$ in the third quadrant is the correct one.  Since we are looking for a value of $\\theta$ between $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$, the corresponding angle for $z^3$ (which is $3\\theta$) must be between $270^\\circ$ and $540^\\circ$.

The solution $w = \\frac{-1 - i \\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\operatorname{cis} 240^\\circ$ leads to $z = \\operatorname{cis} 80^\\circ$, which is valid since $80^\\circ$ is between $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$.  \n\nHowever, the solution $w = \\frac{-1 + i \\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\operatorname{cis} 120^\\circ$ leads to $z = \\operatorname{cis} 40^\\circ$, which is not valid since $40^\\circ$ is not between $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is $\\boxed{80^\\circ}$. \n",
