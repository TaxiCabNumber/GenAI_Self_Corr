        "inference": "The solution is correct.  Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Finding the direction vector of the line:**  The direction vector of the line of intersection is found by taking the cross product of the normal vectors of the two planes. This is because the direction vector must be perpendicular to both normal vectors.\n\n2. **Finding a point on the line:**  Setting $z=0$ in the equations of the planes allows us to solve for $x$ and $y$, giving us a point on the line of intersection.\n\n3. **Finding a normal vector to the desired plane:** The normal vector to the plane containing the line of intersection and the point $(1,1,1)$ is found by taking the cross product of the direction vector of the line and the vector connecting the point on the line to $(1,1,1)$.\n\n4. **Writing the equation of the plane:** Using the normal vector and a point on the plane (the point on the line), we can write the equation of the plane in general form.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** $\\boxed{6x + 5y + 4z - 15 = 0}$ \n",
