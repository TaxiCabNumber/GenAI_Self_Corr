Rearrange the terms of the equation by grouping the $x$ terms together, the $y$ terms together, and moving the constant term to the right side of the equation:\n$(x^2 - 6x) + (2y^2 - 20y) = 12 - 59$\n2. Complete the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms. To complete the square for the $x$ terms, take half of the coefficient of the $x$ term, square it, and add it to both sides of the equation.
