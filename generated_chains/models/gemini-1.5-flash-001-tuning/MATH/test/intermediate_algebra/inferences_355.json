At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA block of cheese in the shape of a rectangular solid measures $10$ cm by $13$ cm by $14$ cm. Ten slices are cut from the cheese. Each slice has a width of $1$ cm and is cut parallel to one face of the cheese. The individual slices are not necessarily parallel to each other. What is the maximum possible volume in cubic cm of the remaining block of cheese after ten slices have been cut off?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1722}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the lengths of the three sides of the rectangular solid after the cutting be $a,b,c$, so that the desired volume is $abc$. Note that each cut reduces one of the dimensions by one, so that after ten cuts, $a+b+c = 10 + 13 + 14 - 10 = 27$.  By the AM-GM inequality, $\\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 9 \\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\Longrightarrow abc \\le \\boxed{729}$. Equality is achieved when $a=b=c=9$, which is possible if we make one slice perpendicular to the $10$ cm edge, four slices perpendicular to the $13$ cm edge, and five slices perpendicular to the $14$ cm edge."
