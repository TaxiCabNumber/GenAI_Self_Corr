        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStacy has $d$ dollars. She enters a mall with $10$ shops and a lottery stall. First she goes to the lottery and her money is doubled, then she goes into the first shop and spends $1024$ dollars. After that she alternates playing the lottery and getting her money doubled (Stacy always wins) then going into a new shop and spending $\\$1024$. When she comes out of the last shop she has no money left. What is the minimum possible value of $d$?",
        "inference": "Let's work backward.\n\n* Since Stacy has no money left after the last shop, she must have had $1024$ dollars before entering it. \n* Before the lottery, she must have had $1024/2 = 512$ dollars.\n* This pattern continues. Before each shop she had half the amount she had after the lottery. \n\nThis means she had $512$ dollars before the second shop, $256$ dollars before the third shop, and so on. This forms a geometric series with the first term being $512$ and the common ratio being $\\frac{1}{2}$. The sum of the first $9$ terms of this series is the amount of money she had before entering the first shop.  \n\nThe sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is $\\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. Therefore, the sum of the first $9$ terms of the series is $\\frac{512(1-(\\frac{1}{2})^9)}{1-(\\frac{1}{2})} = 1023$.\n\nBefore entering the lottery, she had $1023$ dollars. Before entering the first shop, she had $1023 + 1024 = 2047$ dollars.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{2047}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
