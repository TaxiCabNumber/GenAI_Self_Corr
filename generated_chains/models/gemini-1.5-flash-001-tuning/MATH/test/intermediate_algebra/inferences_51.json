        "inference": "The error in the solution is that the track encloses the field, not the other way around. So the width of the field should be the same as the width of the track. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nLet the width of the field (and track) be $w$.  The length of the track is $2l + 2w$ (since the track goes around the field twice). We are given that this length is 400 meters. Therefore, $2l + 2w = 400$, so $l + w = 200$.\n\nThe area of the field is $lw = w(200 - w) = 200w - w^2$. This is a quadratic function with a maximum value at the vertex.  The $w$-coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{-200}{2(-1)} = 100$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the field is $100(200 - 100) = \\boxed{10000}$ square meters. \n",
