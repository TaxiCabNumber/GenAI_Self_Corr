        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There is an error in the solution. The problem statement asks for the number of **ordered triples** $(a,b,c)$, not just the number of ways to choose which two numbers are equal. \n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nSince the equation factors as $(a-b)(a-c)(b-c)=0$, we have three cases:\n\n* **Case 1:** $a=b$.  We have 100 choices for $a$ (and $b$), and 100 choices for $c$.  This gives us $100 \\cdot 100 = 10000$ solutions.\n\n* **Case 2:** $a=c$.  Similar to Case 1, we have 10000 solutions.\n\n* **Case 3:** $b=c$.  Similar to Case 1, we have 10000 solutions.\n\nHowever, we've overcounted the solutions where $a=b=c$. We've counted each of these solutions three times, once for each case. There are 100 solutions where $a=b=c$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is $10000 + 10000 + 10000 - 100 = \\boxed{29900}$. \n",
