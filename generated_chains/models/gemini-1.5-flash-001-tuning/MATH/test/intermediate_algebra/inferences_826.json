        "ground_truth": "Working on the first equation, we have from the difference of squares factorization that $\\log_6 (x-y) + \\log_6 (x+y) = \\log_6 (x^2-y^2) = 2$, so $x^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36$. Using the change of base formula, the second equation becomes $$\\frac{\\log(5x)}{\\log y} = 2 \\Longrightarrow \\log(5x) = 2\\log y = \\log y^2.$$Substituting that $y^2 = x^2 - 36$, it follows that $\\log (x^2 - 36) = \\log y^2 = 2\\log y = \\log 5x$. Since the logarithm is a one-to-one function, it follows that $x^2 - 36 = 5x$, so $x^2 - 5x - 36 = (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0$. Thus, $x = 9, - 4$, but the second does not work. Thus, our answer is $x = \\boxed{9}$."
