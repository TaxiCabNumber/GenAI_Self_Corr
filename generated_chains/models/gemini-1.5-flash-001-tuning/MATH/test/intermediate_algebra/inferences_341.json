        "inference": "You are right, there is an error in the solution!  The problem does not say that $A$ and $C$ coincide with the origin. \n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nLet $A = (a,a^2)$ and $C = (c,c^2)$. Since $OABC$ is a rectangle, $AB$ is horizontal and $BC$ is vertical.  Therefore, $B = (a,c^2)$.\n\nSince $AB$ is horizontal, we have $c^2 = a^2$. Since $BC$ is vertical, we have $a = c$. Combining these equations, we get $a = c$ and $a^2 = c^2$. This means $a$ and $c$ can be any real number.\n\nThe parabola passes through the points $A = (a,a^2)$ and $C = (c,c^2)$ where $a = c$.  This means the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line $x=a=c$.  Since the parabola passes through $(a,a^2)$ and is symmetric about $x=a$, its equation is $\\boxed{y = x^2}$. \n",
