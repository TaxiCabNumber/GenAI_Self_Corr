        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA parabola has vertex of $(4,-5)$ and has two $x$-intercepts, one positive, and one negative.  If this parabola is the graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c,$ which of $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be positive?\n\nEnter the coefficients that must be positive, separated by commas.  For example, if you think $a$ and $c$ must be positive, enter \"$a,$ $c$\", without the quotation marks.",
        "inference": "Solution:  Since the parabola opens upwards, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term, $a$, must be positive.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-b/(2a) = 4,$ so $b$ is negative.  The constant term $c$ is the $y$-intercept of the parabola.  Since the parabola opens upwards and has a negative vertex, the $y$-intercept must be positive.  Therefore, $c$ must be positive.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{a, c}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The $y$-coordinate of the vertex is negative, and there are two $x$-intercepts, so the parabola must be upward facing, which means that $a$ must be positive.    Furthermore, one $x$-intercept is positive and the other is negative, so the $y$-intercept $c$ must be negative.\n\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex is positive, which is also $-\\frac{b}{2a}.$  Since $a$ is positive, $b$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the only coefficient that must be positive is $\\boxed{a}.$"
