        "inference": "You are absolutely correct! There is an error in the solution. The problem is that the statement $5 \\cdot 3i = 15i = 0$ is incorrect.  Complex numbers don't work that way.\n\nHere's a correct approach:\n\nThe mean line of the points $z_k = x_k + 3i$ has a y-intercept of 3 because all the points lie on a horizontal line with a y-coordinate of 3.  The mean line of the points $w_k$ must have a y-intercept of 3 as well, so the difference between the two means is 0.  In other words, $\\sum_{k=1}^5 (z_k - w_k) = 0.$\n\nSince the imaginary part of each $z_k$ is 3,  the imaginary part of $\\sum_{k=1}^5 z_k$ is 15.  Since the imaginary part of each $w_k$ is the same, the imaginary part of $\\sum_{k=1}^5 w_k$ is also 15.  Therefore, the imaginary part of $\\sum_{k=1}^5 (z_k - w_k)$ is 0.\n\nThis means that the sum of the real parts of the $z_k$'s is equal to the sum of the real parts of the $w_k$'s, so\n\\[\\sum_{k = 1}^5 x_k = \\sum_{k = 1}^5 w_k.\\]Since the $w_k$'s can be any complex numbers, the sum of their real parts can be anything.  Therefore, the sum of the real parts of the $z_k$'s can also be anything.  This means there are infinitely many solutions.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{There are infinitely many solutions}}.$",
