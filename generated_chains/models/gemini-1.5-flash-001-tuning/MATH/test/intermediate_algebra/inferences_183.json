        "inference": "You are absolutely right! The solution is incorrect because it assumes the parabola opens upwards. The problem doesn't specify the orientation of the parabola. \n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nLet the parabola be given by the equation $y=kx^2$, where $k$ is a constant. Since the triangle is equilateral and inscribed in the parabola, the vertices of the triangle are at the points $(a,ka^2)$, $(-a,ka^2)$, and $(0,0)$, where $a$ is the length of half the side of the equilateral triangle. \n\nThe distance between $(a,ka^2)$ and $(-a,ka^2)$ is $2a$, and the distance between $(a,ka^2)$ and $(0,0)$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + k^2a^4}$. Since the triangle is equilateral, these distances are equal:\n\n$$2a = \\sqrt{a^2 + k^2a^4}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying gives:\n\n$$4a^2 = a^2 + k^2a^4$$\n$$3a^2 = k^2a^4$$\n\nSince $a$ cannot be zero (otherwise, the triangle would degenerate), we can divide both sides by $a^2$:\n\n$$3 = k^2a^2$$\n\nNow, the distance between $(a,ka^2)$ and $(-a,ka^2)$ is $2a$, which is the side length of the equilateral triangle.
