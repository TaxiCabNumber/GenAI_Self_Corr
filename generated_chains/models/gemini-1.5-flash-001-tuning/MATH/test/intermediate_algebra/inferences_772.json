        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the coordinates of either of the vertices of the hyperbola \\[16x^2+16x-4y^2-20y-85=0.\\](Enter your answer as an ordered pair. Enter the coordinates of one of the vertices, not both.)",
        "inference": "We begin by completing the square in both $x$ and $y$. Factoring out a 16 from the $x$ terms and a $-4$ from the $y$ terms, we obtain \\[16(x^2+x)-4(y^2+5y)=85.\\]Completing the square in $x$, we add $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{4}$ inside the first parentheses.  Completing the square in $y$, we add $\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{25}{4}$ inside the second parentheses.  Since we added $16\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=4$ to the left-hand side by completing the square in $x$, and $-4\\cdot\\frac{25}{4}=-25$ to the left-hand side by completing the square in $y$, we must also add these constants to the right-hand side to maintain equality.  This gives us \\[16\\left(x^2+x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)-4\\left(y^2+5y+\\frac{25}{4}\\right)=85+4-25.\\]Simplifying, we obtain \\[16\\left(x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2-4\\left(y+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2=64.\\]Dividing both sides by 64, we obtain \\[\\frac{\\left(x+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}{4}-\\frac{\\left(y+\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2}{16}=1.\\]Since the $x^2$ term is positive, the hyperbola opens left and right.  The center of the hyperbola is at $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)$, and $a^2=4$.  Therefore, the vertices are located at $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\pm a,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\pm 2,-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{3}{2},-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)}$ and $\\left(-\\frac{5}{2},-\\frac{5}{2}\\right)$.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the standard form for the equation of the hyperbola, we complete the square in both variables: \\[\\begin{aligned} 16(x^2+x) - 4(y^2+5y) - 85  &= 0 \\\\ 16(x^2+x+\\tfrac14)-4(y^2+5y+\\tfrac{25}4) - 85 &= 4 - 25 \\\\ 16(x+\\tfrac12)^2 - 4(y+\\tfrac52)^2 &= 64 \\\\ \\frac{(x+\\tfrac12)^2}{4} - \\frac{(y+\\tfrac52)^2}{16} &= 1. \\end{aligned}\\]Therefore, the center of the hyperbola is the point $\\left(-\\tfrac12, -\\tfrac52\\right).$ The vertices lie to the left and right of the center, and the distance from the center to each vertex is $\\sqrt{4} = 2.$ Thus, the vertices have coordinates \\[\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\pm 2,-\\tfrac52\\right) = \\boxed{\\left(\\tfrac32, -\\tfrac52\\right)} \\text{ and } \\boxed{\\left(-\\tfrac52, -\\tfrac52\\right)}.\\](Either point is a correct answer to this problem.)"
