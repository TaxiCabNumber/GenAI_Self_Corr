At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n$ is an integer, such that $2 \\le n \\le 2010$, for how many values of $n$ is $\\left(1 + \\frac 12 \\right)\\left(1 + \\frac 13 \\right) \\dotsm \\left(1 + \\frac 1n \\right)$ equal to a positive integer?",

For $\\frac{n+1}2$ to be an integer, it follows that $n+1$ must be even and $n$ must be odd. The odd numbers from $2 \\le n \\le 2010$ are given by $3,5, \\ldots, 2009$; there are $\\frac{2009 - 3}{2} + 1 = \\boxed{1004}$ such numbers."
