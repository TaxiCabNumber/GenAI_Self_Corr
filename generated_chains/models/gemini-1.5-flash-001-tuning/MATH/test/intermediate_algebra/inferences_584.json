        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation of a particular ellipse is $9x^2+4y^2-54x+40y+145=0$. Another way to give the equation for ellipses is in the form $$\\dfrac{\\left(x-h\\right)^2}{a^2}+\\dfrac{\\left(y-k\\right)^2}{b^2}=1$$When $9x^2+4y^2-54x+40y+145=0$ is rewritten in this form, what is the value of $h + k + a + b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nFirst, we complete the square. To do so, we rearrange the terms:\n$$9x^2-54x+4y^2+40y=-145$$Next, we factor out the coefficients of the squared terms:\n$$9(x^2-6x)+4(y^2+10y)=-145$$We complete the square inside the parentheses:\n$$9(x^2-6x+9)+4(y^2+10y+25)=-145+81+100$$Simplifying:\n$$9(x-3)^2+4(y+5)^2=36$$Then, we divide both sides by 36:\n$$\\frac{(x-3)^2}{4}+\\frac{(y+5)^2}{9}=1$$So $h=3$, $k=-5$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. Therefore, $h+k+a+b=3-5+2+3=3$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "First, group the terms as follows: $$\\left(9x^2-54x\\right)+\\left(4y^2+40y\\right)=-145$$Factoring out the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ gives $$9\\left(x^2-6x\\right)+4\\left(y^2+10y\\right)=-145$$To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{2}\\right)^2$ after the $6x$ and $\\left(\\dfrac{10}{2}\\right)^2$ after the $10y$.
