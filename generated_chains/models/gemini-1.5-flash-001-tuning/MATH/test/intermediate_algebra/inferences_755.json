At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f$ be a linear function with the properties that $f(1) \\le\nf(2)$, $f(3) \\ge f(4)$, and $f(5) = 5$.  Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) $f(0) < 0$\n\nB) $f(0) = 0$\n\nC) $f(1) < f(0) < f(-1)$\n\nD) $f(0) = 5$\n\nE) $f(0) > 5$",
        "inference": "Since $f$ is linear, its graph is a straight line.  The condition $f(1) \\le f(2)$ means the slope of the line is nonnegative.  The condition $f(3) \\ge f(4)$ means the slope of the line is nonpositive.  Therefore, the slope of the line must be 0.\n\nSince the slope is 0, the function $f$ is constant.  Since $f(5) = 5,$ $f(x) = 5$ for all $x.$  Therefore, $f(0) = 5.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $f$ is a linear function, it has the form $f(x) = mx + b$. Because $f(1) \\le f(2)$, we have $m\n\\ge 0$.  Similarly, $f(3) \\ge f(4)$ implies $m \\le 0$. Hence, $m = 0$, and $f$ is a constant function.  Thus, $f(0) =\nf(5) = 5$, which means $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$ is true."
