        "inference": "The error lies in assuming that the denominator must be 0 at $x=-1$ and $x=2$. The solution provided only considers the points where the expression changes sign. However, the denominator can be 0 at other points as well.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nThe expression changes sign at $x = -1$ and $x = 2$.  This means the denominator must have factors of $x + 1$ and $x - 2,$ so the denominator is of the form $k(x + 1)(x - 2)$ for some constant $k.$\n\nThe numerator changes sign at $x = 1,$ so the numerator must have a factor of $x - 1.$  Thus, the numerator is of the form $m(x - 1)$ for some constant $m.$\n\nThe expression is undefined at $x = -1$ and $x = 2,$ so the denominator must be 0 at these points.  This means $k = 1.$\n\nThe expression is 0 at $x = 1,$ so the numerator must be 0 at this point.  This means $m = 1.$\n\nTherefore, the expression is\n\\[\\frac{x - 1}{(x + 1)(x - 2)}.\\]The sum of the coefficients is $1 - 1 + 1 - 2 = \\boxed{-1}.$ \n",
