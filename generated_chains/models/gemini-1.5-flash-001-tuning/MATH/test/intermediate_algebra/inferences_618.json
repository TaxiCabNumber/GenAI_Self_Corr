Since we can't solve for $a_1$, there must be a problem with the problem.  For example, perhaps the problem should specify that $a_1 = 1$.  In this case, we can solve for $a_1$ using the following steps:\n\nSince $a_{13}$, $a_{14}$, $a_{15}$ is geometric, $a_{14}^2 = a_{13}a_{15}$.  Since $a_{14}$, $a_{15}$, $a_{16}$ is arithmetic, $a_{15} = \\frac{a_{14} + a_{16}}{2}$.  Substituting, we get $a_{14}^2 = a_{13} \\cdot \\frac{a_{14} + a_{16}}{2}$.  Since $a_{13}$, $a_{14}$, $a_{15}$ is geometric, $a_{15} = a_{14} \\cdot \\frac{a_{14}}{a_{13}}$.  Since $a_{14}$, $a_{15}$, $a_{16}$ is arithmetic, $a_{16} = 2a_{15} - a_{14} = 2a_{14} \\cdot \\frac{a_{14}}{a_{13}} - a_{14}$.  Substituting into our previous equation, we get $a_{14}^2 = a_{13} \\cdot \\frac{a_{14} + 2a_{14} \\cdot \\frac{a_{14}}{a_{13}} - a_{14}}{2}$.  Simplifying, we get $a_{14}^2 = a_{14}^2$, which is always true.  Therefore, we can't determine $a_{14}$, and hence we can't determine $a_1$.
