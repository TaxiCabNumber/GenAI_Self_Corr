I hope it is correct.'\n$P(x)$ is a polynomial such that when $P(x)$ is divided by $x-13$ the remainder is $19$, and when $P(x)$ is divided by $x+17$ the remainder is $-11$. What is the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x+17)$?",
        "inference": "By the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, we know that $P(13) = 19$ and $P(-17) = -11$.\n\nLet $R(x)$ be the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-13)(x+17)$. Since the degree of $R(x)$ is less than the degree of $(x-13)(x+17)$, we can write $R(x)$ in the form $ax + b$.\n\nThen, we have the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\nR(13) &= a(13) + b = 19, \\\\\nR(-17) &= a(-17) + b = -11.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSolving this system, we find $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, the remainder is $R(x) = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2}}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since we are dividing by a quadratic, the remainder will have degree less than 2. So the remainder $r(x)=ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. We have,\n$$P(x) = (x-13)(x+17)Q(x) +ax+b$$where $Q(x)$ is the quotient of the division.\n\nThen, using the Remainder Theorem,\n$$\\begin{aligned} P(13) &= 13a+b = 19 \\\\\nP(-17) &= -17a+b = -11 \\end{aligned}$$.\nSolving this system of equations gives us $a=1$ and $b=6$. So the remainder is $\\boxed{x+6}$."
