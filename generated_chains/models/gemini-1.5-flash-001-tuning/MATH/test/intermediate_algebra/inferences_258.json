        "inference": "The provided solution is correct. \n\n**Here's why:**\n\n* **Understanding the Problem:** The problem asks for the sum of the coordinates of the point where a line tangent to a circle intersects the circle. The line is tangent to the circle at the point (a, b), and it passes through the point (2 * 1994, 2 * 1994).\n\n* **Using Tangent Properties:**  The key is recognizing that a tangent line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  This leads to the use of slopes and the relationship between perpendicular lines (product of their slopes is -1).\n\n* **The Solution:** The solution correctly uses the slope formula and the perpendicularity condition to arrive at the equation: (a - 2 * 1994)(a + b) = 0.  Since the point (a, b) lies on the circle, it cannot be the center (2 * 1994, 2 * 1994), so a \u2260 2 * 1994.  Therefore, a + b = 0.\n\n**Final Answer: **  $\\boxed{0}$ \n",
