        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt what value of $y$ is there a horizontal asymptote for the graph of the equation $y=\\frac{4x^3+2x-4}{3x^3-2x^2+5x-1}$?",
        "inference": "Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$4/3$}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are the same in a rational function, the horizontal asymptote is the coefficient of the highest degree in the numerator divided by the coefficient of the highest degree in the denominator. To see this, divide the numerator and denominator by $x^3$ to write the expression as  \\[\n\\frac{4+\\frac{2}{x^2}-\\frac{4}{x^3}}{3-\\frac{2}{x}+\\frac{5}{x^2}-\\frac{1}{x^3}}\n\\]As $x\\to\\infty$ or $x\\to-\\infty$, the terms involving $x$ approach 0, which means that the whole expression approaches 4/3. Therefore, there is only one horizontal asymptote, and it is at $y=\\boxed{\\frac43}$."
