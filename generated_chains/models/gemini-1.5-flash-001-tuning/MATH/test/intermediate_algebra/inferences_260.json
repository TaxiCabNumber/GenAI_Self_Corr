        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $a<c$ and $b<0$. Which of the following must be true?\n\n$ab < ac$\n$a+b<c+b$\n$a-b < c-b$\n$c/a > 1$\n\nEnter your answer as a list of those options that are always true. For instance, if you think only the first and third are true, enter 'A, C'.",
        "inference": "Solution: \n\nSince $b < 0$, multiplying both sides of the inequality $a < c$ by $b$ reverses the inequality sign. Therefore, $ab > ac$.\n\nAdding $b$ to both sides of the inequality $a < c$ preserves the inequality. So, $a + b < c + b$.\n\nSubtracting $b$ from both sides of the inequality $a < c$ preserves the inequality. So, $a - b < c - b$.\n\nSince $a < c$, dividing both sides by $a$ (which is positive) gives $c/a > 1$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{B, C, D}. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we can see that this is not true.\nIf we subtract $b$ from both sides we get $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAdding $b$ to both sides again gives us $a<c$ which we know is true.\nAgain, if we consider a negative $a$ and a positive $c$, we see that $c/a$ is negative and hence not greater than $1$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{B, C}$."
