        "inference": "The solution is incorrect. The problem is asking for the sum of the coefficients of $P(x)$, not the value of $P(x)$ itself. \n\nHere's how to solve it:\n\nLet $P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$.  Substituting into the given equation, we get\n\\[(x^4 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9)(a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0) = x^{23} + 23x^{17} - 18x^{16} - 24x^{15} + 108x^{14}.\\]Expanding the left side, we get a polynomial whose highest degree term is $a_nx^{n+4}$.  Since the right side has highest degree term $x^{23}$, we must have $n + 4 = 23$, so $n = 19$.\n\nNow, the constant term on the left side is $9a_0$.  The constant term on the right side is 0.  Therefore, $9a_0 = 0$, so $a_0 = 0$.\n\nThe coefficient of $x$ on the left side is $-2a_0 + 9a_1$.  The coefficient of $x$ on the right side is 0.  Therefore, $-2a_0 + 9a_1 = 0$, so $a_1 = 0$.\n\nContinuing in this way, we find that all the coefficients of $P(x)$ are 0.  Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of $P(x)$ is $\\boxed{0}$. \n",
