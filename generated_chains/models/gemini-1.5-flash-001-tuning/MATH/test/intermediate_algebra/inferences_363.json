Factoring out $y-4$ from the equation gives \\[(y-4)(y^2+3y+36) = 0.\\]The discriminant of the quadratic $y^2+3y+36$ is $3^2 -4 \\cdot 36 = - 135,$ which is negative, so the only real root of the equation is $y=4.$ Thus, $x = y-12 = \\boxed{-8},$ which can be checked to satisfy the original equation."
