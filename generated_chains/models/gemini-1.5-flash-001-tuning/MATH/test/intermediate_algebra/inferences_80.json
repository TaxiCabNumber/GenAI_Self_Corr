At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is a positive number $S$, and the second term in the series is $1$. What is the smallest possible value of $S?$",

Substituting $ar = 1$ into the equation for $S$, we get $S = \\frac{1}{r(1-r)}$. To minimize $S$, we can minimize $r(1-r)$. By AM-GM, $r(1-r) \\leq \\left(\\frac{r + (1-r)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$, with equality when $r = \\frac{1}{2}$.
