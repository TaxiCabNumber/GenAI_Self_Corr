We can do this by finding the closest multiple of 3 to $100-4n$ that makes $m$ an integer.\n\nThe closest multiple of 3 to 100 is 99, so we try $n=2$: \n$$m = \\frac{100-4(2)}{3}=32$$\n\nThis gives us $m-n = 32-2 = 30$, but we can do better.  Let's try $n=5$: \n$$m = \\frac{100-4(5)}{3}=26\\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThis doesn't work because $m$ is not an integer.
