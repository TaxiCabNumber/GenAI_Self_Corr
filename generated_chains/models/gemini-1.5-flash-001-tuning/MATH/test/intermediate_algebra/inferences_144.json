        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhich type of conic section is described by the equation \\[x^2 - 4y^2 = -8(y-1)^2 + 2x?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\nFirst, we expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[x^2 - 4y^2 = -8y^2 + 16y - 8 + 2x.\\]Then we move all terms to the left side of the equation:\n\\[x^2 - 2x + 4y^2 - 16y + 8 = 0.\\]Next, we complete the square in both $x$ and $y$.  To complete the square in $x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, square it, and add it to both sides of the equation.  Half of $-2$ is $-1$, and $(-1)^2 = 1$, so we add 1 to both sides:\n\\[x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4y^2 - 16y + 8 = 1.\\]To complete the square in $y$, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, square it, and add it to both sides of the equation.  Half of $-16$ is $-8$, and $(-8)^2 = 64$, so we add 64 to both sides:\n\\[x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4y^2 - 16y + 64 + 8 = 1 + 64.\\]Now we can rewrite the left side of the equation as squares:\n\\[(x-1)^2 + 4(y-2)^2 = 65.\\]Dividing both sides by 65, we get\n\\[\\frac{(x-1)^2}{65} + \\frac{(y-2)^2}{65/4} = 1.\\]Since the coefficients of the squared terms have the same sign and are different, the graph is an ellipse.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{E}$. I hope it is correct. \n",
        "ground_truth": "The left-hand side contains $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms with opposite signs. But be careful! The right-hand side, when expanded, contains the term $-8y^2,$ and so when all the terms are moved to the left-hand side, the terms $x^2$ and $4y^2$ will appear. Because the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are of the same signs but unequal, this conic section is an $\\boxed{(\\text{E})}$ ellipse."
