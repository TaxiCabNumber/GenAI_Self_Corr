        "inference": "Setting $x = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get $f(0)f(0) = f(0)$, so $f(0) = 1$.\n\nSetting $x = 1$, we get $f(1)f(2) = f(3)$, and setting $x = 2$, we get $f(2)f(8) = f(18)$.\n\nWe are given that $f(2) + f(3) = 125$.  Substituting $f(3) = f(1)f(2)$ into this equation, we get $f(2) + f(1)f(2) = 125$, or $f(2)(1 + f(1)) = 125$.\n\nSimilarly, substituting $f(18) = f(2)f(8)$ into the equation $f(2)f(8) = f(18)$, we get $f(2)^2f(8) = f(2)f(8)$, so $f(2)^2 = f(2)$.  Since $f(2)$ is a real number, this means $f(2) = 0$ or $f(2) = 1$.\n\nIf $f(2) = 0$, then $f(2)(1 + f(1)) = 0$, which contradicts $f(2)(1 + f(1)) = 125$.  Therefore, $f(2) = 1$.  Then $1 + f(1) = 125$, so $f(1) = 124$.\n\nSetting $x = 5$ in the functional equation, we get $f(5)f(50) = f(265)$.  Since $f(2) = 1$, we can set $x = 1$ in the functional equation to get $f(1)f(2) = f(3)$, so $f(3) = f(1)f(2) = 124$.  Similarly, setting $x = 2$ in the functional equation gives us $f(2)f(8) = f(18)$, so $f(18) = f(2)f(8) = f(8)$.\n\nWe can continue in this way to find that $f(50) = f(8) = f(18) = \\dots$.  This suggests that $f(x)$ might be constant for $x \\ge 2$.  To prove this, we can use induction.\n\nWe have already shown that $f(2) = f(3) = f(8) = f(18) = \\dots$.

Then setting $x = k$ in the functional equation, we get\n\\[f(k) f(2k^2) = f(2k^3 + k).\\]Since $2k^2 \\ge 2k$ and $2k^3 + k \\ge 2k + 1$, we have\n\\[f(2k) f(2k^2) = f(2k^3 + k) = f(2k + 1),\\]so $f(2k^2) = 1$.  Then setting $x = k + 1$ in the functional equation, we get\n\\[f(k + 1) f(2(k + 1)^2) = f(2(k + 1)^3 + (k + 1)).\\]Since $2(k + 1)^2 \\ge 2k + 2$ and $2(k + 1)^3 + (k + 1) \\ge 2k + 3$, we have\n\\[f(2k + 1) f(2(k + 1)^2) = f(2(k + 1)^3 + (k + 1)) = f(2k + 3).\\]Since $f(2k + 1) = f(2k) = 1$, we get $f(2k + 2) = f(2k + 3)$.

Hence $2^ma^2 = 2^ma$, and $a =1$.\n\nBecause $f(0) = 1$, the product of all the roots of $f(x)$ is $\\pm 1$. If $f(\\lambda)=0$, then $f(2\\lambda^3+\\lambda)= 0$.
