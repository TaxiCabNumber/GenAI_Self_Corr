        "inference": "We begin by subtracting 2 from both sides of the inequality to get \\[\\frac{2x-5}{x+3} - 2 \\ge 0.\\]Combining the terms on the left-hand side, we get \\[\\frac{2x-5-2(x+3)}{x+3} \\ge 0,\\]which simplifies to \\[\\frac{-11}{x+3} \\ge 0.\\]Since $-11$ is negative, the left-hand side is nonnegative when $x+3$ is negative.  Therefore, the solution to the inequality is $x+3<0$, or $x<-3$.  In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-3)}$. Final Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-3)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n \\frac{2x-5}{x+3} - 2 &\\ge 0 \\\\\n \\frac{2x-5 - 2(x+3)}{x+3} &\\geq 0 \\\\\n \\frac{-11}{x+3} &\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we must have $x+3 < 0,$ so $x < -3.$ Therefore, the solution set is $\\boxed{ (-\\infty, -3) }.$"
