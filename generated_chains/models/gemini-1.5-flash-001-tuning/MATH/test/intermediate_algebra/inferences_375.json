I hope it is correct.'\nThe asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.",

Solving $2x-3=17-2x,$ we find $x=5,$ so the center is $(5,7).$  The slopes of the asymptotes are $\\pm 2,$ so the hyperbola is vertical.  The distance from the center to each asymptote is $\\frac{7-(2\\cdot 5-3)}{\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}}=2.$  Hence, the distance between the foci is $2\\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}.$ I hope it is correct. \n",
