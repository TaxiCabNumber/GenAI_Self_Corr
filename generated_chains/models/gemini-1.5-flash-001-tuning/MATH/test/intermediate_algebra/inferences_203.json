        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes the function $f(x)$ is linear.  However, we are not given any information about the function's linearity. We need a different approach.\n\nLet's analyze the given functional equation: \n $$f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) + 2xy$$\n\nNotice that if we set $x = y = 0$, we get:\n$$f(0) = f(0) + f(0) + 0$$\nThis simplifies to $f(0) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's try setting $y = 0$:\n$$f(x) = f(x) + f(0) + 0$$\nThis confirms that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nNext, let's set $x = 1$:\n$$f(y + 1) = f(1) + f(y) + 2y$$\n\nWe're given that $f(1) = 4$, so we can substitute that in:\n$$f(y + 1) = 4 + f(y) + 2y$$\n\nLet's try to find a pattern.  We know $f(1) = 4$. Let's calculate $f(2), f(3), f(4)$ using the formula above:\n\n* $f(2) = 4 + f(1) + 2 = 10$\n* $f(3) = 4 + f(2) + 4 = 18$\n* $f(4) = 4 + f(3) + 6 = 28$\n\nLooking at these results, we can see a pattern: $f(n) = n^2 + 3n$.\n\nLet's verify if this pattern holds true. We'll use induction:\n\n* **Base Case:** We've already shown that $f(1) = 4 = 1^2 + 3(1)$ holds.\n* **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume $f(k) = k^2 + 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n* **Inductive Step:** We need to show that $f(k + 1) = (k + 1)^2 + 3(k + 1)$. \n    * Using our functional equation, we have:\n    $$f(k + 1) = f(k) + f(1) + 2k$$\n    * Using the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute:\n    $$f(k + 1) = (k^2 + 3k) + 4 + 2k$$\n    * Simplifying, we get:\n    $$f(k + 1) = k^2 + 5k + 4 = (k + 1)^2 + 3(k + 1)$$\n\nThis completes the inductive step. \n\nTherefore, $f(n) = n^2 + 3n$ for all positive integers $n$. \n\nFinally, we can calculate $f(8)$:\n$$f(8) = 8^2 + 3(8) = 64 + 24 = 88$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88}$.",
