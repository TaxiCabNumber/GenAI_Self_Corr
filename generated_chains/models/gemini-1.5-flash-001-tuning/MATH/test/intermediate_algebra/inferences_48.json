        "inference": "The error is in the assumption that the imaginary part of the discriminant must be 0 for the quadratic to have a real root. This is incorrect.  A quadratic equation has real roots if and only if its discriminant is non-negative. This means both the real and imaginary parts of the discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nHere's the corrected solution:\n\nWe found that the discriminant is $a^2 + 8ai + 904 + 2340i$.  For this to be non-negative, we need both the real and imaginary parts to be non-negative.  As before, the real part $a^2 + 904$ is always positive.\n\nFor the imaginary part, we need $8a + 2340 \\ge 0$.  Solving, we find $a \\ge -292.5$.\n\nTherefore, the solution is $\\boxed{a \\ge -292.5}$. \n",
