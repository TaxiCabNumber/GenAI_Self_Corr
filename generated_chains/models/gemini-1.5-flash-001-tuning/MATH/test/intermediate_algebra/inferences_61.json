        "inference": "Solution: \nSince the root is non-real, its cube is also non-real. This means that the cube root of 343 is also non-real. However, the cube root of 343 is 7, which is real.  This means that the equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ has a real root. Since the equation has a real root and a non-real root, the other root must also be non-real and the complex conjugate of the first non-real root.  Therefore, the roots of the equation are of the form $c$ and $\\overline{c}$.  Since $(c)(\\overline{c}) = |c|^2$, the product of the roots is real.

        "inference": "The solution provided has some errors in the interpretation of the problem and the calculations. Here's a corrected approach:\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe problem states that the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0$ has one root whose cube is 343. This means the non-real root is a complex number, and its cube is a real number (343). \n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **Finding the non-real root:** Since the cube of the non-real root is 343, the root itself must be a complex number whose magnitude is the cube root of 343, which is 7.  The root must also lie on the complex plane such that its cube results in a real number. This means the root must be of the form  7 * cis(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is a multiple of 120\u00b0 (to ensure the cube lands on the real axis). The possible roots are:\n    * 7 * cis(0\u00b0) = 7 (real)\n    * 7 * cis(120\u00b0) = -7/2 + (7\u221a3)/2 * i\n    * 7 * cis(240\u00b0) = -7/2 - (7\u221a3)/2 * i\n\nSince the problem states there is only one non-real root, we can discard the real root (7) and choose either of the remaining complex roots. Let's choose: \n   * **d = -7/2 + (7\u221a3)/2 * i**\n\n* **Finding the real root:** Since the sum of the roots of the quadratic is -a, the real root 'c' can be found as:\n   * c = -a - d = -a + 7/2 - (7\u221a3)/2 * i \n\n* **Using Vieta's formulas:**\n   * **Sum of roots (c + d) = -a:**  Substituting the values of c and d:\n      * -a =  -a + 7/2 - (7\u221a3)/2 * i  - 7/2 + (7\u221a3)/2 * i\n      * This means a must be 0.\n\n   * **Product of roots (c * d) = b:** \n      * b = (-a + 7/2 - (7\u221a3)/2 * i) * (-7/2 + (7\u221a3)/2 * i) \n      * Simplifying, we get: b = -49/4\n\n**Therefore, the answer is (a, b) = (0, -49/4)** \n",
