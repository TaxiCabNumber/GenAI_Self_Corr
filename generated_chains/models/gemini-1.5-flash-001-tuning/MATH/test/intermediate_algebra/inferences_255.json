        "inference": "The error is that the solution finds the minimum value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$, not the maximum.\n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nSince $a,b,c,d$ are positive real numbers, we know that $a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2$ are all non-negative.  Therefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is maximized when one of the variables is as large as possible and the others are 0.  Since $a + b + c + d = 1$, the maximum value of $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
