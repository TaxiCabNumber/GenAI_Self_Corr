At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than $2$.

        "inference": "By the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)$ is $f(1) = 2$, and the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-2)$ is $f(2) = 3$.\n\nSince $(x-1)(x-2)$ is a quadratic, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)(x-2)$ must be a linear polynomial.  Let this remainder be $ax + b$.  Then\n\\[f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2) q(x) + ax + b\\]for some polynomial $q(x)$.  Setting $x = 1,$ we get $2 = a + b,$ and setting $x = 2,$ we get $3 = 2a + b.$  Solving, we find $a = 1$ and $b = 1,$ so the remainder is $x + 1.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x + 1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since $(x-1)(x-2)$ has degree $2$, we know the remainder has degree at most $1$, and thus is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Let $q(x)$ be the quotient. Then we have,\n$$f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)q(x)+ax+b.$$Substituting $x=1$ and $x=2$ gives us the equations:\n$$\\begin{aligned} f(1) &= 2 = a +b \\\\\nf(2) &= 3 = 2a+b \\end{aligned}$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $a=1$ and consequently, $b=1$. Hence the remainder is $\\boxed{x+1}$."
