        "inference": "You are absolutely right! There's a missing piece of information in the solution.  To apply the Integer Root Theorem, we need the polynomial itself. \n\n**Here's how the solution should look with a polynomial:**\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say the polynomial is: $x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x - 4$\n\n**Solution:**\n\nBy the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root of this polynomial must divide the constant term, which is -4.  The divisors of -4 are $\\boxed{-4,-2,-1,1,2,4}$. \n\n**Final Answer:**  $\\boxed{-4,-2,-1,1,2,4}$.  I hope it is correct.\n",
