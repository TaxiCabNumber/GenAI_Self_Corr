        "inference": "The solution is incorrect because it assumes that the two equations have the same roots. This is not necessarily the case.  The problem only states that the equations have a common root.  Here's a corrected approach:\n\nLet the common root be $a$. Then, we can write the equations as:\n\n*  $x^2 + 5x + q = (x-a)(x-b)$ \n*  $x^2 + 7x + r = (x-a)(x-c)$\n\nExpanding these, we get:\n\n*  $x^2 + 5x + q = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab$\n*  $x^2 + 7x + r = x^2 - (a+c)x + ac$\n\nComparing coefficients, we have:\n\n*  $a+b = -5$\n*  $ab = q$\n*  $a+c = -7$\n*  $ac = r$\n\nSubtracting the first and third equations, we get $b-c = 2$.  Dividing the second and fourth equations, we get $b/c = q/r$.  Therefore, \n\n$$\\frac{b}{c} - 1 = \\frac{q}{r} - 1 = \\frac{q-r}{r}$$\n\nSince $b-c = 2$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{c} = \\frac{q-r}{r}$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get $c = \\frac{2r}{q-r}$. Since $b = c + 2$, we have $b = \\frac{2q}{q-r}$.  \n\nTherefore, the other roots are $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{2q}{q-r}, \\frac{2r}{q-r}\\right)}$. \n",
