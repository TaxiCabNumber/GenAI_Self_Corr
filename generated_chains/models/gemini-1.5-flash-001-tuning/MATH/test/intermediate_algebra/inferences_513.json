At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the complex number $z$ satisfying the equation $3z+4i\\bar{z}=1-8i$.  Note that $\\bar{z}$ denotes the conjugate of $z$.",
        "inference": "Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Then $\\bar{z} = a - bi$, so\n\\[3(a + bi) + 4i(a - bi) = 1 - 8i.\\]This simplifies to $(3a + 4b) + (3b + 4a)i = 1 - 8i$.  Equating real and imaginary parts, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n3a + 4b &= 1, \\\\\n3b + 4a &= -8.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = -1$ and $b = 1$, so $z = \\boxed{-1 + i}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1 + i}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $4i\\bar{z}=4b+4ia$.  We now find that \\[ 3z+4i\\bar{z} = (3a+4b) + (4a+3b)i. \\]So if $3z+4i\\bar{z}=1-8i$ then we must have $3a+4b=1$ and $4a+3b=-8$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=-5$ and $b=4$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{-5+4i}$."
