I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x) = x^{10}+5x^9-8x^8+7x^7-x^6-12x^5+4x^4-8x^3+12x^2-5x-5$.\n\nWithout using long division (which would be horribly nasty!), find the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$.",
        "inference": "We can use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, which states that the remainder when a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $x-a$ is $p(a)$.\n\nFirst, we factor $x^2-1 = (x-1)(x+1)$. Therefore, we need to find the remainders when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-1$ and $x+1$.\n\nBy the Polynomial Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x-1$ is $f(1)$.  We compute: \\begin{align*}\nf(1) &= 1^{10}+5(1)^9-8(1)^8+7(1)^7-(1)^6-12(1)^5+4(1)^4-8(1)^3+12(1)^2-5(1)-5 \\\\\n&= 1 + 5 - 8 + 7 - 1 - 12 + 4 - 8 + 12 - 5 - 5 \\\\\n&= -2.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimilarly, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x+1$ is $f(-1)$: \\begin{align*}\nf(-1) &= (-1)^{10}+5(-1)^9-8(-1)^8+7(-1)^7-(-1)^6-12(-1)^5+4(-1)^4-8(-1)^3+12(-1)^2-5(-1)-5 \\\\\n&= 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5 \\\\\n&= 24.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we know that $f(x)$ can be written in the form\n\\[f(x) = (x^2 - 1) q(x) + ax + b\\]for some polynomial $q(x)$ and constants $a$ and $b$.  Substituting $x = 1,$ we get $-2 = a + b.$  Substituting $x = -1,$ we get $24 = -a + b.$  Solving, we find $a = -13$ and $b = 11.$  Therefore, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2 - 1$ is $\\boxed{-13x + 11}$.",
        "ground_truth": "We have\n$$f(x) = q(x)(x^2-1) + r(x),$$where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder. Since $x^2-1$ is quadratic, the remainder is at most linear; let us write $r(x) = ax+b$.\n\nObserve that $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are both zeroes of $x^2-1$. Thus $f(1)=r(1)$ and $f(-1)=r(-1)$.\n\nWe can use the given formula for $f(x)$ to compute $f(1)=-10$ and $f(-1)=16$. Thus we have the system of equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\n-10 = a\\cdot (1) + b,\\\\\n\\phantom{-}16 = a\\cdot (-1) + b.\n\\end{cases}$$Adding these equations yields $6=2b$ and hence $b=3$. Substituting into either equation then yields $a=-13$.\n\nTherefore, $r(x) = ax+b = \\boxed{-13x+3}$."

        "ground_truth": "We have\n$$f(x) = q(x)(x^2-1) + r(x),$$where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder. Since $x^2-1$ is quadratic, the remainder is at most linear; let us write $r(x) = ax+b$.\n\nObserve that $x=-1$ and $x=1$ are both zeroes of $x^2-1$. Thus $f(1)=r(1)$ and $f(-1)=r(-1)$.\n\nWe can use the given formula for $f(x)$ to compute $f(1)=-10$ and $f(-1)=16$. Thus we have the system of equations\n$$\\begin{cases}\n-10 = a\\cdot (1) + b,\\\\\n\\phantom{-}16 = a\\cdot (-1) + b.\n\\end{cases}$$Adding these equations yields $6=2b$ and hence $b=3$. Substituting into either equation then yields $a=-13$.\n\nTherefore, $r(x) = ax+b = \\boxed{-13x+3}$."
