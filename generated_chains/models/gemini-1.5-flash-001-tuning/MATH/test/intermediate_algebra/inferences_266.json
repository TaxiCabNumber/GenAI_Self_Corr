        "inference": "The error in the solution is assuming that $Q(x)$ must have three distinct roots.  Since $Q(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, it must have at least one root.  However, it could have fewer than three roots if the roots are repeated.  \n\nHere's a corrected solution:\n\nSince $Q(17) = Q(24) = -10$,  $x - 17$ is a factor of $Q(x)$.  Let $Q(x) = (x - 17)R(x)$, where $R(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients.  \n\nThen\n\\[R(17) = \\frac{Q(17)}{17 - 17} = \\frac{-10}{0}\\]is undefined.  This means $x - 17$ must be a factor of $R(x)$ as well.  Therefore, $Q(x) = (x - 17)^2 S(x)$ for some polynomial $S(x)$ with integer coefficients.\n\nSince $Q(n) = 0$ for some integer $n$, $x - n$ must be a factor of $Q(x)$.  Since $n \\neq 17$, $x - n$ must be a factor of $S(x)$.\n\nThus, $Q(x) = (x - 17)^2 (x - n) S'(x)$ for some polynomial $S'(x)$ with integer coefficients.  However, this leads to a contradiction, since $Q(24) = -10$ but $(24 - 17)^2 (24 - n)$ is a multiple of $7$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{\\text{no solutions}}$. \n",
