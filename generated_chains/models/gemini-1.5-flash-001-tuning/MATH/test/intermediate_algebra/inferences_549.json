        "inference": "First, we complete the square. Rearranging the terms, we have \\[-6(x^2 - 4x) + 5(y^2 + 4y) = 64.\\]Completing the square in $x$, we add $-6 \\cdot (-2)^2 = -24$ to both sides, and completing the square in $y$, we add $5 \\cdot 2^2 = 20$ to both sides. This gives us \\[-6(x^2 - 4x + 4) + 5(y^2 + 4y + 4) = 64 - 24 + 20.\\]Simplifying, we have \\[-6(x-2)^2 + 5(y+2)^2 = 60.\\]Dividing both sides by 60, we get \\[\\frac{-(x-2)^2}{10} + \\frac{(y+2)^2}{12} = 1.\\]Since the $y^2$ term is positive, the hyperbola opens up and down. The distance between the center and each focus is given by \\[\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{10 + 12} = \\sqrt{22}.\\]The distance between the foci is twice this distance, which is $2\\sqrt{22}$.  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{22}}$.
