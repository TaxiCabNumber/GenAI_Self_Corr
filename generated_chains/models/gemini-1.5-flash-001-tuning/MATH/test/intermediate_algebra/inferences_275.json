        "inference": "Solution: First, we divide both sides of the equation by 99 to get \\[\\frac{x^2}{11} + \\frac{y^2}{891} = 1.\\]Since the denominator of the $y^2$ term is larger than the denominator of the $x^2$ term, the major axis is vertical.  The distance between the foci is $2c$, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$.  We have $a^2 = 891$ and $b^2 = 11$, so $c^2 = 891 - 11 = 880$.  Therefore, $c = \\sqrt{880} = 4 \\sqrt{55}$, and the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{8 \\sqrt{55}}$.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing by $99,$ we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{11} + \\frac{y^2}{9^2 \\cdot 11} = 1.\\]Thus, the length of the major and minor axes are $2\\sqrt{9^2 \\cdot 11} = 18\\sqrt{11}$ and $2\\sqrt{11},$ respectively. Then the distance between the foci of the ellipse is \\[\\sqrt{(18\\sqrt{11})^2 - (2\\sqrt{11})^2} = 2\\sqrt{11} \\cdot \\sqrt{9^2-1} = \\boxed{8\\sqrt{55}}.\\]"
