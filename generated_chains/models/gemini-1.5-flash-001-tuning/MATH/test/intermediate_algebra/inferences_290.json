        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it assumes $c \\neq 0$.  If $c = 0$, then the problem statement becomes:\n\n\"Since $x^2 + bx$ divides $ax^3 + bx$, there exists a polynomial of the form $dx + e$ such that\n\\[(x^2 + bx)(dx + e) = ax^3 + bx.\\]\"\n\nThis can be solved similarly, but we don't need to worry about the term $ce = -c$.  We get the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nd &= a, \\\\\nbd + e &= 0, \\\\\nbe + cd &= b.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom $bd + e = 0$, we get $e = -bd$.  Substituting into $be + cd = b$, we get $-b^2 d + ad = b$.  Since $d = a$, we get $-b^2 a + a^2 = b$, or $a^2 - ab^2 - b = 0$.\n\nFactoring, we get $(a - b)(a + b^2) = 0$.  Since $a$ and $b$ are coefficients of a polynomial, they are real numbers, so $a = b$ or $a = -b^2$.\n\nIf $a = b$, then $ab = b^2 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nIf $a = -b^2$, then $ab = -b^3$.  Since $x^2 + bx$ divides $ax^3 + bx$, $x$ must be a factor of $ax^3 + bx$.  This means $a = 0$, which is not possible if $a = -b^2$.  Therefore, $ab = \\boxed{1}$.",
