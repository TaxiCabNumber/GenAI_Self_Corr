        "inference": "The error is in the calculation of $b$. The problem states that the **distance between the vertices** is 24, not the length of the major axis. This means $2a = 24$, but since the hyperbola is vertical, $2a$ represents the distance between the vertices, not the length of the major axis.\n\nHere is the corrected solution:\n\nSince the distance between the foci is 26, we have $2c = 26$ and $c = 13$. The distance between the vertices is 24, so $2a = 24$ and $a = 12$.  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 13^2 - 12^2 = 25$. The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint of $\\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(-3,2)$, so $(h,k) = (-3,2)$.  Therefore, $h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = \\boxed{16}$. \n",
