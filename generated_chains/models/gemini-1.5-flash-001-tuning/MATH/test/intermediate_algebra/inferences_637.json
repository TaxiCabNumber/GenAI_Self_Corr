        "inference": "The error in the solution is assuming that $y=8$ is a solution to the equation.  We need to solve for $y$ first.\n\nHere's the correct solution:\n\nFrom the equation $y^2(1+y)=x$, we can rearrange to get a cubic equation:\n$$y^3 + y^2 - x = 0.$$\n\nWe are given that $y=8$ is a solution to this equation.  Therefore, we can factor out $(y-8)$ from the cubic:\n\n$$(y-8)(y^2 + 9y + 72) = 0.$$\n\nThe quadratic factor has no real roots, so the only real solution is $y=8$.  Substituting back into the equation $y^2(1+y) = x$, we get:\n\n$$64(1+8) = x.$$\n\nTherefore, $x = \\boxed{576}$. \n",
