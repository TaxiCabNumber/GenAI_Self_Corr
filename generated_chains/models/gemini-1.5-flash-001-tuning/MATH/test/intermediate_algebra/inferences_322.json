        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $P(x)$ has rational coefficients, if $\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}}$ is a root, then so is its conjugate, $\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{6}}$.  Furthermore, since $P(x)$ has degree $4$, these two roots must come in pairs.  Thus, the roots of $P(x)$ are $\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}}$, $\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{6}}$, $-\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}}$, and $-\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{6}}$.\n\nLet $a = \\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}}$ and $b = \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{6}}$.
