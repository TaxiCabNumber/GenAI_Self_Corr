        "inference": "Since $ABCD$ is a square, $AB = BC = CD = DA$.  Furthermore, $AB = BD - AD$ and $BC = AC - AB$, so $BD - AD = AC - AB$, which means $BD = AC$.  The distance from $(k,0)$ to $(3,0)$ is $3 - k$, and the distance from $(0,0)$ to $(\\sqrt{9 - k^2},0)$ is $\\sqrt{9 - k^2}$.  Thus, $3 - k = \\sqrt{9 - k^2}$.  Squaring both sides, we get $9 - 6k + k^2 = 9 - k^2$, which simplifies to $2k^2 - 6k = 0$.  We can factor to get $2k(k - 3) = 0$, so $k = 0$ or $k = 3$.
