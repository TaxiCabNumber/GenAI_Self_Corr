        "inference": "The problem asks to minimize the sum of the absolute differences between the numbers in the sequence $x, 2x, 3x, ..., 119x$ and the number 1. \n\nThe solution provided is incorrect. It assumes that the minimum is achieved when the middle term of the sequence is equal to 1. However, this is not necessarily true.  \n\nHere's the correct approach:\n\n* **Symmetry:** Notice that the sum of the distances from the numbers in the sequence to 1 will be minimized when the numbers are distributed symmetrically around 1. \n\n* **Minimizing the sum:**  To minimize the sum of the distances, we should aim to have half the numbers less than 1 and half the numbers greater than 1.  \n\n* **Finding x:** Since we have 119 numbers, the 60th number (the middle number) should be as close to 1 as possible. This means that $60x$ should be as close to 1 as possible. To make it as close as possible, we should set $x = \\frac{1}{60}$.\n\n* **Calculating the sum:** With $x = \\frac{1}{60}$, the first 59 numbers will be less than 1, and the last 60 numbers will be greater than 1.  The sum of the distances for the first 59 numbers will be $\\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} + ... + \\frac{59}{60}$, and the sum of the distances for the last 60 numbers will be the same.\n\n* **Simplifying:**  The sum of the distances can be simplified as $\\frac{1}{60} \\cdot (1 + 2 + ... + 59) + \\frac{1}{60} \\cdot (1 + 2 + ... + 59)$. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we get $\\frac{1}{60} \\cdot \\frac{59 \\cdot 60}{2} + \\frac{1}{60} \\cdot \\frac{59 \\cdot 60}{2} = 59$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression is $\\boxed{59}$. \n",
