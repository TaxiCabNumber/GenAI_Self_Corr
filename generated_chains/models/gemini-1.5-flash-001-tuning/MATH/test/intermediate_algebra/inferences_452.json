        "inference": "Since the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$, the degree of $p(x)$ must be less than the degree of $q(x)$.  Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, $p(x)$ must be linear.  Let $p(x) = ax+b$.  Since $p(2) = 2$, we have $2a+b = 2$.\n\nSince $q(x)$ is quadratic and has a zero at $x=2$ (because of the vertical asymptote), we have $q(x) = c(x-2)(x-d)$ for some constants $c$ and $d$.  Since $q(-1) = 18$, we have $c(-3)(-1-d) = 18$, or $c(d+1) = 6$.  We also know that $q(1) = 0$ because of the hole at $x=1$, so $c(-1)(-1-d) = 0$, which means $d = -1$.  Therefore, $c = 3$, and $q(x) = 3(x-2)(x+1) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6$.\n\nNow we have $p(x) = ax + b$ and $q(x) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6$, and we know $2a + b = 2$.  We also know that the hole occurs at $x=1$, so $p(1) = q(1) = 0$.  Therefore, $a + b = 0$, and we can solve the system of equations to find $a = 2$ and $b = -2$.  Hence, $p(x) = 2x-2$ and $q(x) = 3x^2 - 3x - 6$, and $p(x) + q(x) = \\boxed{3x^2 - x - 8}$.  Final Answer: $\\boxed{3x^2 - x - 8}$. I hope it is correct.",

Since $q(x)$ is a quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0,$ $p(x)$ must be linear (have degree 1).\n\nSince we have a hole at $x=1$, there must be a factor of $x-1$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.
