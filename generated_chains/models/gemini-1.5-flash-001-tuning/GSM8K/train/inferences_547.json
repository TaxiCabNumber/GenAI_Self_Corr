At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom decides to renovate a house.  There are 3 bedrooms and each bedroom takes 4 hours to renovate.  The kitchen takes 50% longer than each bedroom.  The living room took twice as much time as everything else combined.  How long did everything take?",
