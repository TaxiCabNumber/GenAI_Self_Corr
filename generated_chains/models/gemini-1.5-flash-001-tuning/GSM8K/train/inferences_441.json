At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartin is organizing a party, and he invited many of his colleagues. He invited 5 people from his hometown and twice as many people from his school. Martin invited also as many people from his sports club as the sum of people invited from his hometown and his school. The remaining invitations represent 20% of the total previously mentioned. How many people can potentially come to the party Martin is organizing?",
