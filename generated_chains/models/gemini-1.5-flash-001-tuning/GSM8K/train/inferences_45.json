At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn pi\u00f1ata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $94 \n",
        "ground_truth": "The four bags of Reese's cost $9 x 4 = $<<9*4=36>>36.\nThe three bags of Snickers cost $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nThe five bags of Skittles cost $7 x 5 = $<<7*5=35>>35.\nTherefore, the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $<<13+36+15+35=99>>99.\n#### 99"
