At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSteve wanted to make a total of $100 within four days, so he took on a berry-picking job in Sweden. The job paid $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. On Monday he picked 8 pounds. Tuesday\u2019s harvest was triple what he had picked the previous day. On Wednesday he felt very tired and decided to rest. How many pounds of lingonberries did Steve have to pick on Thursday?",

        "ground_truth": "On Monday, Steve was paid 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 dollars\nTuesday\u2019s harvest was 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 pounds\nThe 24 pounds Steve picked on Tuesday gave him 24 * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 dollars\nSo, the amount Steve earned from the first two days on the job is 16 +48 = <<16+48=64>>64 dollars\nSince Steve rested on Wednesday, he made 0 dollars, meaning his earnings were 64 + 0 = <<64+0=64>>64 dollars\nThe difference between Steve\u2019s earnings and his target is 100 - 64 = <<100-64=36>>36 dollars\nSince he was paid 2 dollars for each pound of lingonberries, Steve needed to pick 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 pounds\n#### 18"
