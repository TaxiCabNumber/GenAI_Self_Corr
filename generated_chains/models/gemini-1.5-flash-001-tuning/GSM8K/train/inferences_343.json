At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKim's TV uses 125 watts of electricity per hour.  She runs it for 4 hours a day.  If electricity cost 14 cents per kw/h how many cents does her TV cost to run for a week?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 560 $cents$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=3500>>3500 watt hours/week\nThis is 3500 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<3500/1000=3.5>>3.5 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 3.5 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<3.5*0.14=0.49>>0.49/week\n#### 49"
