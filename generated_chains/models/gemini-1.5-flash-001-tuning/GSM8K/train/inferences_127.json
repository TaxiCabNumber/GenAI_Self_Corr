At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThree cats sat on a fence, meowing at the moon.  The first cat meowed 3 times per minute.  The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat.  And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?",

        "ground_truth": "The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the three meows per minute from the first cat, for a total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 meows per minute.\nThe third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat, for a total of 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 meows per minute.\nThus, combined, the three cats meow 3+6+2=<<3+6+2=11>>11 times per minute.\nIn five minutes, the three cats meow 5*11=<<5*11=55>>55 times.\n#### 55"
