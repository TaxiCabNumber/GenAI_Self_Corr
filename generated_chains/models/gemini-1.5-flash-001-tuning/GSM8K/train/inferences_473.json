At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames and Ali together own $250. If you know that James owns $40 more than Ali, then calculate the amount owned by James.",

The amount owned by Ali is X - $40.\nThe total amount owned by both of them X + (X - $40) = $250.\nCombining like terms, we get X*2 - $40 = $250.\nAdding $40 to both sides, we get X*2 = $290.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get X = $145.\n#### 145"
