At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrank needs to meet a quota at work for his sales. It\u2019s the beginning of the month and in 30 days he needs to have 50 cars sold. The first three days he sold 5 cars each day. Then the next 4 days he sold 3 cars each day. If the month is 30 days long how many cars does he need to sell for the remaining days to meet his quota?",

        "ground_truth": "On days one, two, and three he sold 5 cars each day so, 5 cars + 5 cars + 5 cars = <<5+5+5=15>>15 cars that he sold on those days.\nOn days 4,5,6 and 7 he sold 3 cars each day so, 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars + 3 cars = <<3+3+3+3=12>>12 cars that he sold on those days.\nNow we combine the cars he has already sold, which is 15 cars, and 12 cars, so 15 cars + 12 cars = <<15+12=27>>27 cars are sold in total.\nIf he needs to sell 50 cars and has already sold 27 cars then 50 cars - 27 cars = <<50-27=23>>23 cars left to sell to meet his quota.\n#### 23"
