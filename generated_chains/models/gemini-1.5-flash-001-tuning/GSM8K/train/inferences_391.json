At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony decided he wanted to be an astronaut.  He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.  He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?",
