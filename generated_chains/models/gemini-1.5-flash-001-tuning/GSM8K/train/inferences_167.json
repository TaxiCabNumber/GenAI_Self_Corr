At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJanet filmed a new movie that is 60% longer than her previous 2-hour long movie.  Her previous movie cost $50 per minute to film, and the newest movie cost twice as much per minute to film as the previous movie.  What was the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film?",

        "ground_truth": "The first movie was 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 minutes\nSo this movie is 120*.6=<<120*.6=72>>72 minutes longer\nSo this movie is 192 minutes\nIt also cost 50*2=$<<50*2=100>>100 per minute to film\nSo it cost 192*100=$1920\n#### 1920"
