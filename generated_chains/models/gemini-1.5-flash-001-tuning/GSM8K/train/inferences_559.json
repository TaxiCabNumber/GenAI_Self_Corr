At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLuna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget while her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. If the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, how much is Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses?",

        "ground_truth": "Let x be Luna's house rental budget.\nThe total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.\nThe equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.\nThus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.\nSo, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.\nHer phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.\nTherefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $<<240+9=249>>249.\n#### 249"
