At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAnnie is trying to figure out whether it's safe to drive her truck. For every 3 degrees the temperature drops below 32 degrees, Annie's chances of skidding on ice increase 5%. If she goes into a skid, she has a 40% of regaining control. Otherwise, she'll have a serious accident. If the temperature is 8 degrees, what is the percentage chance of Annie getting into a serious accident if she drives?",
