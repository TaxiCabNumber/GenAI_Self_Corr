At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBucky earns money each weekend catching and selling fish. He wants to save up for a new video game, which costs $60. Last weekend he earned $35. He can earn $5 from trout and $4 from blue-gill. He caught five fish this Sunday. If 60% were trout, and the rest were blue-gill, how much more does he need to save before he can buy the game?",
