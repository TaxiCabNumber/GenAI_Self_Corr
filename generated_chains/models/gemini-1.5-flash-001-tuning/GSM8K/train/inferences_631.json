At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary and Rose went shopping to buy presents. They spent the same amount. Mary bought two pairs of sunglasses for $50 each and a pair of jeans for $100.  Rose bought a pair of shoes at $150 and two decks of basketball cards. How much did one deck of basketball cards cost?",

        "ground_truth": "Two pairs of sunglasses costs 2 x $50 = $<<2*50=100>>100.\nSo, Mary spent $100 + $100 = $<<100+100=200>>200.\nThus, two decks of basketball cards costs $200 - $150 = $<<200-150=50>>50.\nTherefore, one deck of basketball cards costs $50/2 = $<<50/2=25>>25.\n#### 25"
