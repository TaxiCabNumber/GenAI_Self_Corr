At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSara is checking out two different stores to buy a computer. The first store offers a device for $950 with a 6% discount. The second sells the same computer for \u20ac920 with a 5% discount. What is the difference in price between the two stores?",

        "ground_truth": "The amount of discount in the first store 950 x 6/100 = $<<950*6/100=57>>57.\nSo, the device costs 950 - 57 = $<<950-57=893>>893 in the first store.\nThe amount of discount in the second store is 920 x 5/100 = $<<920*5/100=46>>46.\nSo, the device costs 920 - 46 = $<<920-46=874>>874 in the second store.\nThe difference in price is 893 - 874 = $<<893-874=19>>19.\n#### 19"
