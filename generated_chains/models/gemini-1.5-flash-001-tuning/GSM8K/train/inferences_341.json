As he walked across the porch afterward, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. How many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept if there were 331 after he walked across it?",

Therefore, before he walked across it, there were 331-223 = 108 dust particles.\nSince he cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, this means that 1/10 of the original number of dust particles is equal to 108. \nSo, there were 108 x 10 = 1080 dust particles before Samuel swept.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1080$ \n",
