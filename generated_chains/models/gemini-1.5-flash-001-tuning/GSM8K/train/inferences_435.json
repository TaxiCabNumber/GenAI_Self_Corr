At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase. As this was not enough, she asked her mother to give her the remaining amount. Her mother offered her $250 and told her that she needs to earn the rest working during the holidays. How much money must Maria earn to be able to buy the bike she wants?",
