At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income. \n \n We know that $0.4x$ represents her previous spending on rent and utilities. After her salary increase, her spending on rent and utilities is $0.25(x + 600)$. \n \n Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remained the same, we can set up the following equation: \n \n $0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)$\n \n Expanding the right side of the equation:\n \n $0.4x = 0.25x + 150$\n \n Subtracting $0.25x$ from both sides:\n \n $0.15x = 150$\n \n Dividing both sides by $0.15$:\n \n $x = 1000$\n \n I hope it is correct: $1000\n",
