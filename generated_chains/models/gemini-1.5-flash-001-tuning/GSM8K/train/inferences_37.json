At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFive friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?",

        "ground_truth": "The cost of 5 pieces of hamburger is $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nThe cost of 4 sets of French fries is $1.20 x 4 = $<<1.20*4=4.80>>4.80.\nThe cost of 5 cups of soda is $0.5 x 5 = $<<0.5*5=2.50>>2.50.\nSo their total bill is $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 +$2.7 = $<<15+4.8+2.5+2.7=25>>25.\nHence, each of the five friends will contribute $25/5 = $<<25/5=5>>5.\n#### 5"
