At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNoah is a painter. He paints pictures and sells them at the park. He charges $60 for a large painting and $30 for a small painting. Last month he sold eight large paintings and four small paintings. If he sold twice as much this month, how much is his sales for this month?",

        "ground_truth": "Noah earned $60/large painting x 8 large paintings = $<<60*8=480>>480 for the large paintings.\nHe also earned $30/small painting x 4 small paintings = $<<30*4=120>>120 for the small paintings.\nHis total sales last month were $480 + $120 = $<<480+120=600>>600.\nSo, his sales this month are $600 x 2 = $<<600*2=1200>>1200.\n#### 1200"
