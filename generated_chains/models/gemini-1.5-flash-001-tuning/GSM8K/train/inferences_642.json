At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony has to run several errands in a day.  He needs to drive 10 miles to get groceries, 15 miles to get a haircut and 5 miles to go to a doctor's appointment.  How many miles will Tony have driven when he is halfway through driving around for his errands?",

        "ground_truth": "First, we need to find the total number of miles Tony will be driving by adding 10+15+5=<<10+15+5=30>>30 miles in total.\nTo determine the halfway point, we simply divide the total number of miles by 2, performing 30/2=<<30/2=15>>15 miles driven when Tony is halfway done.\n#### 15"
