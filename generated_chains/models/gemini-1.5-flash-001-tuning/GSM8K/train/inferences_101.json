        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $36$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss * 2 tubes of lip gloss per tub of lip gloss = <<6*2=12>>12 tubes of lip gloss.\nSo she must be applying makeup to 12 tubes of lip gloss * 3 people per tube of lip gloss = <<12*3=36>>36 people.\n#### 36"
