At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA laboratory has 22 beakers of liquid in a fume hood, and 8 of the beakers have copper ions in them. Adding three drops of a solution will turn the liquid in a beaker blue if there are copper ions present. If the beakers are tested one by one for copper ions and 45 drops are used before all 8 beakers with copper ions are found, how many beakers without copper ions were tested?",
