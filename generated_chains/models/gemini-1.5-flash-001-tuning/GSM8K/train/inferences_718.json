        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake and Penny are hunting snakes. Jake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's snake. If the two snakes have a combined length of 70 inches, how long is Jake's snake?",
        "inference": "Let's say Jenny's snake is 'x' inches long. \nJake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's, so Jake's snake is 'x + 12' inches long.\nTogether, their snakes are 70 inches long, so x + (x + 12) = 70\nCombining like terms, we get 2x + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 58\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 29 inches.\nSo, Jenny's snake is 29 inches long. \nJake's snake is 12 inches longer than Jenny's, so Jake's snake is 29 + 12 = 41 inches long.\nI hope it is correct: 41 inches $answer$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let j be the length of Jake's snake and p be length of Penny's snake. We know that j + p = 70, and j = p + 12.\nWe can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get p + 12 + p = 70\nCombining like terms, we get 2p + 12 = 70\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2p = 58\nDividing both sides by 2, we get p = 58 / 2 = <<58/2=29>>29 inches. Penny's snake is 29 inches.\nSubstituting that length in to the equation j = p + 12, we get j = 29 inches + 12 inches = <<29+12=41>>41 inches\n#### 41"
