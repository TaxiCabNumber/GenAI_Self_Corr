At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBryan works as a social media account manager. He does marketing posts, advertisement posts, and customer outreach posts. His client has him spend four hours on customer outreach posts and half that time on advertisement posts each day. Bryan works eight hours a day. How much time in hours each day does he spend on marketing posts?",
