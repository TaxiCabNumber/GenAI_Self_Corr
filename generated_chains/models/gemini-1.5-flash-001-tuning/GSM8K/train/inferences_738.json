At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom Sawyer has tricked his friends into whitewashing Aunt Polly's 100-foot fence. His first friend, Ben, whitewashed 10 feet. His second friend Billy whitewashed a fifth of the remaining fence. A third friend, Johnny, whitewashed a third of the fence that was left after that. How much of the fence still needs to be whitewashed?",
