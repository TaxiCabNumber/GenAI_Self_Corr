At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim collects model cars, and he has 301 models total.  Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys.  How many Buicks does Jim have?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of Chevys.\nThen 2x + 3 is the number of Fords.\nAnd 4(2x + 3) is the number of Buicks.\nSo x + (2x + 3) + 4(2x + 3) = 301.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x + 2x + 3 + 8x + 12 = 301.\nCombining like terms, we get: 11x + 15 = 301.\nSubtracting 15 from both sides, we get: 11x = 286.\nDividing both sides by 11, we get: x = 26.\nSo Jim has 4(2(26) + 3) = 4(52 + 3) = 4(55) = 220 Buicks.\n\nI hope it is correct: 220 $Buicks$ \n",
