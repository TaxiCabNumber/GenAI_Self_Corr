At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA bear is preparing to hibernate for the winter and needs to gain 1000 pounds. At the end of summer, the bear feasts on berries and small woodland animals. During autumn, it devours acorns and salmon. It gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries during summer, and during autumn, it gained twice that amount from acorns. Salmon made up half of the remaining weight it had needed to gain. How many pounds did it gain eating small animals?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 200 $pounds$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "The bear gained 1 / 5 * 1000 = <<1/5*1000=200>>200 pounds from berries.\nIt gained 2 * 200 = <<2*200=400>>400 pounds from acorns.\nIt still needed 1000 - 200 - 400 = <<1000-200-400=400>>400 pounds.\nThus, it gained 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 pounds from salmon.\nTherefore, the bear gained 400 - 200 = <<400-200=200>>200 pounds from small animals.\n#### 200"
