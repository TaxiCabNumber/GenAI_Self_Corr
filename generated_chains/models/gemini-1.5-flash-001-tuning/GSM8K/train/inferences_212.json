At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRandy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday \u2013 Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?",
