At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUki owns a bakery. She sells cupcakes at $1.50 each, cookies at $2 per packet, and biscuits at $1 per packet. In a day, she can bake an average of twenty cupcakes, ten packets of cookies, and twenty packets of biscuits.  How much will be her total earnings for five days?",

        "ground_truth": "Uki earns 20 x $1.50 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30 in selling 20 cupcakes.\nShe earns 10 x $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 for selling 10 packets of cookies,\nAdditionally, she earns another 20 x $1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 for selling twenty packets of biscuits.\nThus, in a day, she earns an average of $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.
