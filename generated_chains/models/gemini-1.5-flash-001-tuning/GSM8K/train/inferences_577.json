At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAt a roller derby, 4 teams are competing. Each team is made up of 10 members, and each member needs a pair of roller skates to compete in and another pair of skates as a backup. None of the skates have laces yet, so each member is offered 3 sets of laces per pair of skates. How many sets of laces have been handed out?",
