At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBran's tuition fee is $90. He does a part-time job that pays him $15 per month and he has a scholarship that takes care of 30% of his tuition fee. If he needs to pay his tuition fee within 3 months, how much does Bran still need to pay?",

        "ground_truth": "Bran's scholarship pays $90 x 0.30 = $<<90*0.30=27>>27 to his tuition fee.\nSo, the total amount he still needs to pay is $90 - $27 = $<<90-27=63>>63.\nAnd Bran will be able to earn $15 x 3 = $<<15*3=45>>45 after working for 3 months.\nTherefore, the total amount he still needs to pay is $63 - $45 = $<<63-45=18>>18.\n#### 18"
