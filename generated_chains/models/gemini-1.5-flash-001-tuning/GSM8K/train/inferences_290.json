At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA family has three adults and children, both girls and boys. They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?",
