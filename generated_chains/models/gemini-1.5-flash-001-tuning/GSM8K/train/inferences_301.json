At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\n240 sixth-grade students were asked about the number of novels they read per month. 1/6 of students read three or more novels, 35% of students read two novels, 5/12 of students read one novel, and the rest of the students do not read anything. Calculate the number of students who do not read novels.",

So 84 students read two novels.\n5/12 * 240 students = <<5/12*240=100>>100 students.
