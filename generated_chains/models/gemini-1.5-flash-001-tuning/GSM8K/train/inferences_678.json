At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBelinda can throw a ball at a speed of 20 feet/second. If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?",
