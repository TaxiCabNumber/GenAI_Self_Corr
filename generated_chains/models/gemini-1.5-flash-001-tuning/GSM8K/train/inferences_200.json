At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?",

        "ground_truth": "Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 every day by selling three 8-inch portraits.\nThe price of the 16-inch portrait is $5 x 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 each.\nSo, she earns $10 x 5 = $<<10*5=50>>50 every day by selling five 16-inch portraits.\nHer total earnings is $50 + $15 = $<<50+15=65>>65 every day.\nTherefore, the total amount she earns after 3 days is $65 x 3 = $<<65*3=195>>195.\n#### 195"
