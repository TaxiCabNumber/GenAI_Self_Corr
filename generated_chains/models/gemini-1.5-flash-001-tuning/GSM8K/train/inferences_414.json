At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?",

        "ground_truth": "The second drink was 2/12=1/6 the size of the first drink\nSo it had 1/6*3=1/2 the caffeine\nThat means it had 1/2*250=<<250/2=125>>125 grams of caffeine\nSo the total amount of caffeine he drank was 125+250=<<125+250=375>>375 grams\nSo he consumed 375*2=<<375*2=750>>750 grams of caffeine for the day\n#### 750"
