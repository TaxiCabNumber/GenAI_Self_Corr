At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJimmy is going to sell pizzas at the carnival to make some money. The carnival only gave him 7 hours to do so. He bought a 22kg sack of flour to make his pizzas and he takes 10 min to make each pizza for the customers. At the end of the 7 hours, he saw some flour was left. Knowing that each pizza needs 0.5kg of flour to make, how many pizzas can he make to bring home with the flour left?",

        "ground_truth": "Each hour Jimmy makes 60min \u00f7 10min/pizza = <<60/10=6>>6 Pizzas\nThe number of total pizzas made equals 7 hours x 6 pizzas/hour = <<7*6=42>>42 pizzas\nThe amount of total flour used equals 42 pizzas x 0.5 kg/pizza = <<42*0.5=21>>21 kg\nThe amount of flour left equals 22 kg - 21 kg = <<22-21=1>>1 kg\nThe number of pizzas Jimmy can make is 1kg \u00f7 0.5kg/pizza = <<1/0.5=2>>2 pizzas\n#### 2"
