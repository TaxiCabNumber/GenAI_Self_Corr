At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot. He had to walk through every row in Section G and Section H to find it. Section G has 15 rows that each hold 10 cars. Section H has 20 rows that each hold 9 cars. If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?",

        "ground_truth": "First find the number of cars in Section G by multiplying the number of rows by the number of cars per row: 15 rows * 10 cars/row = <<15*10=150>>150 cars\nThen do the same thing for Section H: 20 rows * 9 cars/row = <<20*9=180>>180 cars\nThen add the two quantities of cars to find the total number of cars Nate walked past: 150 cars + 180 cars = <<150+180=330>>330 cars\nFinally, divide the number of cars Nate passed by the numbers he passes each minute to find how long he spent searching: 330 cars / 11 cars/minute = <<330/11=30>>30 minutes\n#### 30"
