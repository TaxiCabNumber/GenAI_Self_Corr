At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLibby is building an igloo in her backyard using bricks of snow. She builds her igloo in rows, using a total of 10 rows of bricks of snow. The bottom half of the igloo has 12 bricks of snow in each row while the top half of the igloo has 8 bricks of snow in each row. How many bricks of snow did Libby use for her igloo?",
