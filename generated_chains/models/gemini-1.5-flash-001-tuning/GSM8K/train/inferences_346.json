At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLucille is painting her room. Two of her walls are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The final wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall. If each can of paint covers 2 square meters, how many cans of paint does Lucille need?",

        "ground_truth": "For the first set of walls, each wall covers 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<3*2=6>>6 square meters.\nThere are two of these walls, so this becomes a total of 6 meters * 2 walls = <<6*2=12>>12 square meters.\nThe third wall covers 5 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<5*2=10>>10 square meters.\nThe final wall covers 4 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<4*2=8>>8 square meters.\nSo in total, the paint needs to cover 12 + 10 + 8 = <<12+10+8=30>>30 metres.\nSince each can covers 2 meters, Lucille needs 30 meters / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 cans of paint.\n#### 15"
