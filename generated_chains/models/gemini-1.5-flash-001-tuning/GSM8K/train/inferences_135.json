Subtract 600 from both sides: 4B = 9400 \n\n2. Divide both sides by 4: B = 2350\n\nI hope it is correct: 2350 $square feet$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of square feet in Benedict's house be x. So, we can write the equation 4 * x + 600 = 10000.\nSubtracting 600 from both sides we get 4 * x = 9400\nDividing both sides by 4 we get x = 2350 square feet.\n#### 2350"
