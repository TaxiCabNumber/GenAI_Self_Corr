At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFor every 1 minute that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance?",

        "ground_truth": "For each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta spends 6 * 3 minutes = <<6*3=18>>18 minutes practicing.\nFor each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta throws tantrums for 6 * 5 minutes = <<6*5=30>>30 minutes.\nThus, in total, for each 6 minutes of performance time, she spends 18 minutes + 30 minutes + 6 minutes = 54 minutes on all three activities.\n#### 54"
