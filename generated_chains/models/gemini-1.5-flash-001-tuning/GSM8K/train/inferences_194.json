At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Grey is purchasing gifts for his family. So far he has purchased 3 polo shirts for $26 each; 2 necklaces for $83 each; and 1 computer game for $90. Since Mr. Grey purchased all those using his credit card, he received a $12 rebate. What is the total cost of the gifts after the rebate?",

        "ground_truth": "Mr. Grey paid $26/shirt x 3 shirts = $<<26*3=78>>78 on polo shirts.\nHe paid $83/necklace x 2 necklaces = $<<83*2=166>>166 on necklaces.\nSo, he paid $78 + $166 + $90 = $<<78+166+90=334>>334 for the gifts.\nAfter the rebate, the total cost of the gifts is now $334 - $12 = $<<334-12=322>>322.\n#### 322"
