At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBert fills out the daily crossword puzzle in the newspaper every day. He uses up a pencil to fill out the puzzles every two weeks. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil. How many words are in each crossword puzzle on average?",
