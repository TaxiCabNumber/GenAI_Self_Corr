At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSantana has 7 brothers. 3 of them have birthdays in March, 1 of them has a birthday in October, 1 has a birthday in November, and another 2 of them were born in December. If Santana always buys each of her brothers a birthday present and a Christmas present, how many more presents does she have to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year?",
