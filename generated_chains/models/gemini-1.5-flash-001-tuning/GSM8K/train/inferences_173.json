At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?",
