At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlice and Emily are selling oranges at the farmer's market. Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. In total, they sold 180 oranges. How many oranges did Alice sell?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of oranges Emily sold with the variable \"x\".\n\nSince Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, Alice sold 2x oranges.\n\nTogether, they sold x + 2x = 180 oranges.\n\nCombining like terms, we get 3x = 180.\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3x / 3 = 180 / 3.\n\nThis gives us x = 60.\n\nTherefore, Emily sold 60 oranges.\n\nAlice sold twice as many oranges as Emily, so Alice sold 2 * 60 = 120 oranges.\n\nI hope it is correct: 120$ \n",
