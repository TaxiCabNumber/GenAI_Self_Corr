At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhen it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.  The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?",

        "ground_truth": "The medium-sized hole leaks at a rate of one-half that of the largest hole, or 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 ounces per minute.\nThe small-sized hole leaks at a rate of one-third that of the medium-sized hole, or 1.5/3=<<1.5/3=0.5>>0.5 ounces per minute.\nCombined, the three holes leak at a rate of 3+1.5+0.5=<<3+1.5+0.5=5>>5 ounces per minute.\nSince one hour is 60 minutes, two hours is 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nIn total, over the two hours, the three holes will leak a combined 120*5=<<120*5=600>>600 ounces of water.\n#### 600"
