At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?",

        "ground_truth": "The number of guests that bring a plus one is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 guests\nThe total number of guests at the party, including the plus ones, is 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 guests\nSince there are 3 courses, Wickham will need 45 * 3 = <<45*3=135>>135 plates\n#### 135"
