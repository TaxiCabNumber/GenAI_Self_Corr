At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nValerie needs to put stamps on the envelopes she is about to mail. She has thank you cards for each of her grandmother, uncle and aunt for the birthday presents they sent. She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?",
