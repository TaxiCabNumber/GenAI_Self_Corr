At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTracy, Michelle, and Kati take a road trip that is a total of 1000 miles.  Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, and Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives. How many miles does Michelle drive?",
        "inference": "Let's break down the problem:\n\n* **Let x represent the number of miles Katie drives.**\n* **Michelle drives 3 times the amount Katie drives, so Michelle drives 3x miles.**\n* **Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle's amount, meaning Tracy drives 2(3x) + 20 miles, which simplifies to 6x + 20 miles.**\n* **The total distance of the road trip is 1000 miles, so the sum of the miles driven by each person equals 1000: x + 3x + 6x + 20 = 1000**\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n* **Combine like terms: 10x + 20 = 1000**\n* **Subtract 20 from both sides: 10x = 980**\n* **Divide both sides by 10: x = 98**\n\nWe've found that Katie drives 98 miles.  Remember that Michelle drives 3 times the amount Katie drives, so Michelle drives 3 * 98 = 294 miles.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 294 miles** \n",
