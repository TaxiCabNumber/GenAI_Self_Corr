At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLisa is looking to attempt a World Record. She has decided to try and match Joey Chestnut's record of eating 75 full hotdogs, buns included, in 10 minutes. Halfway through the time Lisa has eaten 20 hotdogs. How many hotdogs will she have to eat per minute to at least tie Joey Chestnut's record?",
