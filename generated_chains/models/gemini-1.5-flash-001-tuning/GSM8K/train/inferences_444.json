At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nReggie and his brother are having a basketball shooting contest. They each get to take 10 shots. Layups are worth 1 point, free throws are worth 2 points, and anything further away is worth 3 points. Reggie makes 3 layups, two free throws, and one long shot. His brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. How many points does Reggie lose by?",
