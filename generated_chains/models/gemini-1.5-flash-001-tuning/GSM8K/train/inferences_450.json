At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFlora has been experiencing frequent fractures. Dr. Juan has asked her to strengthen her bones by drinking 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks. Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough, but her brother says she'll still need to drink more. To fulfill Dr. Juan\u2019s requirement, how many more gallons must Flora drink daily?",

        "ground_truth": "3 weeks translate to 3 * 7 days = <<3*7=21>>21 days.\nTo meet Dr. Juan\u2019s recommendation would mean drinking 105/21 = <<105/21=5>>5 gallons daily.\nThis means that Flora must drink 5 -3 = <<5-3=2>>2 more gallons daily.\n#### 2"
