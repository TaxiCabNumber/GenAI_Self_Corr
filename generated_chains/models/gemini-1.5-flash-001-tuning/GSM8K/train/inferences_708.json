At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRobi Ney wants to fill a 120-liter tub. He is amused by letting the water run for 1 minute, then closing the water supply for 1 minute, and so on alternating opening and closing the water supply. But the cap at the bottom of the tub is not very airtight and lets 1 liter of water escape per minute. The flow rate of the tap is 12 liters per minute. How long does it take to fill the tub in minutes?",
