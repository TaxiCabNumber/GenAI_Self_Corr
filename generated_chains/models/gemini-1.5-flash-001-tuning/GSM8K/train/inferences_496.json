At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMichael has a lot of matchsticks at home and decides to use them to make miniature models. As he is about to start crafting, he has second thoughts and decides to only use half of his pile of matchsticks. He creates 30 matchsticks houses. If he has now used all of the matchsticks he intended to and each matchstick house uses 10 matchsticks, how many matchsticks did Michael have originally?",
