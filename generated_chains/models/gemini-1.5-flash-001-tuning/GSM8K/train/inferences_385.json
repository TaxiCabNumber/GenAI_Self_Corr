        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhen the strawberries at Fruity Farm are ready for harvest, Miguel charges each interested picker $4 to access the strawberry fields. Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $7$ pounds \n",
        "ground_truth": "To gain entry into the strawberry fields, Sally, Jenny and Moses paid a total of 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 dollars\nThis means that before Miguel applied the $12 discount, the cost was 128 + 12 = <<128+12=140>>140 dollars\nWe get the weight by dividing the cost by the price of strawberries per pound, 140/20 = <<140/20=7>>7 pounds\n#### 7"
