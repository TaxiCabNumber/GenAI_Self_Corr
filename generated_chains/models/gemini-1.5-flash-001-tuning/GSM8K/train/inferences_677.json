At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Caiden wants to do repairs to his house and requires 300 feet of metal roofing to do this. If each foot of roofing costs $8, and the supplier of the metal roofing brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free, how much money is Mr. Caiden required to pay for the remaining metal roofing?",

        "ground_truth": "The supplier brought 300 ft - 250 ft = <<300-250=50>>50 fewer feet of metal roofing.\nTherefore the total amount of money Mr. Caiden has to pay for the remaining metal roofings is 50 feet * $8/foot = $<<50*8=400>>400\n#### 400"
