At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of games Carla won.\nFrankie won x/2 games.\nTogether they won x + x/2 games, which is equal to 30.\nWe can write this as an equation: x + x/2 = 30\nCombining like terms, we get 3x/2 = 30\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get 3x = 60.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 20.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of games that Frankie won.\nThen the number of games Carla won would be 2*x.\nAnd the sum of all the games would be x+2*x=30 games.\nThus, the expression simplifies to 3*x=30.\nAnd the value of x=<<10=10>>10 games.\nTherefore, the number of Carla's wins would be 2x=20 games.\n#### 20"
