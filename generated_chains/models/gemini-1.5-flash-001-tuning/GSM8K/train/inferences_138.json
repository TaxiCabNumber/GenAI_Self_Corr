At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA gallon of whole milk that normally costs $3 is now sold at $2. A box of cereal was sold at a discount of $1. How much will you save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $14$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "The discount for each gallon of whole milk is $3 - $2 = $<<3-2=1>>1.\nSo the discount for 3 gallons of whole milk is $1/gallon x 3 gallons = $<<1*3=3>>3.\nThe total discount for 5 boxes of cereal is $1/box x 5 boxes = $<<1*5=5>>5.\nYou will save $3 + $5 = $<<3+5=8>>8 for 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal.\n#### 8"
