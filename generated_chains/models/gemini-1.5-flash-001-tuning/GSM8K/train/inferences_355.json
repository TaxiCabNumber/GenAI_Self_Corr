At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarla has a grid of squares that has 10 rows and 15 squares in each row. She colors 4 rows of 6 squares in the middle of the grid with red. She colors all squares on the first 2 and last 2 rows with blue. Then she colors the rest with green. How many squares does Marla color green?",
