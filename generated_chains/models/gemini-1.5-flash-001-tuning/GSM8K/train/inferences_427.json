At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEver since she was a little girl, Sheila has dreamed of traveling the world. To help fund her dream, she bought a large piggy bank in December and started saving. By last week, she had saved $3,000. Pleased with her progress, she has decided to continue saving $276 per month, for 4 years. Today, Sheila\u2019s family secretly added $7,000 into the piggy bank. At the end of 4 years, how much money will be in Sheila\u2019s piggy bank?",

        "ground_truth": "Today, Sheila\u2019s piggy bank has $3000 + $7000 = $<<3000+7000=10000>>10000\nSheila will be saving for 4 years which is equivalent to 12 months/year * 4 years = <<12*4=48>>48 months\nIn 4 years, she will save $276/month * 48 months = $<<276*48=13248>>13248\nThe piggy bank will have a total of $10,000 + $13,248 = $<<10000+13248=23248>>23248\n#### 23248"
