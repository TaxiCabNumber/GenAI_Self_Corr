At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMadeline has 5 boxes with 24 crayons in each. She noticed that 5/8 of the crayons in the 2 boxes were not yet used. In the 2 other boxes, only 2/3 of the crayons were used while the last box was not entirely used. How many unused crayons did Madeline have?",

        "ground_truth": "Two boxes of crayons have 24 x 5/8 = <<24*5/8=15>>15 unused crayons from each box.\nSo, a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 unused crayons are in the two boxes.\nFor the other 2 boxes, there are 24 x 2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 used crayons from each box.\nHence, there are 24 - 16 = <<24-16=8>>8 unused crayons.\nSo, a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 unused crayons are in the other two boxes.\nTherefore, Madeline has a total of 30 + 16 + 24 = <<30+16+24=70>>70 unused crayons.\n#### 70"
