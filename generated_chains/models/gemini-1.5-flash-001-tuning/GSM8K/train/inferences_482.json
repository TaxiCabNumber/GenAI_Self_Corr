At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIan is looking to lose some weight.  He decides to start jogging around his apartment complex every night to burn some calories.  He does 5 laps around the complex every night.  Each lap is 100 feet.  If it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, how many calories does Ian burn after 5 days of jogging like this?",

        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine how many feet Ian runs in a week. We begin this by multiplying the number of laps by the number of feet per lap, performing 5*100= <<5*100=500>>500 feet per day.\nSince there are 5 days in the period being measured, this means Ian runs 500*5= <<2500=2500>>2500 feet jogged.\nSince it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn a calorie, this means Ian burns 2500/25=<<2500/25=100>>100 calories burned jogging throughout the week.\n#### 100"
