At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBert's golden retriever has grown tremendously since it was a puppy.  At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds, but doubled in weight by week 9.  It doubled in weight again at 3 months old, and doubled again at 5 months old.
