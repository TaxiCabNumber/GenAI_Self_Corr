At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",

        "ground_truth": "Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years\u2019 ship.\nThe second hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.\nThe third hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = <<2*2=4>>4S people.\nAll the ships had S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847 people.\nThus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121 people on it.\n#### 121"
