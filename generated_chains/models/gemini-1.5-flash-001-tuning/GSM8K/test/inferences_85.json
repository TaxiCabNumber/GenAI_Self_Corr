At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has one shirt from each vacation he has been on. Every shirt is its own quilt block. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?",
