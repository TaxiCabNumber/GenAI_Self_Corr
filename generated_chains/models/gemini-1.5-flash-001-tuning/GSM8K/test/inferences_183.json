At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct:  **10 seconds** \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.\nOn the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.\nThus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.\nTherefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.\n#### 2"
