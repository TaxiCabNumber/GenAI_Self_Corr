At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAt the end of the school year, Kate asked her teacher if she could have the 3 boxes of 64 crayons since they were all worn down to small pieces.  The teacher agreed.  Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes.
