At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, bought beads. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?",
