At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 7500 $cents$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.\nFrom Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.\nSince Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.\nThus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.\nThus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.\n#### 7500"
