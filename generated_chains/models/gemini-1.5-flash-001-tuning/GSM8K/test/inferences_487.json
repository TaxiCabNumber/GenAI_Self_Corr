At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?",
