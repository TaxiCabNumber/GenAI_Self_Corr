At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFord owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?",

        "ground_truth": "The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.\nThe second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.\nThe third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.\nSo the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.\nThe total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160\nTherefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.\n#### 100"
