        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $4$ trips \n",
        "ground_truth": "The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.\nHe is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.\nHe is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.\nHe is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2"
