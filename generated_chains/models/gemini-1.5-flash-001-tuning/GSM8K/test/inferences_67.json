At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: #### $525$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.\nThere were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.\nSo, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.\n#### 595"
