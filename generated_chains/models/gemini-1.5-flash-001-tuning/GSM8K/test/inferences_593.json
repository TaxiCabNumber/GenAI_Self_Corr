At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?",

        "ground_truth": "To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet\nTo find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet\nTo find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.\n#### 3"
