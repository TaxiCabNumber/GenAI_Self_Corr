At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?",

        "ground_truth": "The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.\nTherefore in 2 months, the total number of bananas they need is 700x2= <<700*2=1400>>1400.\n#### 1400"
