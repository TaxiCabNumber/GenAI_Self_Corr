At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.  He drives at a speed of 70 mph.  He had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip.  After he gets there he takes a route home that is 240 miles but he goes 80 mph.  How long did the trip take?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct:  **4.25 hours** \n",
        "ground_truth": "The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles\nSo he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours\nThe second route took 240/80=<<240/80=3>>3 hours\nSo in total he drove 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 hours\n#### 6"
