At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?",
