At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",

        "ground_truth": "Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.\nThe 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.\nThe ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.\nThe raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.\nThus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.\n#### 48"
