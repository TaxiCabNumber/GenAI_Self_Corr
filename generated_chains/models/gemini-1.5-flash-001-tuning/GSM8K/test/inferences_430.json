At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCharlotte went into the kitchen supply store knowing she wanted a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00 and 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each.  At check out, the clerk told her everything was 20% off.  How much was her order?",

        "ground_truth": "She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00\nThe utensils are $25, the pots and pans are $120 and the mixing bowls are $20 for a total of 25+120+20 = $<<25+120+20=165>>165\nEverything is 20% off, and her total is $165 so 165*.20= $<<165*.20=33.00>>33.00\nThe total was $165 and she gets a $33.00 discount so 165-33 = $<<165-33=132.00>>132.00 is her total price\n#### 132"
