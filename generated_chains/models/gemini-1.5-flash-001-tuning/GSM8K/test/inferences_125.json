At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJulia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.  She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.  While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ represent the number of spoons Julia bought in the package. \n\n* Julia had $x$ spoons from her package.\n* Her husband added 5 spoons.\n* She used 3 spoons.\n* In total, Julia had 12 spoons.\n\nWe can write this as an equation: $x + 5 - 3 = 12$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: $x + 2 = 12$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get: $x = 10$\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $spoons$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.\nSince the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.\n#### 10"
