At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits their daughter. To make a Spanish flan, she needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has been tasked to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser, how many times does Sandra have to babysit?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs needed\n45 eggs needed / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions \nI hope it is correct: 5 $answer$ \n",
