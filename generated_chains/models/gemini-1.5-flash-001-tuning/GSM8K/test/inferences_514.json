At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: $90,000 \n",
        "ground_truth": "Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.\nThe cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.\n#### 90000"
