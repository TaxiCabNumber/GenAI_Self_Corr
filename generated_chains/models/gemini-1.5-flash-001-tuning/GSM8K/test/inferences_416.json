        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of camels.\nSince each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.\nEach camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 \u2013 x = 304 humps.\nx = 304 \u2013 180\nx = <<124=124>>124\nSo, there are 124 camels and 180 \u2013 124 = 56 dromedaries.\n#### 56"
