At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?",
