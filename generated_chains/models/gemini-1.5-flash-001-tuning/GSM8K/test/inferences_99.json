At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain with?",

        "ground_truth": "Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants\nTomorrow, Mary\u2019s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.\n#### 58"
