        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?",
        "inference": "I hope it is correct: 10800 $kWh$ \n",
        "ground_truth": "An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.\nAn air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.\nSo, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.\nThat is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.\nHence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.\n#### 81"
