        "inference": "Let Brooke's current age be 'b' and Seth's current age be 's'. \n\nWe know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so: \ns = 2b\n\nIn two years, Brooke will be b+2 years old and Seth will be s+2 years old. The sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so:\n\n(b+2) + (s+2) = 28\n\nSubstituting s = 2b into the equation, we get:\n\n(b+2) + (2b+2) = 28\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3b + 4 = 28\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n3b = 24\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nb = 8\n\nTherefore, Brooke is 8 years old. \n\nSince Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is 2*8 = 16 years old.\n\nI hope it is correct:  16 $answer$ \n",
