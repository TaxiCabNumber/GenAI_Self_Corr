At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHeather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",

        "ground_truth": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12"
