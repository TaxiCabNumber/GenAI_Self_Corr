At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMorisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?",
