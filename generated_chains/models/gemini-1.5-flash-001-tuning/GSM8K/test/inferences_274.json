At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt's April, and Mrs. Rylan has been busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season. She has bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds to plant. If a packet of tomato seeds costs $40 and a packet of celery seeds costs $30, how much money did she use to buy the seeds?",

        "ground_truth": "The total amount of money she used to buy the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $<<20*40=800>>800\nThe celery seeds cost her 80 packets * $30/packet = $<<80*30=2400>>2400\nFor the seeds, Mrs. Rylan paid $2400 + $800 = $<<2400+800=3200>>3200\n#### 3200"
