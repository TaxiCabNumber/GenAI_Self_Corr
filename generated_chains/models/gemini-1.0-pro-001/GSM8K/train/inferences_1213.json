At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLyssa and Precious took an English proficiency exam. Lyssa answered 20% of the items incorrectly. Precious got 12 mistakes. How many more correct answers did Lyssa get than precious if there were 75 items in the exam?",

Now let's find out how many items Lyssa answered correctly. 75 items - 15 incorrect items = 60 correct items.\n3. Precious got 12 mistakes, so she answered 75 items - 12 incorrect items = 63 correct items.\n4. Lyssa got 60 correct answers, while Precious got 63 correct answers. Therefore, Lyssa got 63 - 60 = 3 more correct answers than Precious.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3",
