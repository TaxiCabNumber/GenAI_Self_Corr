At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAndy started out the year weighing 156 pounds. He then grew 3 inches and gained 36 pounds. Andy wasn't happy with his weight and decided to exercise. Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. How much less does Andy weigh now than at the beginning of the year?",
        "inference": "1. Andy was 156 pounds at the beginning of the year.\n2. He grew 3 inches and gained 36 pounds. Therefore, he now weighs 156 + 36 = 192 pounds.\n3. Over the next 3 months, he lost an eighth of his weight every month. Therefore, he lost 1/8 of 192 pounds = 24 pounds each month.\n4. He lost weight for 3 months, so he lost a total of 24 * 3 = 72 pounds.\n5. Therefore, Andy now weighs 192 - 72 = 120 pounds.\n6. He weighs 120 - 156 = -36 pounds less than at the beginning of the year.\n\nI hope this is correct: -36 pounds",
