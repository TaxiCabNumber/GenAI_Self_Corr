At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nElizabeth uses $3.00 worth of ingredients to make a  bag of granola.  She makes 20 bags and sells them for $6.00 a bag at the farmer's market.  An hour before closing, she has sold 15 bags and marks the remaining 5 bags down to $4.00 and sells them soon after.  What is her net profit?",

Total revenue from discounted sales: $4.00 x 5 = $20.00\n\n4. Total revenue: $90.00 + $20.00 = $110.00\n\n5. Net profit: $110.00 - $60.00 = $50.00\n\n**Answer:** I hope it is correct: $50.00",
