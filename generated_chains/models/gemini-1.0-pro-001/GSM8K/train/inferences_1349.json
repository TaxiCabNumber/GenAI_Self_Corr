At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEmerson and his friends love rowing and don't miss the sport on weekends. Starting in the morning, Emerson rowed and was 6 miles away from his starting point on a particular weekend. He continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed, only stopping for a while for rest before covering the remaining 18 miles. What's the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip?",
        "inference": "1. He rowed and was 6 miles away from his starting point.\n2. He continued for another 15 miles, so until this moment he covered 6 + 15 = 21 miles\n3. He covered the remaining 18 miles, so until this moment he covered 21 + 18 = 39 miles\nI hope it is correct: 39 $miles$",
        "ground_truth": "After the first 6 miles, he rowed 15 miles more, reaching 6+15 = <<6+15=21>>21 miles.\nAfter resting, he adds 18 miles more, which is 18+21 = <<18+21=39>>39 miles\n#### 39"
