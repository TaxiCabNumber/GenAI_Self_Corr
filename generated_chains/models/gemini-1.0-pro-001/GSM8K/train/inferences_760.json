At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSusan wants to throw a party for her mom. She is planning on having 30 guests. For dinner she is making a recipe that makes 2 servings each. Each batch of the recipe calls for 4 potatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt. A potato costs $.10 and a container of salt costs $2 at the supermarket. If each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, how much money will Susan spend on food?",
        "inference": "1. Susan needs to make 15 batches of the recipe to feed 30 guests.\n2. Each batch requires 4 potatoes, so she needs 60 potatoes.\n3. Potatoes cost $0.10 each, so she will spend $6 for potatoes.\n4. Each batch requires 1 teaspoon of salt, so she needs 15 teaspoons of salt.\n5. Each container of salt has 5 teaspoons, so she needs 3 containers of salt.\n6. Containers of salt cost $2 each, so she will spend $6 for salt.\n7. Total cost of food: $6 + $6 = $12.\n\nI hope it is correct: $12 $",
        "ground_truth": "Susan needs to make 30/2=<<30/2=15>>15 batches of the recipe.\nTherefore, she will need 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 potatoes.\nShe will also need 1*15=<<1*15=15>>15 teaspoons of salt.\nThus she will have to buy 15/5 =<<15/5=3>>3 containers of salt.\nTherefore, she will spend 60*$.1=$6 on potatoes and 3*$2=$6 on salt.\nThus, she will spend $6+$6=$<<6+6=12>>12 on food.\n#### 12"
