At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBen starts each day with $50, spends $15 every day and saves the rest. After a few days, his mom doubled his total savings and his dad gave him an additional $10. If he now has $500, How many days have elapsed?",

After his dad gave him $10, he had $30x + $10 = $500\n5. Solving for x, we get: $30x + $10 = $500\n6. $30x = $490\n7. x = $490 / $30\n8. x = 16.33 days.\nI hope it is correct: 16.33 days",
