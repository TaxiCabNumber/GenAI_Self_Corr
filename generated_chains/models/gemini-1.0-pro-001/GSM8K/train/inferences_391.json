He went to college for 4 years to get a degree in science.  He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?",

He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years. So, 8 + 2 = 10 years\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 years",
