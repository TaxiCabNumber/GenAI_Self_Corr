At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoan is at the grocery store. She has a total of $60 to spend. She is going to purchase 2 containers of hummus, which are $5 each. She is going to purchase chicken for $20, bacon for $10, and vegetables for $10. She wants to purchase apples which are $2 each. With her remaining money, how many apples can she purchase?",

Determine the remaining amount of money after purchasing the other items.\n$$Remaining money = $60 - $45 = $15$$\n\n3. Calculate the number of apples that can be purchased with the remaining money.\n$$Number of apples = $15 \u00f7 $2 = 7.5$$\n\n4. Since Joan cannot purchase a fraction of an apple, the final answer should be rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n$$Number of apples = 7$$\n\n**I hope it is correct: Number of apples: $7**",
