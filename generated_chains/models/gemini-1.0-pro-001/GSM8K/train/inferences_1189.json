        "inference": "1. Yolanda scored 345 points over the entire season.\n2. She averaged 4 free throws (worth one point), so she scored 4 * 15 = 60 points from free throws.\n3. She also averaged 5 two-point baskets per game, so she scored 5 * 2 * 15 = 150 points from two-point baskets.\n4. Therefore, she scored 60 + 150 = 210 points from free throws and two-point baskets combined.\n5. Since she scored 345 points over the entire season, she must have scored 345 - 210 = 135 points from three-point baskets.\n6.
