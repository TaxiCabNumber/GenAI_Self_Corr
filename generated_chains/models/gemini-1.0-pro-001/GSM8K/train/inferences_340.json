At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories.   One story is 10 feet.  The only rope being sold is 20 feet long but you lose 25% when lashing them together.  How many pieces of rope will he need to buy?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate length of 6 stories: 6 * 10 feet = 60 feet\n2. Calculate how much rope is lost when lashing: 20 feet * 0.25 = 5 feet\n3. Calculate how many 15-foot ropes he needs: 60 feet / 15 feet = 4 ropes\nI hope it is correct: 4 ropes",
        "ground_truth": "He needs 10*6=<<10*6=60>>60 feet\nHe loses 20*.25=<<20*.25=5>>5 feet each time\nSo he gets 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 feet from each piece\nThat means he needs 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 pieces of rope\n#### 4"
