At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake splits 8 shots of vodka with his friend.  Each shot of vodka is 1.5 ounces.  If the vodka is 50% pure alcohol, how much pure alcohol did Jake drink?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total amount of vodka Jake drank:\nTotal vodka = 8 shots x 1.5 ounces per shot = 12 ounces\n\n2. Calculate the amount of pure alcohol in the vodka:\nPure alcohol = 50% x 12 ounces = 6 ounces\n\n3. Determine how much pure alcohol Jake drank:\nJake's pure alcohol = 6 ounces / 2 (since he split the vodka with his friend) = 3 ounces\n\nI hope it is correct: Final Answer: 3 ounces",
