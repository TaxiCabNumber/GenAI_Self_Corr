        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames collects all the fruits from his 2 trees.  Each tree has 20 plants.  Each plant has 1 seed and he plants 60% of those.  How many trees did he plant?",
        "inference": "1) Calculate the number of seeds collected:\n20 plants x 2 trees = 40 plants\n1 seed x 40 plants = 40 seeds\n\n2) Calculate the number of seeds planted:\n40 seeds x 60% = 24 seeds\n\n3) Determine the number of trees planted:\n24 seeds / 1 seed per tree = 24 trees\n\nI hope it is correct: 24",
        "ground_truth": "He got 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seeds\nThat means he plants 40*.6=<<40*.6=24>>24 trees\n#### 24"
