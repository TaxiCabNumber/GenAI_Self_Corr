At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJenny is planning her catering budget for her wedding. She's going to have 80 guests. 3 times as many guests want steak as chicken. If each steak entree costs $25 and each chicken entree costs $18, how much is the total catering budget?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the number of guests who want steak.\nGuests who want steak = 3 * guests who want chicken\nGuests who want steak = 3 * (80 - guests who want steak)\nGuests who want steak = 3 * 80 - 3 * guests who want steak\n4 * guests who want steak = 240\nGuests who want steak = 60\n\n2. Determine the number of guests who want chicken.\nGuests who want chicken = 80 - guests who want steak\nGuests who want chicken = 80 - 60\nGuests who want chicken = 20\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the steak entrees.\nCost of steak entrees = number of guests who want steak * cost of each steak entree\nCost of steak entrees = 60 * $25\nCost of steak entrees = $1500\n\n4. Calculate the cost of the chicken entrees.\nCost of chicken entrees = number of guests who want chicken * cost of each chicken entree\nCost of chicken entrees = 20 * $18\nCost of chicken entrees = $360\n\n5. Calculate the total catering budget.\nTotal catering budget = cost of steak entrees + cost of chicken entrees\nTotal catering budget = $1500 + $360\nTotal catering budget = $1860\nI hope it is correct: $1860$",
        "ground_truth": "Let s be the number of guests who want steak and c be the number who want chicken. We know that s + c = 80 and s = 3c.\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 3c + c = 80\nCombining like terms, we get 4c = 80\nDividing both sides by 4, we get c = 20\nThen multiply the number of guests who want chicken by the cost of each chicken entree: 20 guests * $18/guest = $<<20*18=360>>360\nThen triple the number of guests who want chicken to find the number who want steak: 20 guests * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 guests\nThen multiply the number of guests who want steak by the cost of each steak entree: 60 guests * $25/guest = $<<60*25=1500>>1500\nThen add the cost of the steak and chicken entrees to find the total cost: $1500 + $360 = $<<1500+360=1860>>1860\n#### 1860"
