At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn gets a bonus that's the same percentage every year.  Last year he made $100,000 and got a $10,000 bonus.  This year he makes $200,000.  How much will John make this year when adding both his total pay and bonus together?",

        "ground_truth": "First we need to determine the bonus percentage, which is found by dividing the bonus amount by the amount John made for the year, taking 10,000/100,000= <<10000/100000=.10>>.10, or 10 percent.\nThen, we take John's earnings from this year and multiply them by the same percentage, taking 200,000*.1= 20,000 dollars in bonuses\nWe then add these two numbers together, for a total of 200,000+20,000= <<200000+20000=220000>>220,000 dollars.\n#### 220000"
