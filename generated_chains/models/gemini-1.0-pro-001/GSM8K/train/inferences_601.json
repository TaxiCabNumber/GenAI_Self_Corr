At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA cheetah can run at a top speed of 60 mph.  The gazelle can run for speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.  If one mile per hour is about 1.5 feet per second, then how many seconds would it take for a cheetah traveling at top speed to catch up to a fleeing gazelle also running at top speed if the two animals were initially 210 feet apart and they both traveled in the same direction?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the speeds of the cheetah and gazelle to feet per second:\n\nCheetah: 60 mph * (5280 ft / 1 mi) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 88 ft/s\nGazelle: 40 mph * (5280 ft / 1 mi) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 58.67 ft/s\n\n2. Calculate the relative speed of the cheetah relative to the gazelle:\n\nRelative speed = Cheetah's speed - Gazelle's speed\n= 88 ft/s - 58.67 ft/s\n= 29.33 ft/s\n\n3. Convert the initial distance between the two animals to seconds:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= 210 ft / 29.33 ft/s\n= 7.16 s\n\nI hope it is correct: $7.16$",
        "ground_truth": "60 mph is 60*1.5=<<60*1.5=90>>90 feet per second.\n40 mph is 40*1.5=<<40*1.5=60>>60 feet per second.\nThus, for every second, the cheetah advances on the gazelle by 90-60=<<90-60=30>>30 feet per second.\nTo close on a distance of 200 feet, it would take the cheetah 210/30=7 seconds to catch the gazelle.\n#### 7"
