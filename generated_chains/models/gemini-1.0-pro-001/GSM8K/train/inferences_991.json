At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are six unicorns in the Enchanted Forest. Everywhere a unicorn steps, four flowers spring into bloom. The six unicorns are going to walk all the way across the forest side-by-side, a journey of 9 kilometers. If each unicorn moves 3 meters forward with each step, how many flowers bloom because of this trip?",

Calculate the total number of steps the unicorns will take: \nDistance = 9 kilometers = 9000 meters.  \nSteps = Distance/Step size = 9000 meters / 3 meters = 3000 steps. \n\n2.  Calculate the total number of flowers that will bloom: \nFlowers per step = 4 \nTotal flowers = Flowers per step * Total steps = 4 * 3000 = 12000. \n\nI hope it is correct: 12000",
        "ground_truth": "First convert the total length of the journey from kilometers to meters: 9 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = <<9*1000=9000>>9000 meters\nThen divide this by the length of one step to find the number of steps in the journey: 9000 meters / 3 meters/step = <<9000/3=3000>>3000 steps\nThen multiply the number of steps by the number of flowers per step to find how many flowers one unicorn creates on the journey: 3000 steps * 4 flowers/step = <<3000*4=12000>>12000 flowers\nThen multiply the number of flowers per unicorn by the number of unicorns to find the total number of flowers created: 12000 flowers/unicorn * 6 unicorns = 72,000 flowers\n#### 72000"
