At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA flagpole is 12 feet tall. It breaks, folding over in half, such that what was the tip of the flagpole is now dangling two feet above the ground. How far from the base, in feet, did the flagpole break?",
        "inference": "The flagpole broke 4/3 of the way up from the ground.\n\nLet x be the height at which the flagpole broke.\n\nWe know that the flagpole is 12 feet tall, so the height of the broken part is 12 - x.\n\nWe also know that the broken part is dangling two feet above the ground, so the height of the broken part is also x - 2.\n\nSetting these two expressions equal, we get:\n\n12 - x = x - 2\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the flagpole broke 7 feet from the ground.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
        "ground_truth": "The break occurred (12-2)/2=5 feet from the top.\nThen it was 12-5=<<12-5=7>>7 feet from the base.\n#### 7"
