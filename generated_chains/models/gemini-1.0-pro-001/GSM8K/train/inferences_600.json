At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMike can type 65 words per minute. Due to a minor accident, Mike cannot use his right hand for a while so that his typing speed is now 20 words less per minute. If he is supposed to type a document with 810 words, how many minutes will it take him to finish typing the document?",
        "inference": "1. Mike's typing speed without his right hand = 65 - 20 = 45 words per minute\n2. Number of minutes to type 810 words = 810 / 45 = 18 minutes\nI hope it is correct: 18",
        "ground_truth": "After the accident, Mike can only type 65 words/minute - 20 words/minute = <<65-20=45>>45 words/minute.\nSo, he will be able to finish typing the document in 810 words / 45 words/minute = <<810/45=18>>18 minutes.\n#### 18"
