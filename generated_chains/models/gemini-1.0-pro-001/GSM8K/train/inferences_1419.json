At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn preparation for his mountain climbing, Arvin wants to run a total of 20 kilometers in a week. On the first day, he ran 2 kilometers. On each subsequent day, he increased his running distance by 1 kilometer over the previous day. If he runs for 5 days a week, how many kilometers did he run on the 5th day?",
