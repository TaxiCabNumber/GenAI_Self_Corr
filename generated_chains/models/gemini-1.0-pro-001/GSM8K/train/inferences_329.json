At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSamuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts and Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts. They planned to share the doughnuts evenly with their 8 other friends. How many doughnuts will each of them receive?",
