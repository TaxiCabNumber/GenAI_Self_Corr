At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames is a first-year student at a University in Chicago. He has a budget of $1000 per semester. He spends 30% of his money on food, 15% on accommodation, 25% on entertainment, and the rest on coursework materials. How much money does he spend on coursework materials?",

Multiply the budget by each decimal to find the amount James spends on each category:\n   - Food: $1000 x 0.30 = $300\n   - Accommodation: $1000 x 0.15 = $150\n   - Entertainment: $1000 x 0.25 = $250\n3. Add the amounts spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment to find the amount James spends on coursework materials:\n   - Coursework materials: $1000 - $300 - $150 - $250 = $300\nI hope it is correct: $300",
        "ground_truth": "Accommodation is 15% * $1000=$<<15*.01*1000=150>>150\nFood is          30% * $1000=$<<30*.01*1000=300>>300\nEntertainment is   25% * $1000=$<<25*.01*1000=250>>250\nCoursework materials are thus $1000-($150+$300+$250) = $300\n#### 300"
