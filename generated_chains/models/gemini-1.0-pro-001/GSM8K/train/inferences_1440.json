They played a total of 20 games, and won 14 games, lost 2, and drew the rest of the matches. They earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and nothing for a loss. How many points did they have at the end of the season?",

So, for 14 wins, they earned 14 * 3 = 42 points.\n\nFor each draw, they earn 1 point. So, for 4 draws, they earned 4 * 1 = 4 points.\n\nTherefore, the total number of points they earned is 42 + 4 = 46 points.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 46**",
