At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSimon wanted to buy flowers that his mom could plant for Mother's Day.  The garden center was offering 10% off all purchases.  He bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each, one hydrangea that cost $12.50 and 5 petunias that cost $1.00 each.  If he paid with a $50 bill, how much change would Simon receive back from his purchase?",

Add the cost of the pansies, hydrangea, and petunias: $12.50 + $12.50 + $5.00 = $30.00\n4. Calculate the discount: $30.00 x 10% = $3.00\n5. Subtract the discount from the total cost: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00\n6. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $50.00 - $27.00 = $23.00\nI hope it is correct: $23.00$",
