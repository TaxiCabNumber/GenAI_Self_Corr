At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of purple flowers:\n80% more means 1.8 times as many. So, the number of purple flowers is 10 x 1.8 = 18.\n\n2. Calculate the number of green flowers:\n25% as many means 0.25 times as many. So, the number of green flowers is (10 + 18) x 0.25 = 7.\n\n3. Add up the number of flowers of all colors:\nThe total number of flowers is 10 + 18 + 7 = 35.\n\nI hope it is correct: 35",
        "ground_truth": "There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.\n#### 35"
