At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLorenzo put three full cans of thumbtacks into his pocket and went off to work at the corkboard factory. It was Lorenzo's job, as head of quality control, to test every cork board for its ability to hold thumbtacks.  He placed one thumbtack from each of the three cans of thumbtacks into every board tested.  At the end of the day, he had tested 120 boards and had 30 tacks remaining in each of the three cans.  What was the total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Lorenzo used one thumbtack from each of the three cans for every cork board he tested. \n**Step 2**: Thus, for 120 cork boards he used 120 * 3 = 360 tacks.\n**Step 3**: The total combined number of thumbtacks from the three full cans is:\n**I hope it is correct: 360 + 3 * 30 = 450 $answer$**",
        "ground_truth": "At the end of the day, he had tested 120 boards, each with three tacks, for a total of 3*120=<<120*3=360>>360 tacks\nHe had 30 tacks remaining in each of the three cans, for an additional 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 thumbs tacks.\nTherefore, the original total combined number of thumbtacks in the three full cans of thumbtacks was 360+90=<<360+90=450>>450 thumbtacks.\n#### 450"
