At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLao is farming chickens. He can sell each chicken for $1.50. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Each chicken will need 2 pounds of feed from the time it hatches to the time he sells it. If he makes $65 profit from selling chickens, how many did he sell?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of chickens Lao sold.\nThen, the total amount of money he made from selling the chickens is 1.50x.\nThe total cost of the feed he used is (2/20) * 2x = 0.20x.\nHis profit is the difference between the amount of money he made from selling the chickens and the cost of the feed, which is equal to 1.50x - 0.20x = 1.30x.\nSince he made $65 profit, we have 1.30x = 65.\nDividing both sides by 1.30, we get x = 50.\nTherefore, Lao sold 50 chickens.\n\nI hope it is correct: 50",
        "ground_truth": "A bag of feed is enough for 10 chickens because 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10\nEach chicken costs $.2 to raise because 2 / 10 = <<2/10=.2>>.2\nEach chicken results in $1.3 of profit because 1.5 - .2 = <<1.5-.2=1.3>>1.3\nHe sells 50 chickens because 65 / 1.3 = <<65/1.3=50>>50\n#### 50"
