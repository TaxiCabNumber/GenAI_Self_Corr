At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPhyllis has two gardens. In the first garden, she has 20 plants and 10% are tomato plants. In the second garden, she has 15 plants and 1/3 of these plants are tomato plants. What percentage of all the plants in her two gardens are tomato plants?",
