She sold 10 peaches to her friends for $2 each, while 4 other peaches were sold to her relatives for $1.25 each, and she left the other one for herself. How much did she earn after selling 14 peaches?",

Calculate the total amount of money received from selling 4 peaches to relatives:\n4 peaches * $1.25 per peach = $5\n3. Add the amounts of money received from both groups:\n$20 + $5 = $25\n4.
