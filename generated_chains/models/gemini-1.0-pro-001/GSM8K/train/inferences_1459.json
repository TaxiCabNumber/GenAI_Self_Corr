There are 3 other people in the house and everyone drinks 2 cups of coffee a day.  It takes .5 ounces of coffee per cup of coffee.  If coffee costs $1.25 an ounce, how much does he spend on coffee a week?",

Calculate the total amount of coffee consumed per day: 7 cups/day x 0.5 ounces/cup = 3.5 ounces/day\n3. Determine the total amount of coffee consumed per week: 3.5 ounces/day x 7 days/week = 24.5 ounces/week\n4. Calculate the cost of the coffee: 24.5 ounces/week x $1.25/ounce = $30.63/week\n\nI hope it is correct: $30.63",
