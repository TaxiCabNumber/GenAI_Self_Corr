At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill is buying healthcare on an exchange. The normal monthly price of the plan he wants is $500. The government will pay for part of this cost depending on Bill's income: 90% if he makes less than $10,000, 50% if he makes between $10,001 and $40,000, and 20% if he makes more than $50,000. Bill earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month. How much will Bill spend for health insurance in a year?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* First, we need to find Bill's monthly income. He earns $25/hour and works 30 hours per week, four weeks per month, so his monthly income is $25 * 30 * 4 = $3,000.\n* Next, we need to see how much the government will pay. Since Bill makes more than $40,000, the government will pay 20%.\n* So, the government will pay 20% * $500 = $100 per month.\n* Therefore, Bill will pay $500 - $100 = $400 per month.\n* Finally, to find how much Bill will spend in a year, we multiply by 12: $400 * 12 = $4,800.\n\n**Answer:**\nI hope it is correct: 4800 $",
        "ground_truth": "First find how much money Bill makes every week by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours he works each week: $25/hour * 30 hours/week = $<<25*30=750>>750/week\nThen multiply that number by the number of weeks per month to find his monthly earnings: $750/week * 4 weeks/month = $<<750*4=3000>>3,000/month\nThen multiply his monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to find his annual income: $3,000/month * 12 months/year = $<<3000*12=36000>>36,000/year.\nThis income means Bill gets a 50% monthly healthcare subsidy from the government. Multiply the cost of the premium by 50% to find the monthly cost Bill pays: $500/month * .5 = $<<500*.5=250>>250/month\nFinally, multiply Bill's monthly cost by the number of months in a year to find his annual cost: $250/month * 12 months/year = $<<250*12=3000>>3,000/year\n#### 3000"
