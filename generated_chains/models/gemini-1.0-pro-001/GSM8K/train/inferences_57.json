At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLiza bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?",
