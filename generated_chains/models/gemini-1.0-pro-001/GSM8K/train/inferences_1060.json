At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBarbie enjoys buying jewelry. One day, she bought 12 pairs of earrings, and gave half of them to Alissa, making Alissa's total number of collections to be triple the number of earrings she was given. How many earrings does Alissa have now?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nBarbie initially has 12 pairs of earrings. She gives half of them, or 6 pairs, to Alissa.\n\nAlissa's total number of collections is triple the number of earrings she was given, or 3 * 6 = 18 pairs.\n\nTherefore, Alissa now has 18 pairs of earrings.\n\nI hope it is correct: 18",
        "ground_truth": "If 1 pair of earrings equals 2 earrings, then Barbie bought 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 earrings.\nHalf of 24 earrings is 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 earrings\nIf receiving 12 earrings tripled Alissa's collection, then she now has 12*3=<<12*3=36>>36 earrings.\n#### 36"
