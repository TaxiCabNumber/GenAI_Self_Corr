At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPorche has 3 hours to get all her homework done. Her math homework takes her 45 minutes. Her English homework takes her 30 minutes. Her science homework takes her 50 minutes. Her history homework takes her 25 minutes. She also has a special project due the next day. How much time does she have left to get that project done?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Convert all the times to hours.  \n- Math homework: 45 minutes = 0.75 hours  \n- English homework: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours  \n- Science homework: 50 minutes = 0.83 hours  \n- History homework: 25 minutes = 0.42 hours  \n\n\n**Step 2**: Add up the time it takes to complete all the homework assignments.  \n- Total homework time: 0.75 hours + 0.5 hours + 0.83 hours + 0.42 hours = 2.5 hours  \n\n\n**Step 3**: Subtract the total homework time from the total available time to find the time left for the special project.  \n- Time left for special project: 3 hours - 2.5 hours = 0.5 hours  \n\n\n**Final Answer**  \n> I hope it is correct: 0.5 or 30 minutes",
