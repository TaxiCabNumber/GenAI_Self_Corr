At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAllyn is a golfer. At the starting tee, he hit the golf ball and it traveled 180 yards straight toward the hole.  On his second turn, he hit the ball again straight toward the hole and it traveled half as far as it did on his first turn, but the ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole.  On his third swing, he hit the ball onto the green and it rolled into the hole.  What is the distance, in yards, from the starting tee to the hole?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. The ball traveled 180 yards on the first turn.\n2. On the second turn, the ball traveled half as far as it did on the first turn, which is 180/2 = 90 yards.\n3. The ball landed 20 yards beyond the hole on the second turn, so the distance from the starting tee to the hole is 90 + 20 = 110 yards.\n\nI hope it is correct: 110 yards",
        "ground_truth": "On his second turn, the ball traveled 180/2=<<180/2=90>>90 yards.\nAfter two turns, the ball had traveled 180+90=<<180+90=270>>270 yards.\nSince, after the second turn, the ball was 20 yards past the hole, this means the distance from the starting tee to the hole was 270-20=<<270-20=250>>250 yards.\n#### 250"
