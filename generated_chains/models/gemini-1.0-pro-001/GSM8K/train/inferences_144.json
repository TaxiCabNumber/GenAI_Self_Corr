At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe owner of a Turkish restaurant wanted to prepare traditional dishes for an upcoming celebration. She ordered ground beef, in four-pound packages, from three different butchers. The following morning, the first butcher delivered 10 packages. A couple of hours later, 7 packages arrived from the second butcher. Finally, the third butcher\u2019s delivery arrived at dusk. If all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers weighed 100 pounds, how many packages did the third butcher deliver?",
        "inference": "The first butcher delivered 10 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, for a total of 10 x 4 = 40 pounds.\nThe second butcher delivered 7 packages, each weighing 4 pounds, for a total of 7 x 4 = 28 pounds.\nSo, the third butcher delivered 100 - 40 - 28 = 32 pounds of ground beef.\nTo find the number of packages, we divide the total weight by the weight of each package: 32 \u00f7 4 = 8 packages.\nI hope it is correct: 8 $packages$",
        "ground_truth": "Since each package weighed 4 pounds, the first butcher delivered 10 * 4 = <<10*4=40>>40 pounds\nThe second butcher's delivery was 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 pounds\nThe first two butchers therefore delivered 40 + 28 = <<40+28=68>>68 pounds\nSubtracting that weight from the total weight of ground beef gives 100 - 68 = <<100-68=32>>32 pounds\nIt therefore means the third butcher delivered 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 packages.\n#### 8"
