She spent $x on taxes.\n4. She had $18 left over.\n\nUsing the information above, we can set up the following equation:\n\n```\n$80 - $42 - $x = $18\n```\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n```\n$38 - $x = $18\n```\n\nSubtracting $18 from both sides:\n\n```\n$20 = $x\n```\n\nTherefore, Angie paid $20 in taxes this month.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 $",
        "ground_truth": "Angie earned 80 and paid 42 for necessities, so she had 80 - 42 = $<<80-42=38>>38 left.\nAngie had 18 left after paying taxes, so her share of the taxes was 38- 18 = $20 this month.\n#### 20"
