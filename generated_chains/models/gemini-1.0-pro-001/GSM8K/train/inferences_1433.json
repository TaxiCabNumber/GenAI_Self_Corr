At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAmong the career home run leaders for MLB, Hank Aaron has 175 fewer than twice the number that Dave Winfield has.  Hank Aaron hit 755 home runs.  How many home runs did Dave Winfield hit in his career?",
