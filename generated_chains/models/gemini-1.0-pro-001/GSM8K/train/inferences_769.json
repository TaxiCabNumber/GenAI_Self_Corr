At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill put his french fries in the oven after it finished heating.  The recommended time was 5 minutes for them to be fully cooked.  He put them in for 45 seconds.  How many seconds remained?",

Subtract the time Bill put the fries in for from the recommended time: 5 minutes - 0.75 minutes = 4.25 minutes.\n3.
