        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKim's TV uses 125 watts of electricity per hour.  She runs it for 4 hours a day.  If electricity cost 14 cents per kw/h how many cents does her TV cost to run for a week?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the amount of power the TV uses from watts to kilowatts.\n125 watts = 0.125 kilowatts\n\n2. Multiply the power used by the number of hours run per day.\n0.125 kilowatts * 4 hours/day = 0.5 kilowatt-hours/day\n\n3. Multiply the kilowatt-hours used per day by the number of days in a week.\n0.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 7 days/week = 3.5 kilowatt-hours/week\n\n4. Multiply the kilowatt-hours used per week by the cost of electricity.\n3.5 kilowatt-hours/week * 14 cents/kilowatt-hour = 49 cents/week\n\nI hope it is correct: 49 $cents$",
        "ground_truth": "She uses 4 hours/day * 125 watts/hour=<<4*125=500>>500 watt hours/day\nThat means she uses 500 watt hours/day * 7 days/week = <<500*7=3500>>3500 watt hours/week\nThis is 3500 watt hours / 1000 watts/kw = <<3500/1000=3.5>>3.5 kw hours\nSo her TV cost 3.5 kw hours/week * $0.14/kw hour = $<<3.5*0.14=0.49>>0.49/week\n#### 49"
