At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJonas is a book collector.  He has so many books he is converting his third bedroom into a library.  This room has 400 square feet of space.  He plans to put several bookshelves in the room and each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space.  If he reserves 160 square feet of space to use for a desk and some walking space, how many shelves can he put in the room?",

He has 400 - 160 = 240 square feet of space left for bookshelves.\n4. Each bookshelf takes up 80 square feet of space.\n5. He can put 240 / 80 = 3 bookshelves in the room.\nI hope it is correct: 3",
