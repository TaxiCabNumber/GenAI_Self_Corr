At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoey studies for his SAT exams 2 hours per night 5 nights a week.  On the weekends, he studies 3 hours a day.  If his SAT exam is 6 weeks away, how much time will Joey spend studying?",
