At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA driver travels 30 miles per hour for 3 hours and 25 miles per hour for 4 hours to deliver goods to a town every day from Monday to Saturday. How many miles does the driver travel in a week?",
        "inference": "1. The driver travels 30 miles per hour for 3 hours, so the distance covered is 30 * 3 = 90 miles.\n\n2. The driver travels 25 miles per hour for 4 hours, so the distance covered is 25 * 4 = 100 miles.\n\n3. The driver travels from Monday to Saturday, so the total number of days is 7 days.\n\n4. The driver travels 90 miles on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and 100 miles on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. So, the total distance covered in a week is (90 * 3) + (100 * 3) = 270 + 300 = 570 miles.\n\nI hope it is correct: 570 miles",
        "ground_truth": "The driver travels (3 hours * 30 mph) + (25 mph * 4 hours) = <<(3*30)+(25*4)=190>>190 miles per day\nFrom Monday to Saturday he travels in total 190 miles/day * 6 days = <<190*6=1140>>1,140 miles in a week\n#### 1140"
