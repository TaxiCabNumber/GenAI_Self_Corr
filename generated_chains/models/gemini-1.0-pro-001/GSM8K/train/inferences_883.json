At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFor a project, a builder purchased 7 boxes of bolts with each box containing 11 bolts.  He purchased 3 boxes of nuts with each box containing 15 nuts. He ended up finishing the project 6 days early and with 3 bolts and 6 nuts left over. How many bolts and nuts did he use for the project?",

So, x = 77 - 3 = 74\n6. The number of nuts left over is 6\n7. Let y be the number of nuts used\n8. So, y = 45 - 6 = 39\n9. Hence, the number of bolts and nuts used for the project is 74 and 39 respectively.\nI hope it is correct: 74, 39",
