At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLoraine makes wax sculptures of animals. Large animals take four sticks of wax and small animals take two sticks. She made three times as many small animals as large animals, and she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. How many sticks of wax did Loraine use to make all the animals?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let's assume Loraine made 'x' large animals.\n\n**Step 2:** Since she made three times as many small animals as large animals, she made 3 * x small animals.\n\n**Step 3:** We know that large animals take 4 sticks of wax, so Loraine used 4 * x sticks for large animals.\n\n**Step 4:** Similarly, small animals take 2 sticks of wax each, so she used 2 * (3 * x) = 6 * x sticks for small animals.\n\n**Step 5:** We are given that she used 12 sticks of wax for small animals, so 6 * x = 12.\n\n**Step 6:** Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means she made 2 large animals.\n\n**Step 7:** She made 3 * x = 3 * 2 = 6 small animals.\n\n**Step 8:** To find the total number of sticks of wax used, we add the wax used for large animals and small animals: (4 * x) + (6 * x) = (4 * 2) + (6 * 2) = 8 + 12 = 20.\n\nI hope it is correct: $20$",
