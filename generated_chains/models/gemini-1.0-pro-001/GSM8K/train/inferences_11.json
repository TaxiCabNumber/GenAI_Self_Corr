At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?",
        "inference": "1. Start with the initial amount of money Tobias has saved: $0\n2. Add the $5 allowance he gets each month for three months: $0 + $5 x 3 = $15\n3. Add the money he earned from mowing 4 lawns: $15 + $15 x 4 = $75\n4. Add the money he earned from shoveling driveways: $75 + $7 x d = amount earned from shoveling, where d is the number of driveways he shoveled\n5. Subtract the cost of the shoes to find the amount of change he has left: (amount earned from shoveling) - $95 = $15\n6. Solve for d: (amount earned from shoveling) - $95 = $15\n--> $7 x d = $95 - $15 = $80\n--> d = $80/$7 = 11.43\nI hope it is correct: He shoveled 11 driveways.",
        "ground_truth": "He saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110\nHe saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15\nHe earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = <<4*15=60>>60\nHe earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = <<110-60-15=35>>35\nHe shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5"
