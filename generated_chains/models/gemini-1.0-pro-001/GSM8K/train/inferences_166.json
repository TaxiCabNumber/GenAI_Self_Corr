        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrandpa Lou enjoys watching movies on the Hallmark channel, where every movie lasts 90 minutes.  If, on Tuesday, he watched several full-length movies on the Hallmark channel for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes, and then on Wednesday he watched on the same channel twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday.  What is the maximum number of full-length movies Grandpa could have watched during these two days?",
        "inference": "- Grandpa Lou watched films for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes on Tuesday. Since each movie lasts 90 minutes, convert 4 hours and 30 minutes to minutes: (4 x 60) + 30 = 270. Divide this number of minutes by 90 to get the number of movies: 270 / 90 = 3.\n- Grandpa Lou watched twice as many movies on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday. Therefore, multiply the number of movies he watched on Tuesday by 2 to get the number of movies he watched on Wednesday: 3 x 2 = 6.\n- Calculate the total number of movies Grandpa Lou watched over the two days by adding the number of movies on Tuesday and Wednesday: 3 + 6 = 9.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 9**",
        "ground_truth": "4 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 4*60+30=<<4*60+30=270>>270 minutes.\nAt 90 minutes per movie, Grandpa could watch a total of 270/90=<<270/90=3>>3 entire movies in 4 hours and 30 minutes.\nOn Wednesday, he watched 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 movies.\nThus, during these two days, he could have watched as many as 3+6=<<3+6=9>>9 movies.\n#### 9"
