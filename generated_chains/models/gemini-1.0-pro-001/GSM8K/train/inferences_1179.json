One third of Rob's cards are doubles, and Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob. If Jess has 40 doubles baseball cards, how many baseball cards does Rob have?",

Jess has 5 times as many doubles as Rob, so the number of doubles Jess has is 5 * x/3 = 5x/3.\n4. We know that Jess has 40 doubles, so 5x/3 = 40.\n5.
