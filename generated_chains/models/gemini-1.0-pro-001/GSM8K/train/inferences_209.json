At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFive coaster vans are used to transport students for their field trip. Each van carries 28 students, 60 of which are boys. How many are girls?",
        "inference": "1. We know that each van carries 28 students and that there are 5 vans. So, the total number of students is 28 * 5 = 140 students.\n2. We also know that 60 of the students are boys. So, the number of girls is 140 - 60 = 80 girls.\n\nI hope it is correct: 80 girls",
