At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA small poultry farm has 300 chickens, 200 turkeys and 80 guinea fowls. A strange, incurable disease hit the farm and every day the farmer lost 20 chickens, 8 turkeys and 5 guinea fowls. After a week, how many birds will be left in the poultry?",
        "inference": "1. **Calculate the number of chickens, turkeys, and guinea fowls lost after a week.**\nChickens lost: 20 chickens/day * 7 days = 140 chickens\nTurkeys lost: 8 turkeys/day * 7 days = 56 turkeys\nGuinea fowls lost: 5 guinea fowls/day * 7 days = 35 guinea fowls\n\n2. **Subtract the number of birds lost from the original number to find the number left.**\nChickens left: 300 chickens - 140 chickens = 160 chickens\nTurkeys left: 200 turkeys - 56 turkeys = 144 turkeys\nGuinea fowls left: 80 guinea fowls - 35 guinea fowls = 45 guinea fowls\n\n3. **Add the number of birds left to find the total number of birds in the poultry.**\nTotal birds left: 160 chickens + 144 turkeys + 45 guinea fowls = 349 birds\n\nI hope it is correct: 349 birds",
        "ground_truth": "There are 300+200+80 = <<300+200+80=580>>580 birds in total\nEvery day 20+8+5 = <<20+8+5=33>>33 birds are lost\nAfter a week which is 7 days, 33*7 = <<33*7=231>>231 birds would be lost\nThere would be 580-231 = <<580-231=349>>349 birds left in the poultry\n#### 349"
