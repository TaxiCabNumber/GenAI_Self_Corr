At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWickham is throwing a huge Christmas party. He invites 30 people. Everyone attends the party, and half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). He plans to serve a 3-course meal for the guests. If he uses a new plate for every course, how many plates does he need in total for his guests?",
        "inference": "1. He invites 30 people.\n2. Half of the guests bring a plus one (one other person). So, 30/2 = 15 people bring a plus one.\n3. Therefore, there will be a total of 30 + 15 = 45 guests at the party.\n4. Each guest will need 3 plates (one for each course).\n5. So, the total number of plates needed is 45 x 3 = 135.\n\nI hope it is correct: 135",
