At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBelinda can throw a ball at a speed of 20 feet/second. If the ball flies for 8 seconds before hitting the ground, and Belinda's border collie can run 5 feet/second, how many seconds will it take the border collie to catch up to the ball?",
        "inference": "1. The ball will travel 20 ft/s * 8 s = 160 ft before hitting the ground.\n\n\n2. The border collie will travel 5 ft/s * t, where t is the time in seconds it takes to catch up to the ball.\n\n\n3. To catch up to the ball, the border collie will need to travel 160 ft, so we can set up the equation 5 ft/s * t = 160 ft.\n\n\n4.  Divide both sides by 5 ft/s to get t = 32 s.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 32 s",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total distance the ball flies: 20 feet/second * 8 seconds = <<20*8=160>>160 feet\nThen divide that distance by the dog's speed to find how long it takes the dog to catch up to the ball: 160 feet / 5 feet/second = <<160/5=32>>32 seconds\n#### 32"
