At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn entrepreneur is crowdfunding a new business effort. He has three different dollar amount levels of financial backing options and each level is ten times as high as the previous one. He needs to raise $12000 to get his business off the ground. He succeeded after getting two backers at the highest level of financial backing, three at the second level, and ten at the lowest level. How many dollars was the highest level of financial backing?",
