At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRandy has some money in his piggy bank. He spends 2 dollars every time he goes to the store. He makes 4 trips to the store every month. If he had $104 dollars left in his piggy bank after a year, how much money, in dollars, did he have at first?",
