At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlice and Emily are selling oranges at the farmer's market. Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. In total, they sold 180 oranges. How many oranges did Alice sell?",
        "inference": "Let the number of oranges Emily sold be x.\nSo, the number of oranges Alice sold = 2x.\nTherefore, x + 2x = 180\n=> 3x = 180\n=> x = 60\nTherefore, the number of oranges Alice sold = 2x = 2 * 60 = 120.\nI hope it is correct: 120",
        "ground_truth": "Emily sold 180/3=<<180/3=60>>60 oranges.\nAlice sold 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 oranges.\n#### 120"
