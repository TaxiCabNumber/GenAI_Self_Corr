At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim is baking loaves of bread. He has 200g of flour in the cupboard, 100g of flour on the kitchen counter, and 100g in the pantry. If one loaf of bread requires 200g of flour, how many loaves can Jim bake?",

        "ground_truth": "Altogether, Jim has 200g + 100g + 100g = <<200+100+100=400>>400g of flour.\nHe can therefore bake 400g / 200g = <<400/200=2>>2 loaves of bread.\n#### 2"
