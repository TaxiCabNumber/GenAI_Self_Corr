At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLagoon island is populated by alligators. Half the alligators are male. The rest are female. Among the females, 40% are juveniles. There are 15 adult females. How many male alligators are there?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nLet's represent the total number of alligators on Lagoon Island as $x$.\n- Since half of the alligators are male, the number of male alligators is $x/2$.\n\n- The remaining alligators are female, which means there are $x/2$ female alligators.\n\n- Among the female alligators, 40% are juveniles, so the number of juvenile female alligators is $0.4 \\times (x/2) = 0.2x$\n\n- The remaining female alligators are adults, and the number of adult females is given as 15. So, we have:\n\n$Total \\ female \\ alligators = Juvenile \\ female \\ alligators + Adult \\ female \\ alligators$\n\n\n$$\\frac{x}{2} = 0.2x + 15$$\n\n- Solving for $x$, we get:\n\n\n$$x = 30$$\n\nTherefore, the number of male alligators is:\n\n\n$$Number \\ of \\ male \\ alligators = \\frac{x}{2}=\\frac{30}{2}=15$$\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
        "ground_truth": "60% of female alligators are adults because 100 - 40 = <<100-40=60>>60\nThere are 25 female alligators because 15 / .6 = <<15/.6=25>>25\nThere are 50 alligators in total because 25 / .5 = <<25/.5=50>>50\nThere are 25 male alligators because 50 / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25\n#### 25"
