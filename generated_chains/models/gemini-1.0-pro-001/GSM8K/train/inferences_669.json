At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Let's start by finding the number of frisbees she has currently.\nSince she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, and she has 60 marbles, she has 60 / 2 = 30 frisbees currently.\n\n2. Now let's find the number of deck cards she has currently.\nSince she has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, she has 30 - 20 = 10 deck cards currently.\n\n3. Let's calculate the number of each item she will have after buying 2/5 times more.\n- Marbles: 60 + (2/5) * 60 = 60 + 24 = 84 marbles\n- Frisbees: 30 + (2/5) * 30 = 30 + 12 = 42 frisbees\n- Deck cards: 10 + (2/5) * 10 = 10 + 4 = 14 deck cards\n\n4.
