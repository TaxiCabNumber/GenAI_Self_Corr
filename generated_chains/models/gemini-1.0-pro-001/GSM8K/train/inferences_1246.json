At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA spaceship is traveling to another planet. The spaceship travels at a consistent speed its entire journey unless it is stopped for the crew\u2019s break. After launch, the spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. It then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. After this, the spaceship would take an hour\u2019s break after every 11 hours of traveling and maintained this routine until the end of its journey. If the entire journey took 3 days then how long, in hours, was the spaceship not moving?",
        "inference": "- The spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours. So, the spaceship was not moving for 3 hours.\n- The spaceship then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. So, the spaceship was not moving for 1 hour.\n- After this, the spaceship would take an hour\u2019s break after every 11 hours of traveling. So, the spaceship was not moving for 1 hour after every 11 hours of traveling.\n- The entire journey took 3 days, which is 72 hours.\n- The spaceship traveled for 10 hours then stopped for 3 hours, then traveled for another 10 hours then stopped for 1 hour. So, the spaceship traveled for a total of 24 hours.\n- After this, the spaceship would take an hour\u2019s break after every 11 hours of traveling. So, the spaceship traveled for 11 hours, then stopped for 1 hour, then traveled for 11 hours, then stopped for 1 hour, and so on.\n- The spaceship continued this routine until the end of its journey, which took 72 hours.\n- So, the spaceship traveled for a total of 24 hours and was not moving for 72 - 24 = 48 hours.\nI hope it is correct: 48",
        "ground_truth": "On the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 10 hours + 10 hours = <<10+10=20>>20 hours traveling.\nOn the first day, the spaceship spent a total of 3 hours + 1 hour = <<3+1=4>>4 hours not moving.\nThis is a total of 20 hours traveling + 4 hours not moving = <<20+4=24>>24 hours or 1 day.\nSo the rest of the journey took place over 3 days journey \u2013 1 first day = <<3-1=2>>2 days.\nThis is the same as 2 days * 24 hours = <<2*24=48>>48 hours.\nIn these 2 days, the spaceship\u2019s time is split into 11 hours traveling + 1 hour break = <<11+1=12>>12 hour blocks.\nSo in the last 2 days, the spaceship wasn't moving for a total of 48 hours / 12 hour blocks = <<48/12=4>>4 hours.\nAdding this to breaks from the first day shows that the spaceship was not moving for a total of 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 hours.\n#### 8"
