At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA candy store uses food colouring in various candies. Each lollipop uses 5ml of food colouring, and each hard candy also needs food colouring. In one day, the candy store makes 100 lollipops and 5 hard candies. They do not use food colouring in anything else. The store has used 600ml of food colouring by the end of the day. How much food colouring, in millilitres, does each hard candy need?",
