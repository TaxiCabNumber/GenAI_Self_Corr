Tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for children. If her mom, dad, grandma, and three little sisters come to the show, how much will the total be for their tickets?",

Now, let's calculate the cost of tickets for adults and children separately.\n\n- Cost of adult tickets: 3 adults * $12 per ticket = $36\n- Cost of children's tickets: 3 children * $10 per ticket = $30\n\n3. Finally, let's add the cost of adult tickets and children's tickets to find the total cost.\n\n- Total cost: $36 (adult tickets) + $30 (children's tickets) = $66\n\nI hope it is correct: $66$",
