At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA chocolate bar weighs 125 g. A shopkeeper has just received a 2 kilogram box of chocolate. How many bars does this represent?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 2 kilograms to grams:\n\n2 kilograms = 2000 grams\n\n2. Divide the total weight of the chocolate by the weight of one bar:\n\n2000 grams \u00f7 125 grams/bar = 16 bars\n\nI hope it is correct: 16 bars",
        "ground_truth": "We have 2 kg = 2 * 1000 = <<2*1000=2000>>2000 g\nSo, the number of bars of chocolate is 2000 / 125 = <<2000/125=16>>16\n#### 16"
