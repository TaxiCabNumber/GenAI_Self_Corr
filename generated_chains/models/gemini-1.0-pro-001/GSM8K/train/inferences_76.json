How many vegetables did the garden produce?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nThe garden produced 237 potatoes. It produced 60 fewer cucumbers, so it produced 237 - 60 = 177 cucumbers. It produced twice as many peppers as cucumbers, so it produced 2 * 177 = 354 peppers.\n\nTherefore, the garden produced 237 potatoes, 177 cucumbers, and 354 peppers.\n\nAdding up these numbers, we get 237 + 177 + 354 = 768.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nI hope it is correct: 768",
