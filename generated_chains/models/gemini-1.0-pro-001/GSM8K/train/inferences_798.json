She needs to have 6 appetizers per each of her 30 guests.  She\u2019s making 3 dozen deviled eggs, 2 dozen pigs in a blanket and 2 dozen kebabs.  How many more dozen appetizers does she need to make?",

Determine the number of appetizers Patsy will have made:\n- 3 dozen deviled eggs = 3 * 12 = 36 appetizers\n- 2 dozen pigs in a blanket = 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers\n- 2 dozen kebabs = 2 * 12 = 24 appetizers\nTotal appetizers made = 36 + 24 + 24 = 84 appetizers\n\n2. Calculate the number of dozen appetizers needed:\n- 84 appetizers / 12 appetizers per dozen = 7 dozen\n\n3.
