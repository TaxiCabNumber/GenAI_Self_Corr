He is with his friend, who orders chicken fried steak for $14.  His friend pays for half the bill and James pays the tip along with his half of the bill. They tip 20%.  How much did James pay?",

Add the tip amount to the total bill amount. \n$30 + $6 = $36\n\n4. Find half of the total bill amount.\n$36 / 2 = $18\n\n5.
