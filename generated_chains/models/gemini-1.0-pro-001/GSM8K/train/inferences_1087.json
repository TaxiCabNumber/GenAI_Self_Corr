On a certain day, she neatly arranges 100 books on the shelf. By lunchtime, a certain number of books had been borrowed. She added 40 more books to the same shelf. By evening, 30 more books had been borrowed. If the shelf had 60 books remaining by the evening, how many books had been borrowed by lunchtime?",
        "inference": "Hadley had 100 books initially. By lunchtime, x number of books had been borrowed. She then added 40 more books, bringing the total to 100 + 40 = 140 books. By evening, 30 more books had been borrowed, leaving 140 - 30 = 110 books on the shelf. Since there were 60 books remaining by the evening, 110 - 60 = 50 books had been borrowed in total. Therefore, x = 50 - 30 = 20 books had been borrowed by lunchtime.\nI hope it is correct: 20",
