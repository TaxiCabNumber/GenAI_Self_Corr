At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere were 18 students assigned in a minibus for a field trip. Eight of these students were boys. On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same since some of the girls were not able to join the trip. How many girls were not able to join the field trip?",

Now, we know that the number of girls and boys on the day of the field trip was the same. So, let's find the number of girls who actually joined the trip.\nGirls on field trip = 8 (since the number of boys and girls was the same)\n3. Finally, we can find the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip by subtracting the number of girls who actually joined the trip from the number of girls initially assigned to the minibus.\nGirls not able to join = Girls assigned - Girls on field trip = 10 - 8 = 2\nI hope it is correct: 2",
