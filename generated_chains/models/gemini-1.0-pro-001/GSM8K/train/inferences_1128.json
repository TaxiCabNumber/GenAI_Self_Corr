At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA certain kind of wild mushroom has either spots or gills, but never both. Gilled mushrooms are rare, with only one growing for every nine spotted mushrooms that grow. A fallen log had 30 mushrooms growing on its side. How many gilled mushrooms were on the fallen log\u2019s side?",
        "inference": "* For every 9 spotted mushrooms there is 1 gilled mushroom. So, if there are 30 spotted mushrooms on the log, there are 30/9 = 3 gilled mushrooms on the log. \nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "There is 1 gilled mushroom for every 1 + 9 = <<1+9=10>>10 mushrooms.\nThus, there were 30 / 10 = <<30/10=3>>3 gilled mushrooms on the fallen log\u2019s side.\n#### 3"
