At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartha needs 4 cups of berries and 2 cups of heavy cream to make 1 quart of ice cream.  She wants to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.  At the farmers market, the 2 cup packages of strawberries are $3.00 each and the 2 cup package of raspberries are $5.00 each.  The heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.  How much will it cost her to make 1 quart of each ice cream?",
        "inference": "I will break this down into two separate problems:\n\n**Strawberry ice cream.** She needs 4 cups of berries, so she will need 2 packages of strawberries. 2 packages x $3.00 per package = $6.00 for strawberries. She needs 2 cups of heavy cream, so she will need 1/2 of a container of heavy cream. 1/2 of a container x $4.00 per container = $2.00 for heavy cream. $6.00 + $2.00 = $8.00 for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream.\n\n**Raspberry ice cream.** She needs 4 cups of berries, so she will need 2 packages of raspberries. 2 packages x $5.00 per package = $10.00 for raspberries. She needs 2 cups of heavy cream, so she will need 1/2 of a container of heavy cream. 1/2 of a container x $4.00 per container = $2.00 for heavy cream. $10.00 + $2.00 = $12.00 for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.\n\n**Total cost.** $8.00 + $12.00 = $20.00.\nI hope it is correct: $20.00",

So 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 packages of strawberries\nThe strawberries cost $3.00 per package and she needs 2 so 3*2=$<<3*2=6.00>>6.00\nShe needs 4 cups of raspberries per quart of ice cream and the raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages.
