At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHayden has a tank with a small hole in the bottom. The tank starts with 40 gallons of water. It loses 2 gallons of water per hour. Hayden does not add any water for the first two hours. He adds 1 gallon of water to the tank in hour three. He adds three gallons of water to the tank in the fourth hour. How much water is left in the tank at the end of the fourth hour?",
