At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 8 loads of laundry that need to be washed. Each load of laundry takes around 45 minutes to complete in the wash cycle and 1 hour in the dry cycle. How long, in hours, will it take to complete the entire set of laundry?",
