At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJay & Gloria were hosting a 4th of July party at their house.  Jay invited 22 people and Gloria invited 36.  They wanted to buy small American flags for everyone.  The craft store was having a sale on small flags, 5 flags for $1.00.  If they wanted all of their guests to have a flag and they also wanted 1 flag each, how much would they spend at the craft store?",
