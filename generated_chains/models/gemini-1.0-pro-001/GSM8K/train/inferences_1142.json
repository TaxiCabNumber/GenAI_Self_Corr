Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May. How many shark sightings are there in Cape May?",
        "inference": "1. Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year.\n2. Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May.\n3. Let x be the number of shark sightings in Cape May.\n4. Three times the number of shark sightings in Cape May is 3x.\n5. Five more than three times the number of shark sightings in Cape May is 3x + 5.\n6. We know that Daytona Beach has 5 more than three times the number of shark sightings as Cape May, so 3x + 5 = 26.\n7. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 21.\n8. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 7.\n9. Therefore, there are 7 shark sightings in Cape May.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
