At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nErwan went on shopping. He purchased a pair of shoes at $200 but discounted 30%, and two shirts at $80 each. Upon checkout, the cashier said that there is an additional 5% discount. How much did he spend after all the discounts?",

Calculate the total price of the shirts\n$80 x 2 = $160\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the shoes and shirts before additional discount\n$140 + $160 = $300\n\n5. Calculate the additional discount \n$300 x 5% = $15\n\n6. Calculate the total cost after all the discounts\n$300 - $15 = $285\nI hope it is correct: $285",
