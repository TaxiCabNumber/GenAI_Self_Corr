At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?",
        "inference": "The first spacecraft took 30 minutes to travel 448 miles, so its speed was 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.\n\nThe second spacecraft took 60 minutes to travel 448 miles, so its speed was 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.\n\nThe difference in speed between the two spacecraft was 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour = 448 miles per hour.\n\nI hope it is correct: 448",
        "ground_truth": "The first spacecraft flew for 30 minutes, or 30/60=1/2 hour.\nThe second spacecraft flew for 30+30=<<30+30=60>>60 minutes, or 1 hour.\nThus the first spacecraft traveled at a speed of 448 miles in 1/2 hour, or 448/(1/2)=896 miles per hour.\nThe second spacecraft traveled 448 miles in 1 hour, or 448/1=<<448/1=448>>448 miles per hour.\nThe difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft was 896-448=<<896-448=448>>448 miles per hour.\n#### 448"
