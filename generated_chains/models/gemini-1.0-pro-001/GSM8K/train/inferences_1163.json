The first included 9 carnations, and the second included 14 carnations. If the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12, how many carnations were in the third bouquet?",

The first bouquet has 9 carnations, and the second bouquet has 14 carnations.  So, the number of carnations in the third bouquet is $$36 - 9 - 14 = 13$$ \nI hope it is correct: 13",
