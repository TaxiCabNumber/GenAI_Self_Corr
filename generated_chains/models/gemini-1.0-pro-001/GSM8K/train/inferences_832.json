At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn buys 1000 balloons.  Each balloon holds 10 liters of air.  If he buys 500-liter tanks of gas, how many tanks does he need to buy to fill all the balloons?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the number of balloons to the total volume of air needed:\n1000 balloons x 10 liters/balloon = 10,000 liters\n\n2. Convert the tank size to liters:\n500 liters/tank\n\n3. Divide the total volume of air needed by the tank size:\n10,000 liters / 500 liters/tank = 20 tanks\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 tanks",
        "ground_truth": "He needs 1000*10=<<1000*10=10000>>10000 liters of gas\nSo he needs 10000/500=<<10000/500=20>>20 tanks\n#### 20"
