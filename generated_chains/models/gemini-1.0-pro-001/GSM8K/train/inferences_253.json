At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA rectangular plot of private property is fenced in by a chain-link fence. The long sides of the plot are three times the length of the short sides. One short side of the fence is rusted from being hit by a sprinkler and needs to be replaced. If all the sides of the fence together are 640 feet long, how many feet of fence need to be replaced?",
        "inference": "Let x be the length of the short sides of the plot. Then the long sides of the \n\nplot are 3x feet long. The total length of the fence is:\n\nPerimeter = 2(length + width)\n\n= 2(3x + x)\n\n= 8x feet\n\nSince the total length of the fence is 640 feet, we have:\n\n8x = 640\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\nx = 80\n\nSo, the length of the short sides of the plot is 80 feet. Since one short side needs to be replaced, the length of the fence that needs to be replaced is:\n\n80 feet\n\nI hope it is correct: 80 feet",
        "ground_truth": "Let S be the length of the short side of the fence.\nThus, the length of a long side of the fence is 3S.\nThere are 2 of each side, so the whole fence is 2S + 2 * 3S = 2S + 6S = 8S long.\nThe whole fence is 8S = 640 feet long.\nThus, the short side of the fence that needs to be replaced is S = 640 / 8 = <<640/8=80>>80 feet long.\n#### 80"
