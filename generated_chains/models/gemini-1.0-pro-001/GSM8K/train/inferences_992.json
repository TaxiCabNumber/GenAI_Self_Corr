At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHannah is making banana bread. She needs to use 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. It takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush. If Hannah uses 20 bananas, how many cups of flour should she use?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find out how many cups of banana mush Hannah will have. To do this, we divide the number of bananas by 4.\n\n20 bananas / 4 = 5 cups of banana mush\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cups of flour Hannah should use. To do this, we multiply the number of cups of banana mush by 3.\n\n5 cups of banana mush * 3 = 15 cups of flour\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
        "ground_truth": "First find the number of cups of banana mush Hannah gets: 20 bananas / 4 bananas/cup = <<20/4=5>>5 cups\nThen multiply the number of cups of mush by the ratio of flour to mush to find the number of cups of flour: 5 cups mush * 3 cups flour/1 cup mush = <<5*3=15>>15 cups flour\n#### 15"
