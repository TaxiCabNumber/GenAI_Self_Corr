At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a section of the forest, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits. Three foxes invade this region and hunt the rodents. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week. How many rabbits and weasels will be left after 3 weeks?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Calculate the total number of weasels caught by the foxes in 3 weeks: 4 weasels/fox * 3 foxes * 3 weeks = 36 weasels\n\n2. Calculate the total number of rabbits caught by the foxes in 3 weeks: 2 rabbits/fox * 3 foxes * 3 weeks = 18 rabbits\n\n3. Subtract the number of weasels caught from the original population of weasels: 100 weasels - 36 weasels = 64 weasels\n\n4. Subtract the number of rabbits caught from the original population of rabbits: 50 rabbits - 18 rabbits = 32 rabbits\n\n**Final Answer:** I hope it is correct: 64 weasels and 32 rabbits",
