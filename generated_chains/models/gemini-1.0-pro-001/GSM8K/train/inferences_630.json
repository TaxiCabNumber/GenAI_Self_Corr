At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn her birthday, Avianna bought red candles and blue candles in the ratio of 5:3. If Avianna had 45 red candles on her birthday, how many blue candles did she have?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of candles.**\nThe ratio of red candles to blue candles is 5:3. This means that for every 5 red candles, there are 3 blue candles. So, if Avianna had 45 red candles, the total number of candles is 45 + 3 x 45/5 = 45 + 27 = 72.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of blue candles.**\nTo find the number of blue candles, we need to multiply the total number of candles by the ratio of blue candles to total candles. The ratio of blue candles to total candles is 3/8, so the number of blue candles is 72 x 3/8 = 27.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 27**",
        "ground_truth": "If the ratio of red candles to blue candles Avianna bought was 5:3, then the total ratio was 5+3 = 8.\nIf 5 represented 45 candles in the total ratio, then 8, the actual ratio, represents 8*45 = 360 divided by 5 is 360/5 = 72 candles.\nIf the total number of candles was 72, then the number of blue candles is 72 candles - 45 candles = <<72-45=27>>27 candles\n#### 27"
