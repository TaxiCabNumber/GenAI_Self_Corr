She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. She works part-time 20 hours per week. How many hours left over does Madeline have?",
        "inference": "1. Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class.\n2. She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. In a week, she spends 4 x 7 = 28 hours on homework.\n3. She also spends 8 hours per day sleeping, which is, 8 x 7 = 56 hours per week.\n4. She works part-time 20 hours per week.\n5. So, the total number of hours she spends on these activities = 18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = 122 hours.\n6. Since there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours x 7 days), she has 168 - 122 = 46 hours left over.\n\nI hope it is correct: 46",
        "ground_truth": "Madeline spends 4*7=<<4*7=28>>28 hours on homework.\nShe spends 8*7-56 hours sleeping.\nTherefore, she is busy 28+18+56+20=<<28+18+56+20=122>>122 hours per week.\nThere are 7*24=<<7*24=168>>168 hours per week.\nThus, Madeline has 168-122=<<168-122=46>>46 hours left over.\n#### 46"
