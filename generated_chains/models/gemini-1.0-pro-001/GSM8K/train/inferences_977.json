At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTommy goes for a run around his neighborhood and decides to calculate how many wheels he saw. All the trucks in his neighborhood have 4 wheels and all the cars in his neighborhood also have 4 wheels. If he saw 12 trucks and 13 cars, how many wheels did he see?",
