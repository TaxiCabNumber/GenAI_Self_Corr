At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaria wants to buy a brand new bike. The retail price at the bike shop stands at $600. She saved $120 toward the purchase. As this was not enough, she asked her mother to give her the remaining amount. Her mother offered her $250 and told her that she needs to earn the rest working during the holidays. How much money must Maria earn to be able to buy the bike she wants?",

Determine the amount of money Maria still needs to buy the bike:\nBike retail price = $600\nAmount saved by Maria = $120\nAmount given by her mother = $250\nAmount still needed = $600 - $120 - $250 = $230\n\n2. Therefore, Maria needs to earn $230 to be able to buy the bike she wants.\n\nI hope it is correct: 230",
        "ground_truth": "Maria has $120 and received $250 from her mother. So she has 120 + 250 = $<<120+250=370>>370.\nAs the price of the bike stands at $600, Maria needs 600 \u2013 370 = $<<600-370=230>>230 more to buy the bike.\n#### 230"
