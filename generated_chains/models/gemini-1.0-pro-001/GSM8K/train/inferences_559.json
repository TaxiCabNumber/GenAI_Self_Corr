At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLuna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget while her phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget. If the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, how much is Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses?",
        "inference": "1- Let's represent Luna's house rental budget with variable 'hr'.\nGiven that Luna's monthly food budget is equal to 60% of her house rental budget, we can represent her food budget with the expression 0.6*hr.\n\n2- We also know that Luna's phone bill budget is 10% of her food budget, which can be represented as 0.1*(0.6*hr) = 0.06*hr.\n\n3- It is given that the total budget of house rental and food budget is $240, so we can write:\n hr + 0.6*hr = 240 \n Simplifying, we get:\n1.6*hr = 240\n\n4- Solving for 'hr' (house rental budget):\n hr = 240/1.6 = 150 \n\n5- Now that we have the house rental budget (hr) as $150, we can calculate Luna's food budget:\n0.6*hr = 0.6*150 = $90\n\n6- And her phone bill budget:\n0.06*hr = 0.06*150 = $9\n\n7- Finally, Luna's total monthly budget to pay all those expenses would be:\nTotal Budget = House Rental Budget + Food Budget + Phone Bill Budget\nTotal Budget = $150 + $90 + $9\nTotal Budget = $249\n\nI hope it is correct: $249$",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be Luna's house rental budget.\nThe total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.\nThe equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.\nThus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.\nSo, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.\nHer phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.\nTherefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $<<240+9=249>>249.\n#### 249"
