At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUtopia National Park hosted 30,000 elephants on Friday night. The next morning, there was a 4-hour elephant exodus out of the park, at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants/hour. Over the next 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate. If the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, at what rate did the new elephants enter the park?",
        "inference": "- There were 30,000 elephants in the park at the start.\n- 2,880 elephants left the park each hour over 4 hours, so a total of 11,520 elephants left the park.\n- The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980, so 28,980 + 11,520 = 40,500 elephants entered the park.\n- The new elephants entered the park over 7 hours, so the rate at which they entered the park was 40,500 / 7 = 5,785.71 elephants/hour.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5,785.71",
