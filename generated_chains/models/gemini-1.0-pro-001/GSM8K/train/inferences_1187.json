What's the maximum number of apples Brian can buy if he left his house with only $50 and needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way?",

He has $50 - $15 = $35 left to spend on apples.\n\n3. Since a bag of dozen apples costs $14, he can buy a maximum of $35 / $14 = 2 bags and 5 apples.\n\n4. However, he also needs to pay the $3.50 subway fare each way, so he has $35 - 2 * $3.50 = $28 left to spend on apples.\n\n5.
