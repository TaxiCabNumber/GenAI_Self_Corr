At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUnique is making biscuits. She has a sheet of dough that is 12 inches by 12 inches. She makes square biscuits and each biscuit is 3 inches by 3 inches. How many biscuits can she make with this dough?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the area of the sheet of dough:\n* Area = length x width\n* Area = 12 inches x 12 inches\n* Area = 144 square inches\n\n2. Calculate the area of each biscuit:\n* Area = length x width\n* Area = 3 inches x 3 inches\n* Area = 9 square inches\n\n3. Divide the area of the dough by the area of each biscuit to determine the number of biscuits that can be made:\n* Number of biscuits = Area of dough / Area of each biscuit\n* Number of biscuits = 144 square inches / 9 square inches\n* Number of biscuits = 16\n\nI hope it is correct: 16",
        "ground_truth": "She has 144 square inches of dough because 12 times 12 equals <<12*12=144>>144.\nEach biscuit uses 9 square inches of dough because 3 times 3 equals 9.\nShe can make 16 biscuits because 144 divided by 9 equals <<144/9=16>>16.\n#### 16"
