Two children whose average weight is 64 pounds also went inside.

Add the total weight of the adults and the children: 420 + 128 = 548 pounds.\n\n4. Subtract the total weight of the adults and children from the maximum weight: 600 - 548 = 52 pounds.\n\n5. The maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded is 52 pounds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 52",
