He ran at 10 miles per hour for half an hour, 20 miles per hour for half an hour, then ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes. How many miles has Kevin run?",

Kevin then ran at 20 miles per hour for half an hour, so he traveled 20 * 0.5 = 10 miles.\n3. Finally, Kevin ran at 8 miles per hour for 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours, so he traveled 8 * 0.25 = 2 miles.\n4. In total, Kevin traveled 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 miles.\nI hope it is correct: 17 $miles$",
        "ground_truth": "At his first speed, Kevin ran 10 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<10*0.5=5>>5 miles.\nAt his second speed, he ran 20 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = <<20*0.5=10>>10 miles.\n15 minutes is a quarter of an hour so at his third speed, he ran 8 miles per hour * 0.25 hours = <<8*0.25=2>>2 miles.\nTherefore, Kevin ran a total of 5 miles + 10 miles + 2 miles = <<5+10+2=17>>17 miles.\n#### 17"
