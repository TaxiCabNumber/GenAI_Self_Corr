At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCori is 3 years old today.  In 5 years, she will be one-third the age of her aunt.  How old is her aunt today?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let's represent the age of Cori's aunt today as \"x.\"  \n**Step 2:** In 5 years, Cori will be 3 + 5 = 8 years old.  \n**Step 3:** According to the given information, in 5 years, Cori's age will be one-third of her aunt's age. So, we can write the equation: 8 = x/3.  \n**Step 4:** To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 3: 8*3 = x/3*3, which gives us x = 24.  \n**Step 5:** Therefore, Cori's aunt is 24 years old today.  \nI hope it is correct: 24",
        "ground_truth": "In 5 years, Cori will be 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 years old.\nIn 5 years, Cori\u2019s aunt will be 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 years old.\nToday, her aunt is 24 - 5 = <<24-5=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19"
