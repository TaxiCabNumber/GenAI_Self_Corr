At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively.

Therefore, the total ratio is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 parts.\n\n**Step 3:** To find the total sum of money, divide Amy's share by her ratio part: $50 \u00f7 1 = $300\n\n**Step 4:** To find Sandra's share, multiply the total sum by Sandra's ratio part: $300 \u00d7 2/6 = $100\n\n**I hope it is correct: $100$**",
