        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony's dad is very strict about the washing machine and family members are only allowed to wash 50 total ounces of clothing at a time. Tony doesn't want to break the rules, so he weighs his clothes and finds that a pair of socks weighs 2 ounces, underwear weighs 4 ounces, a shirt weighs 5 ounces, shorts weigh 8 ounces, and pants weigh 10 ounces. Tony is washing a pair of pants, 2 shirts, a pair of shorts, and 3 pairs of socks. How many more pairs of underwear can he add to the wash and not break the rule?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total weight of the clothes Tony is washing:\n2 pants x 10 ounces = 20 ounces\n2 shirts x 5 ounces = 10 ounces\n1 pair of shorts x 8 ounces = 8 ounces\n3 pairs of socks x 2 ounces = 6 ounces\nTotal weight = 20 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 44 ounces\n\n2. Subtract the total weight of the clothes Tony is washing from the maximum weight allowed:\n50 ounces (maximum weight) - 44 ounces (weight of Tony's clothes) = 6 ounces\n\n3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of a pair of underwear:\n6 ounces / 4 ounces per pair of underwear = 1.5 pairs of underwear\n\n4. Tony can add 1 pair of underwear to the wash without breaking the rule.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1 pair of underwear",
        "ground_truth": "He is washing 10 ounces of shirts because 2 x 5 = <<2*5=10>>10\nHe is washing 6 ounces of socks because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6\nHe is already washing 34 ounces of clothes because 10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = <<10+10+8+6=34>>34\nHe can wash 16 more ounces because 50 - 34 = <<50-34=16>>16\nHe can wash 4 pairs of underwear because 16 / 4 = <<16/4=4>>4\n#### 4"
