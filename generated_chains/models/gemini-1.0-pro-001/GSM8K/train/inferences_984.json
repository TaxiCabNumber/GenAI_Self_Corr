If Legoland has 180 kangaroos, how many koalas and kangaroos are there altogether?",
        "inference": "1. Let the number of koalas be x.\n2. Since there are 5 kangaroos for each koala, the number of kangaroos is 5x.\n3. We are given that the number of kangaroos is 180, so 5x = 180.\n4. Solving for x, we get x = 36.\n5. Therefore, there are 36 koalas and 5 * 36 = 180 kangaroos.\n6. The total number of koalas and kangaroos is 36 + 180 = 216.\nI hope it is correct: 216",
