At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTimothy has $50 to spend at a souvenir shop. He sees some t-shirts that cost $8 each, key chains that sell 3 pieces for $2, and bags that cost $10 each. Timothy buys 2 t-shirts and 2 bags. How many pieces of key chains can he buy with the amount of money he has left?",

        "ground_truth": "The two t-shirts amount to $8 x 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.\nThe two bags amount to $10 x 2= $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo Timothy spent $16 + $20 = $<<16+20=36>>36 for the shirts and bags.\nHe still has $50 - $36 = $<<50-36=14>>14 left to spend for the key chains.\nWith the money, he can buy $14/$2 = <<14/2=7>>7 sets of key chains.\nTherefore, he can buy 7 x 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 pieces of key chains.\n#### 21"
