At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLaura is hosting a carwash. She will charge $5 for a car, $6 for a truck, and $7 for an SUV. They raised $100 in total. If they washed 5 SUVs and 5 trucks, how many cars did they wash?",
        "inference": "1. Let the number of cars washed be x.\n2. The total amount raised from washing cars is 5x.\n3. The amount raised from washing trucks is 6 x 5 = 30.\n4. The amount raised from washing SUVs is 7 x 5 = 35.\n5. The total amount raised is 100, so we have the equation 5x + 30 + 35 = 100.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get 5x + 65 = 100.\n7. Subtracting 65 from both sides, we get 5x = 35.\n8. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 7.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
        "ground_truth": "They earned $30 from trucks because 5 x 6 = <<5*6=30>>30\nThey earned $35 from SUVs because 5 x 7 = <<5*7=35>>35\nThey earned $35 from cars because 100 - 35 - 30 = <<100-35-30=35>>35\nThey washed 7 cars because 35 / 5 = <<35/5=7>>7\n#### 7"
