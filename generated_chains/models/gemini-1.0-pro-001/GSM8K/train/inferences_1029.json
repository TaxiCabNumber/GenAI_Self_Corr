Bess, the smallest cow, gives him two pails of milk every day. Brownie, the largest cow, produces three times that amount. Then Daisy makes one pail more than Bess. How many pails of milk does Farmer Red get from them each week?",
        "inference": "1. Bess gives 2 pails of milk per day, so she gives 14 pails (2 * 7) per week.\n\n2. Brownie gives 3 times as much milk as Bess, so she gives 21 pails (3 * 7) per week.\n\n3. Daisy gives one pail more than Bess, so she gives 15 pails (2 + 7) per week.\n\n4. To find the total number of pails of milk Farmer Red gets from them each week, we add the amounts from Bess, Brownie, and Daisy: 14 + 21 + 15 = 50 pails.\nI hope it is correct: 50",
