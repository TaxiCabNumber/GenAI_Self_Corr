At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcos has to get across a 5 mile lake in his speedboat in 10 minutes so he can make it to work on time. How fast does he need to go in miles per hour to make it?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the distance to miles: 5 miles\n2. Convert the time to hours: 10 minutes = 10/60 = 1/6 hours\n3. Calculate the speed: Speed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = 5 miles / (1/6) hours\nSpeed = 5 miles * 6 hours/mile\nI hope it is correct: 30 miles per hour",
        "ground_truth": "10 minutes for 5 miles means 10 minutes / 5 miles = <<10/5=2>>2 minutes/mile\n1 hour is 60 minutes so 60 minutes/hour / 2 minutes/mile = 30 miles/hour\n#### 30"
