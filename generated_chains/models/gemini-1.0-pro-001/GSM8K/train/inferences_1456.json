How many fishes were they able to catch throughout the competition if they are on the same team?",

Jonah was able to reel 4 fishes per day, so in the 5 days he was able to catch 4 x 5 = 20\n3. George was able to reel 8 fishes per day, so in the 5 days he was able to catch 8 x 5 = 40 \n4. The team was able to catch a total of 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 fishes throughout the competition.\nI hope it is correct: 90",
