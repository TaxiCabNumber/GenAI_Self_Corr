At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe gummy bear factory manufactures 300 gummy bears a minute. Each packet of gummy bears has 50 gummy bears inside. How long would it take for the factory to manufacture enough gummy bears to fill 240 packets, in minutes?",
        "inference": "1) First we find the number of the gummy bears that go inside 240 packets:\n 240 x 50 = 12000 gummy bears.\n2) To find the number of minutes it takes to make 12000 gummy bears, we divide the total number of gummy bears by the number of gummy bears manufactured per minute: \n12000/300 = 40 minutes needed.\n\nI hope it is correct: 40 $minutes$",
