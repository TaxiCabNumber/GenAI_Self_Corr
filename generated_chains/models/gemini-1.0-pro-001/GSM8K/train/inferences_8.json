At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?",
        "inference": "1. Add up the amount Alexis spent on the other items: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143\n2. Subtract this total from Alexis's budget of $200: $200 - $143 = $57\n3. This is the amount Alexis spent on the shoes.\nI hope it is correct: $57$",
        "ground_truth": "Let S be the amount Alexis paid for the shoes.\nShe spent S + 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18 = S + <<+30+46+38+11+18=143>>143.\nShe used all but $16 of her budget, so S + 143 = 200 - 16 = 184.\nThus, Alexis paid S = 184 - 143 = $<<184-143=41>>41 for the shoes.\n#### 41"
