At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot. He had to walk through every row in Section G and Section H to find it. Section G has 15 rows that each hold 10 cars. Section H has 20 rows that each hold 9 cars. If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?",

First, we need to find the total number of cars in Section G and Section H.\n- Section G: 15 rows x 10 cars/row = 150 cars\n- Section H: 20 rows x 9 cars/row = 180 cars\n- Total: 150 cars + 180 cars = 330 cars\n\n2. Next, we need to find how long it takes to walk past 330 cars at 11 cars per minute.\n- 330 cars / 11 cars/minute = 30 minutes\nI hope it is correct: 30 minutes",
