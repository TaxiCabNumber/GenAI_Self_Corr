Anne's dad uses 3 grams at each brushing, her mom uses 2 grams, Anne and her brother use 1 gram each. Each member of the family brushes their teeth three times a day. How many days will it take for the toothpaste to run out?",

Calculate the total number of days the toothpaste will last:\n105 grams (toothpaste) / 7 grams per day = 15 days\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
