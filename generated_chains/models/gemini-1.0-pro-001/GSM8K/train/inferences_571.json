At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAnthony and his friend Leonel read about the importance of keeping pets at home and decided to start adopting cats and dogs from the local rescue center. Anthony has 12 cats and dogs, 2/3 of which are cats. Leonel has half times as many cats as Anthony and seven more dogs than Anthony. How many animals in total do the two have?",
        "inference": "1. Anthony has a total of 12 cats and dogs, and 2/3 of them are cats, so the number of cats Anthony has is 12 x 2/3 = 8 cats.\n2. Therefore, the number of dogs Anthony has is 12 - 8 = 4 dogs.\n3. Leonel has half the number of cats as Anthony, so he has 8 / 2 = 4 cats.\n4. Leonel has seven more dogs than Anthony, so he has 4 + 7 = 11 dogs.\n5. Therefore, the total number of animals Anthony and Leonel have is 8 + 4 + 4 + 11 = 27 animals.\n\nI hope it is correct: 27",
