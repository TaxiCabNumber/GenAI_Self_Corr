At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPhil has a coin collection he likes to add to.  He started with 50 state quarters his parents gave him.  Over the next year he doubled this.  The following year he collected 3 each month.  The year after that he collected 1 every third month.  The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection.  How many did he have left after losing some?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nPhil started with 50 state quarters.\n- He doubled this the following year, so he had 50 x 2 = 100 quarters.\n- The year after that he collected 3 each month. There are 12 months in a year, so he collected 3 x 12 = 36 quarters.\n- The year after that he collected 1 every third month. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he collected 1 x 4 = 4 quarters.\n- The year after that he lost a quarter of them when he misplaced his collection. So he lost 100 / 4 = 25 quarters.\n\n**Therefore, he had 100 + 36 + 4 - 25 = 115 quarters left after losing some.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 115",
