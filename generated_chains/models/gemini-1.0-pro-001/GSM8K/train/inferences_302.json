At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarrie is wrapping three birthday presents. One present needs two square feet of wrapping paper to cover. The second present needs three-quarters of that amount. The third present needs the same amount as both other presents put together. How many square feet of wrapping paper does Carrie need for all three presents?",
        "inference": "1. The second present needs three-quarters of 2 square feet, which is 2 * 3 / 4 = 1.5 square feet.\n2. The third present needs the same amount as both other presents put together, which is 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 square feet.\n3. So, the total amount of wrapping paper Carrie needs is 2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7 square feet.\nI hope it is correct: 7 square feet",
        "ground_truth": "The second present needs 3 / 4 * 2 = 1 1/2 square feet of wrapping paper.\nThe third present needs 2 + 1 1/2 = 3 1/2 square feet of wrapping paper.\nTherefore, Carrie needs 2 + 1 1/2 + 3 1/2 = 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.\n#### 7"
