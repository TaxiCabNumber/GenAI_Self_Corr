At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAustin is a surfer. He took a trip to the beach during surfing season and the highest wave he caught was two feet higher than four times his height. The shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height. The shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard is long. How tall was the highest wave Austin caught?",
        "inference": "Let x be Austin's height.\nThe highest wave he caught was 2 feet higher than four times his height, so the height of the highest wave is 4x + 2.\nThe shortest wave he caught was four feet higher than his height, so the height of the shortest wave is x + 4.\nThe shortest wave was three feet higher than his 7-foot surfboard is long, so the length of his surfboard is x + 4 - 3 = x + 1.\nSince the length of his surfboard is 7 feet, we have x + 1 = 7, so x = 6.\nTherefore, the height of the highest wave is 4x + 2 = 4(6) + 2 = 26 feet.\nI hope it is correct: 26",
        "ground_truth": "The shortest wave was 7 + 3 = <<7+3=10>>10 feet tall.\nAustin is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 feet tall.\nThus, the highest wave Austin caught was 6 * 4 + 2 = 24 + 2 = <<6*4+2=26>>26 feet tall.\n#### 26"
