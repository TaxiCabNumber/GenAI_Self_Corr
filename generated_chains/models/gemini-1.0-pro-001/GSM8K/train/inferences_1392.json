At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCody was reading through his favorite book series.  The series was 54 books in total.  If Cody read 6 books the first week, and 3 books the second week and then 9 books every week after that.  How many weeks did it take Cody to read his series?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of remaining books after the second week.\nWe know that Cody read a total of 6 books the first week, and 3 books the second week, so we can start with the equation x = 54 - 6 - 3 = 45.\nWe also know that Cody read 9 books every week after the second week, so the number of remaining books after each week decreases by 9.\nLet n be the number of weeks after the second week. We can set up the equation x - 9n = 0, where x represents the number of remaining books after the second week and n represents the number of weeks.\nSolving for n, we get n = x / 9 = 45 / 9 = 5.\nTherefore, it took Cody 5 weeks after the second week, or a total of 5 + 2 = 7 weeks, to read the entire series.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
        "ground_truth": "Cody needs to read 54 books - 6 books - 3 books = <<54-6-3=45>>45 books.\nCody read 9 books each week after = 45 books / 9 books per week = <<45/9=5>>5 weeks.\nCody read for 1 week + 1 week + 5 weeks = <<1+1+5=7>>7 weeks total.\n#### 7"
