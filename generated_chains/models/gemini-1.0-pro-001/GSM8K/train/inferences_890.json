At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJavier is an Olympic javelin thrower.  In the last Olympics, he threw the javelin three times.  The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw.  If the sum of all three throws was 1050 meters, then how far, in meters, did he throw the javelin on his first throw?",
        "inference": "Let x be the distance of the second throw.\nThe first throw was 2x meters.\nThe third throw was 4x meters.\nThe sum of all three throws is 1050 meters.\n2x + x + 4x = 1050\n7x = 1050\nx = 150\nTherefore, the first throw was 2x = 2*150 = 300 meters.\nI hope it is correct: 300",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the distance he threw the javelin on the first throw.\nThus, the sum of his three throws is x+0.5x+2x=1050 meters.\nThus, 3.5x=1050.\nAnd we find the distance he threw the javelin on the first throw is x=<<300=300>>300 meters.\n#### 300"
