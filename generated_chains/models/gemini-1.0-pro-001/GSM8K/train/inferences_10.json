At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?",
        "inference": "We know that the amount of people in each ship doubles over time. So, let's represent the number of people on the first ship as \"x\".\nIn the second hundred years, the ship will have 2x people, and in the third hundred years, the ship will have 4x people.\nWe know that the monster has consumed a total of 847 people over three hundred years. So, we can write an equation:\nx + 2x + 4x = 847\n7x = 847\nx = 847/7\nx = 121\nTherefore, the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years was 121.\nI hope it is correct: 121",
        "ground_truth": "Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years\u2019 ship.\nThe second hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.\nThe third hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = <<2*2=4>>4S people.\nAll the ships had S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847 people.\nThus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121 people on it.\n#### 121"
