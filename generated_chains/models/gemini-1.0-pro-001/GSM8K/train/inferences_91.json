At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn works a job that offers performance bonuses.  He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours.  He has the option of working hard to earn the performance bonus of an extra $20 a day, but the extra effort results in a 2-hour longer workday.  How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?",

        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=100>>100 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 100/10= <<100/10=10>>10 dollars an hour.\n#### 10"
