At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNico borrows 3 books from the library on Monday.  On Monday, he reads the first book with a total of 20 pages.  On Tuesday, he reads the second book with a total of 12 pages.  On Wednesday, he reads the third book.  If he has read a total of 51 pages from Monday to Wednesday, how many pages did he read on Wednesday?",
