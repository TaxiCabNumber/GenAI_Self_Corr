At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, and 4 more cows than goats.  If the farmer has 56 animals total, how many goats does he have?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of goats with x.  Since the farmer has 4 more cows than goats, the number of cows is x + 4.  The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows, so the number of pigs is 2(x + 4) = 2x + 8.  The total number of animals is 56, so we can set up the equation:  x + (x + 4) + (2x + 8) = 56.  Simplifying and solving for x:  x + x + 4 + 2x + 8 = 56  4x + 12 = 56  4x = 44  x = 11.  Therefore, the farmer has 11 goats.  I hope it is correct: 11",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of goats\nCows:4+x\nPigs:2(4+x)=8+2x\nTotal:x+4+x+8+2x=56\n4x+12=56\n4x=44\nx=<<11=11>>11 goats\n#### 11"
