At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJanice adds 2 tablespoons of koolaid power and 16 tablespoons of water to a jug. She leaves it out long enough for 4 tablespoons of water to evaporate. Then she quadruples the amount of water in the jug. What percentage of the liquid in the jug is koolaid powder?",

Amount of water left after evaporation = 16 - 4 = 12 tablespoons\n5. New amount of water added = 4 x 12 = 48 tablespoons\n6. Total amount of liquid in the jug = 2 + 12 + 48 = 62 tablespoons\n7. Percentage of the liquid in the jug that is koolaid powder = (2/62) x 100 = 3.22%\nI hope it is correct: 3.22%",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many tablespoons of water are left after the evaporation: 16 tbs - 4 tbs = <<16-4=12>>12 tbs\nThen multiply this number by 4 to find how much water is in the jug after Janice refills it: 12 tbs * 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 tbs\nNow add the 2 tablespoons of koolaid powder to find the total volume of the liquid in the jug: 48 tbs + 2 tbs = <<48+2=50>>50 tbs\nNow divide the volume of the koolaid powder by the total volume and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of the liquid that's koolaid: 2 tbs / 50 tbs * 100% = 4%\n#### 4"
