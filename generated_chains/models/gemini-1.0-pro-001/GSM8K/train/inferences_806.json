At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA porcelain vase was originally priced at $200 but went on sale for 25% off. If Donna bought the porcelain vase and paid 10% sales tax, how much did she pay in total?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- Porcelain vase pre-discount price: $200\n- Discount rate: 25% of $200 = $200 x 0.25 = $50\n- Porcelain vase post-discount price: $200 - $50 = $150\n- Sales tax rate: 10% of $150 = $150 x 0.10 = $15\n- Total Donna paid: $150 + $15 = $165\nI hope it is correct: $answer$165",
        "ground_truth": "Donna got $200 x 25/100 = $<<200*25/100=50>>50 less for the porcelain vase.\nSo, the porcelain vase is now $200 - $50 = $<<200-50=150>>150.\nDonna has to pay $150 x 10/100 = $<<150*10/100=15>>15 for the sales tax.\nTherefore, she paid $150 + $15 = $<<150+15=165>>165 in total.\n#### 165"
