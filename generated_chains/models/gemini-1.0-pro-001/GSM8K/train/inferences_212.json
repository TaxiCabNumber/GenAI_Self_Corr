        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRandy just turned 12 and started playing the piano. His friend Sheila told him about the 10,000-hour rule which says, after 10,000 hours of practice, you become an expert or master in your field. If Randy wants to become a piano expert before he is 20, how many hours a day will he need to practice if he practices every day, Monday \u2013 Friday, and takes two weeks off for vacation each year?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the total number of hours Randy can practice per year.\n\n* He will practice every weekday (5 days per week) for 48 weeks (52 weeks - 2 weeks of vacation).\n* Hours per year = 5 days/week * 48 weeks/year * x hours/day (where x is the unknown number of hours he needs to practice each day).\n* Hours per year = 240x hours.\n\n**Step 2:** Set the total number of practice hours equal to 10,000 hours.\n\n* 240x = 10,000\n* Divide both sides by 240:\n* x = 10,000 / 240.\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for x.\n\n* x = 41.67.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nRandy will need to practice for **41.67 hours every day** to become an expert piano player before the age of 20.\n\nI hope it is correct: 41.67",
        "ground_truth": "Randy has 20 \u2013 12 = <<20-12=8>>8 years until he is 20.\nHe must practice 10,000 hours / 8 years = <<10000/8=1250>>1,250 hours a year to become an expert.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year \u2013 2 weeks of vacation Randy plans to take = <<52-2=50>>50 weeks of practice for Randy.\nRandy will practice Monday \u2013 Friday, which is 5 days a week, so 50 weeks x 5 days = <<50*5=250>>250 days of practice each year.\nRandy will need to practice 1250 hours / 250 days = <<1250/250=5>>5 hours each day.\n#### 5"
