At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe school band has 30 songs in their repertoire. The band played 5 songs in their first set and 7 in their second set. The band will play 2 songs for their encore. Assuming the band plays through their entire repertoire, how many songs will they play on average in the third and fourth sets?",
