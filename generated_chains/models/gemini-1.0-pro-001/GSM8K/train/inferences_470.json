        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of overtime hours Gary worked.  He earned $12 per hour for 40 hours, or $480.  He also earned $18 per hour ($12 * 1.5) for $x$ hours, or $18x.  So, his total earnings are $480 + $18x$ which equals $696.  This gives us the equation $$480 + 18x = 696.$$ Subtracting 480 from both sides, we have $$18x = 216.$$ Dividing both sides by 18, we have $$x = 12.$$ I hope it is correct: The number of overtime hours Gary worked that week is $12$",
        "ground_truth": "Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.\nThis means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.\nHis overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.\nSo Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.\nSo in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = <<40+12=52>>52 hours that week.\n#### 52"
