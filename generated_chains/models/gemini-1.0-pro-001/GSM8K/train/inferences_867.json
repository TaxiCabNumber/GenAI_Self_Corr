At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBob runs 6 miles per hour. His friend Jim runs at 9 miles per hour. If Bob has a 1 mile head-start, how many minutes will it take before Jim catches him?",
        "inference": "1. Find the speed difference between Jim and Bob. 9 mph - 6 mph = 3 mph\n2. Convert the speed difference to miles per minute. 3 mph * (1/60) = 0.05 miles per minute\n3. Since Bob has a 1-mile head start, subtract that from the total distance that Jim needs to run to catch him. 1 mile - 1 mile = 0 miles.\n4. Divide the total distance by the speed difference to find the time it will take for Jim to catch Bob. 0 miles / 0.05 miles per minute = 0 minutes\nI hope it is correct: 0 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "Bob runs .1 miles per minute because 6 / 60 = <<6/60=.1>>.1\nJim run at .15 miles per minute 9 / 60 = <<9/60=.15>>.15\nWe know that .1(Number of Minutes) + 1 = .15(Number of Minutes)\nTherefore 1 = .05(Number of minutes)\nTherefore (Number of minutes) = 20 because 1 / .05 = <<1/.05=20>>20\n#### 20"
