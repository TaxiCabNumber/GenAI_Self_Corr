At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?",
        "inference": "The teacher needs 11 vampire-themed bags and 14 pumpkin-themed bags.\nShe can buy 2 packs of vampire-themed bags and 1 individual vampire-themed bag, for a total of $7.\nShe can buy 2 packs of pumpkin-themed bags and 4 individual pumpkin-themed bags, for a total of $12.\nThe total cost is $7 + $12 = $19.\nI hope it is correct: 19",
        "ground_truth": "Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $<<2*3+1*1=7>>7.\nSimilarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $<<2*3+4*1=10>>10.\nTherefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $<<7+10=17>>17.\n#### 17"
