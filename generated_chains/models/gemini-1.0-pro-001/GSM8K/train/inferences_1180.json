At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA local restaurant is offering an 8 piece fried chicken bucket and 2 sides for $12.00 that will feed 6 people.  If Monty was having a family reunion for 36 family members, how much will it cost him to buy enough chicken and sides to feed everyone one serving?",
