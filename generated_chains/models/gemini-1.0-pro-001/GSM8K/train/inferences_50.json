He wants to use the months he's not playing baseball to save up by raking, shoveling, and mowing lawns. He charges $10 for each. How many chores does he need to average a month to save up for his supplies?",
        "inference": "1. To calculate how much money Gerald spends on baseball supplies in the 4 months of his season, we multiply $100 by 4:\n$100 x 4 = $400\n\n2. To determine how much money Gerald needs to save for his baseball supplies, we subtract the amount he spends from the total amount he needs:\n$400 - $100 = $300\n\n3. To calculate how many chores Gerald needs to do each month to save up, we divide the amount he needs to save by the number of months he has to save:\n$300 / 3 = 100 chores\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 chores.",
        "ground_truth": "He needs to save up $400 because 4 x 100 = <<4*100=400>>400\nHe has 8 months to earn this money because 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8\nHe needs to earn $50 a month because 400 / 8 = <<400/8=50>>50\nHe needs to do 5 tasks a month because 50 / 10 = <<50/10=5>>5\n#### 5"
