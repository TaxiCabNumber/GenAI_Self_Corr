At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA town is holding a fireworks display for New Year\u2019s Eve. They light enough fireworks to show the full year then light enough fireworks to write \u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR\u201d in the sky. They then light another 50 boxes of fireworks as part of the display. Each box of fireworks contains 8 fireworks. If it takes 6 fireworks to display a number and 5 fireworks to display a letter, how many fireworks are lit during the display?",
        "inference": "To display the year, which has 4 digits, 4 * 6 = 24 fireworks are needed.\nTo display \"HAPPY NEW YEAR\", which has 13 letters, 13 * 5 = 65 fireworks are needed. \nIn total, 24 + 65 = 89 fireworks are needed for the year and the greeting. \nAdding the 50 boxes of fireworks, each containing 8 fireworks, gives 89 + 50 * 8 = 89 + 400 = 489 fireworks.\nI hope it is correct: 489",
        "ground_truth": "Writing out the full year uses 4 numbers so this takes 4 numbers * 6 fireworks per number = <<4*6=24>>24 fireworks.\n\u201cHAPPY NEW YEAR\u201d contains 12 letters so this takes 12 letters * 5 fireworks per letter = <<12*5=60>>60 fireworks.\nThere is therefore a total of 24 + 60 = <<24+60=84>>84 fireworks lit at the start of the display.\nFrom the boxes, they lit another 50 boxes * 8 fireworks per box = <<50*8=400>>400 fireworks.\nSo in total, the whole display uses 84 + 400 = <<84+400=484>>484 fireworks.\n#### 484"
