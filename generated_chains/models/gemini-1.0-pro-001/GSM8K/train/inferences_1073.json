What is the number of fish left in the sea, if fishers catch 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward?",
        "inference": "1) Calculate the number of fish that swam eastward and westward:\n1,800 fish swam westward, and 3,200 fish swam eastward. So the total number of fish that swam eastward and westward is 1,800 + 3,200 = 5,000 fish.\n\n2) Calculate the number of fish that the fishers caught:\nThe fishers caught 2/5 of the fish that swam eastward and 3/4 of the fish that swam westward. So the number of fish that the fishers caught is 2/5 x 3,200 + 3/4 x 1,800 = 1,280 + 1,350 = 2,630 fish.\n\n3) Calculate the number of fish left in the sea:\nThe number of fish left in the sea is the total number of fish that swam eastward and westward minus the number of fish that the fishers caught. So the number of fish left in the sea is 5,000 - 2,630 = 2,370 fish.\nI hope it is correct: 2,370",
