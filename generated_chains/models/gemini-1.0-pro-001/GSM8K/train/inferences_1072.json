At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe GooGoo brand of clothing manufactures two types of shirts, one with 3 buttons and the other with 5 buttons.  A large department store ordered GooGoo to manufacture 200 of each type of shirt.  How many buttons will the GooGoo brand use to manufacturer all of the shirts for this order?",
