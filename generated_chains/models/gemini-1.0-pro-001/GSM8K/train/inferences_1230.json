        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCasey wants to decorate  her toenails and fingernails. First, she wants to do a base coat on each nail, then a coat of paint and finally a coat of glitter on every nail. It takes 20 minutes to apply each coat and 20 minutes for each coat to dry before applying the next one. Assuming Casey's nails will be done when all coats have been applied and dried,  how many minutes will it take her to finish decorating her fingernails and toenails?",
        "inference": "First, we need to calculate the time it takes to apply each coat to all 20 nails. There are 10 fingers and 10 toes, so there are 20 nails in total. It takes 20 minutes to apply each coat, so it will take 20 x 20 = 400 minutes to apply all three coats to all 20 nails.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time it takes for each coat to dry on all 20 nails. It takes 20 minutes for each coat to dry, so it will take 20 x 3 = 60 minutes for all three coats to dry on all 20 nails.\n\nFinally, we need to add the time it takes to apply all three coats to the time it takes for all three coats to dry. 400 minutes + 60 minutes = 460 minutes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 460 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "Casey wants to paint her 10 toenails + 10 fingernails = <<10+10=20>>20 nails in total.\nFirst she wants to do a base coat which takes 20 minutes to apply + 20 minutes to dry = <<20+20=40>>40 minutes total for the first coat.\nIt will take the same amount of time to do a coat of paint and let it dry and to do a coat of glitter and let it dry, 40 minutes x 3 different coats = <<40*3=120>>120 minutes total to paint her toenails and fingernails.\n#### 120"
