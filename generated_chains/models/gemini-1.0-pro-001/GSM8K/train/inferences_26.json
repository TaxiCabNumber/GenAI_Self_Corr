At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",
