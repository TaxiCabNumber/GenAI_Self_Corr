At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGrace can read a 200-page book in 20 hours. How long would it take her to finish reading a 250-page book at this constant rate?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the number of hours it takes Grace to read the 250-page book. Since her reading rate is constant, the number of pages she reads per hour is $\\frac{200}{20}=10$. Therefore, the number of pages she reads in $x$ hours is $10x$. Since she needs to read 250 pages, we have the equation $10x=250$. Solving for $x$, we get\n\n```\n10x=250\nx=25\n```\n\nTherefore, it would take Grace 25 hours to finish reading the 250-page book.\n\nI hope it is correct: 25",
        "ground_truth": "Grace can read 200/20 = <<200/20=10>>10 pages in 1 hour.\nSo she can finish a 250-page book in 250/10 = <<250/10=25>>25 hours.\n#### 25"
