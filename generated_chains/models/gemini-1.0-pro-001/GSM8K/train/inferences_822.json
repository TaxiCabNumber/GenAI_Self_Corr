She bought 4 packs, and each pack contains 15 cupcakes, so she has 4 * 15 = 60 cupcakes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cupcakes she needs to buy in packs of 10 to give one cupcake to 100 children. She needs 100 - 60 = 40 cupcakes.\n\nFinally, we need to find out how many packs of 10 cupcakes she needs to buy.
