At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohnny has been playing guitar for a while now.  He practices the same amount each day. As of 20 days ago he had half as much practice as he has currently.  How many days will pass before Johnny has 3 times as much practice as he does currently?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of days that have passed since Johnny started practicing. 20 days ago, Johnny had half as much practice as he has currently. This means that x \u2013 20 = 1/2 * x. Solving for x, we get x = 40. This means that Johnny has been practicing for 40 days. Johnny will have 3 times as much practice as he does currently in x days. This means that 3 * (40 + x) = 40 + x + x. Solving for x, we get x = 40. I hope it is correct: 40",
