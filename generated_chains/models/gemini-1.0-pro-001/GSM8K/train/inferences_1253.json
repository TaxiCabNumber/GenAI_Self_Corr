At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDanai is decorating her house for Halloween. She puts 12 plastic skulls all around the house. She has 4 broomsticks, 1 for each side of the front and back doors to the house. She puts up 12 spiderwebs around various areas of the house. Danai puts twice as many pumpkins around the house as she put spiderwebs. She also places a large cauldron on the dining room table. If Danai has the budget left to buy 20 more decorations and has 10 left to put up, how many decorations will she put up in all?",

She then put up 10 more decorations, giving her a total of 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 + 10 = 62 decorations.\n3. Danai still has 20 decorations left to buy, so she will have 62 + 20 = 82 decorations in all.\n\nI hope it is correct: 82",
        "ground_truth": "Danai places 12 skulls + 4 broomsticks + 12 spiderwebs + 1 cauldron = <<12+4+12+1=29>>29 decorations.\nShe also puts up twice as many pumpkins around the house as she put spiderwebs, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pumpkins.\nDanai will also add 20 + 10 decorations to the 29 + 24 decorations already up = 83 total decorations Danai will put up.\n#### 83"
