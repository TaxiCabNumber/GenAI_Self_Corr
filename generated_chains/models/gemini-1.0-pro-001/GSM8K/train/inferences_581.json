At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn ten years, I'll be twice my brother's age. The sum of our ages will then be 45 years old. How old am I now?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's express my age as x, and my brother's age as y.  We are given:\n\n1. In ten years, I'll be twice my brother's age:  x + 10 = 2(y + 10)  \n2. The sum of our ages will then be 45 years old:  (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45  \n\nSimplifying the first equation:  x + 10 = 2y + 20  x - 2y = 10  \n\nSimplifying the second equation:  (x + 10) + (y + 10) = 45  x + y = 25  \n\nNow we have two equations with two variables, x and y:  x - 2y = 10  x + y = 25  \n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution. Solve the second equation for x:  x = 25 - y  \n\nSubstitute this expression for x into the first equation:  (25 - y) - 2y = 10  -3y = -15  y = 5  \n\nNow substitute the value of y back into the equation x = 25 - y:  x = 25 - 5  x = 20\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
