At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSally and Bob have made plans to go on a trip at the end of the year. They both decide to work as babysitters and save half of what they've earned for their trip. If Sally makes $6 per day and Bob makes $4 per day, how much money will they both have saved for their trip after a year?",
