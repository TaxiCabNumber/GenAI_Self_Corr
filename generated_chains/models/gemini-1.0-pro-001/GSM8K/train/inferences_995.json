At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJosh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?",
        "inference": "* We know that the sum of their ages is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married.\n* Let's say Anna was 'x' years old when they got married. Then Josh was 22 years old when they got married.\n* The sum of their ages when they got married was x + 22 years.\n* 30 years later, their combined age is x + 22 + 30 = x + 52 years.\n* We are told that their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married. So, x + 52 = 5 * 22.\n* Solving for 'x', we get x = 2.\n* Therefore, Anna was 2 years old when they got married.\n\nI hope it is correct: 2",
