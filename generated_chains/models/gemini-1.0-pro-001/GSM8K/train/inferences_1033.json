At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames takes up dancing for fitness.  He loses twice as many calories per hour as he did when he was walking.  He dances twice a day for .5 hours each time and he does this 4 times a week.  He burned 300 calories an hour walking.  How many calories does he lose a week from dancing?",

He dances for 0.5 hour twice a day, so 0.5 x 2 = 1 hour a day.\n4. He dances 4 times a week, so 1 hour x 4 days = 4 hours a week.\n5. He burns 600 calories per hour dancing, so 4 hours x 600 calories/hour = 2,400 calories a week.\n\nI hope it is correct: 2,400",
