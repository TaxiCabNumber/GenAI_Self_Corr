At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJustin bought some jerseys. He bought four long-sleeved ones that cost $15 each, and some striped ones that cost $10 each. How many striped jerseys did Justin buy if he spent a total of $80?",
