At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLana and her friends go to a theater on the weekend to watch a new play Joan told them was live. When they arrived, Lana saw 100 cars in the front parking lot. She saw two times more vehicles at the back than there were in the front parking lot. If the total number of cars at the end of the play was 700, how many more cars packed into the parking lot during the play?",
