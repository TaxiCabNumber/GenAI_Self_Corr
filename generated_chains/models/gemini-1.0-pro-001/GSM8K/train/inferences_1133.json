At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcus is having a water balloon party. He has 100 balloons. Each balloon holds 3 ounces of water. He can buy 50 ounces of water for $2.5 a bottle. If he walks into the store with 2 $10 bills, how much change will he have after he buys all the water he needs?",

Marcus gave the cashier 2 * $10 = $20, so he would get back $20 - $30 = -$10 in change\nI hope it is correct: -$10",
