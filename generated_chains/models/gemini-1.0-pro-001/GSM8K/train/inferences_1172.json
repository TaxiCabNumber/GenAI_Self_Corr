        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nColbert is building a treehouse out of wooden planks. The treehouse needs 200 wooden planks. A quarter of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s storage, half of these planks come from Colbert\u2019s parents, 20 planks come from Colbert\u2019s friends and he buys the rest from the store. How many planks of wood does he need to buy from the store to finish his treehouse?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of planks Colbert has from his storage.\n200 * 1/4 = 50 planks\n\n2. Calculate the number of planks Colbert has from his parents.\n200 * 1/2 = 100 planks\n\n3. Add the number of planks Colbert has from his friends to the number of planks he has from his parents and his storage.\n50 + 100 + 20 = 170 planks\n\n4. Subtract the number of planks Colbert has from the total number of planks he needs to buy.\n200 - 170 = 30 planks\n\nI hope it is correct: 30 planks",
        "ground_truth": "In Colbert\u2019s storage, there are 200 wooden planks / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 wooden planks.\nFrom his parents, there are 200 wooden planks / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 wooden planks.\nSo in total, Colbert has not had to buy 50 wooden planks from storage + 100 wooden planks from his parents + 20 wooden planks from his friends = <<50+100+20=170>>170 wooden planks.\nHe therefore still needs to buy 200 needed wooden planks \u2013 170 owned wooden planks = <<200-170=30>>30 wooden planks.\n#### 30"
