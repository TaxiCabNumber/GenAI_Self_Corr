At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKimberley, Ela, and Houston all are sent to collect firewood by their grammy. Kimberley collects ten pounds of firewood, and Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood. If the three of them managed to collect a total of 35 pounds of firewood, how many pounds were collected by Ela?",
        "inference": "The total amount of firewood collected is 35 pounds. Kimberley collected 10 pounds, and Houston collected 12 pounds. So, Ela must have collected 35 - 10 - 12 = 13 pounds.\nI hope it is correct: 13",
        "ground_truth": "Kimberley and Houston collected 10+12 = <<10+12=22>>22 pounds of firewood.\nYou can find how much Ela collected by subtracting that amount from the total amount collected: 35-22 = <<35-22=13>>13 pounds.\n#### 13"
