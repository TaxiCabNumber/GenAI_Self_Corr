At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Roberts can buy a television for $400 cash or $120 down payment and $30 a month for 12 months. How much can he save by paying cash?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n1. Find the total cost of buying the television on installment:\nDown payment: $120\n12 monthly payments: $30 x 12 = $360\nTotal cost on installment: $120 + $360 = $480\n\n2. Subtract the total cash price from the total installment price:\nSavings = $480 - $400 = $80\n\nI hope it is correct: $80$",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Roberts will make a total payment of $30 x 12 = $<<30*12=360>>360 for 12 months.\nThus, the television costs $360 + $120 = $<<360+120=480>>480 when not paid in cash.\nTherefore, Mr. Roberts can save $480 - $400 = $<<480-400=80>>80 by paying cash.\n#### 80"
