It still had 10 games to play. How many games can they lose to win 60% of their games?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the total number of wins and losses.\n\nThe team has won 70% of 40 games, so it has won 0.7 x 40 = 28 games.\nTherefore, the team has lost 40 - 28 = 12 games.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the target winning percentage.\n\nThe team wants to win 60% of its total games, including the 10 games to play.\nSo, the team needs to win 0.6 x (40 + 10) = 30 games.\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the number of losses allowed.\n\nTo win 30 games, the team can lose a maximum of 40 + 10 - 30 = 20 games.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
