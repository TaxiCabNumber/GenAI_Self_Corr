At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark wants to set the record for most consecutive ropes jumped.  The record is 54,000.  He can jump 3 times a second.  How many hours would he need to jump rope?",

        "ground_truth": "He can jump 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 times per minute\nSo he can jump 180*60=<<180*60=10800>>10,800 per hour\nSo it would take him 54,000/10,800=<<54000/10800=5>>5 hours\n#### 5"
