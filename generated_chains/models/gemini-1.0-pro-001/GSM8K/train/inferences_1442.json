At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJame is trying to learn to tear playing cards.  He can tear 30 cards at a time.  A new deck of cards has 55 cards if you include the jokers and blank cards.  He tears cards 3 times a week.  If he buys 18 decks how many weeks can he go?",
        "inference": "18 decks = 18 * 55 = 990 cards\n990 / 30 = 33\n33 / 3 = 11\nI hope it is correct: 11 weeks",
        "ground_truth": "He tears 30*3=<<30*3=90>>90 cards a week\nHe bought 55*18=<<55*18=990>>990 cards\nSo he can tear for 990/90=<<990/90=11>>11 weeks\n#### 11"
