At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Caiden wants to do repairs to his house and requires 300 feet of metal roofing to do this. If each foot of roofing costs $8, and the supplier of the metal roofing brings in 250 feet of metal roofing for free, how much money is Mr. Caiden required to pay for the remaining metal roofing?",

Subtract the free roofing from the total amount needed: 300 feet - 250 feet = 50 feet\n4. Calculate the cost per foot of roofing: $8 per foot\n5. Multiply the remaining amount of roofing needed by the cost per foot: 50 feet x $8 per foot = $400\nI hope it is correct: $400$",
        "ground_truth": "The supplier brought 300 ft - 250 ft = <<300-250=50>>50 fewer feet of metal roofing.\nTherefore the total amount of money Mr. Caiden has to pay for the remaining metal roofings is 50 feet * $8/foot = $<<50*8=400>>400\n#### 400"
