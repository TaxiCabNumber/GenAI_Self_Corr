At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. If Brenda weighs 220 pounds, what is Mel's weight?",
        "inference": "Let's represent Mel's weight with the variable 'm'.  Since Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight, we can represent Brenda's weight as '3m + 10'. We are given that Brenda weighs 220 pounds, so we can set up the equation:\n```\n3m + 10 = 220\n```\nNow, we solve the equation for 'm':\n```\n3m = 220 - 10\n3m = 210\nm = 210 / 3\nm = 70\n```\nTherefore, Mel's weight is 70 pounds.\nI hope it is correct: 70",
        "ground_truth": "Let Mel's weight be m\nBrenda\u2019s weight is 3*m + 10 = 220 pounds\nThus 3m = 220 - 10 = 210 pounds\nTherefore Mel's weight is m = 210/3 = <<210/3=70>>70 pounds\n#### 70"
