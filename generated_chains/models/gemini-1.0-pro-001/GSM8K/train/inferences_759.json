At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom wants to make the world's largest dough ball.  He needs 500 pounds of flour and he can buy 50-pound bags of flour for $20.  He also needs 10 pounds of salt and salt cost $.2 a pound.  He also spends $1000 promoting everything.  He then sells tickets for $20 each and sells 500 tickets.  How much money did he make?",
