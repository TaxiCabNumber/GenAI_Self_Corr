At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are some jelly beans in a jar. Three fourths of the jelly beans are red, and one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. If 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored, how many jelly beans are there in the jar?",
        "inference": "Let's call the total number of jelly beans in the jar \"x\".  Since three fourths of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is (3/4)x.  Since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is (1/4)(3/4)x = (3/16)x.  We know that the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is 750, so we can set up the equation (3/16)x = 750.  Solving for x, we get x = 750 * (16/3) = 4000.  Therefore, there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.\nI hope it is correct: 4000",
