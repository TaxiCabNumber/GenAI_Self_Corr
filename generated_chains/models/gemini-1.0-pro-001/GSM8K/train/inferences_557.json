If he dries half the tomatoes and turns a third of the remainder into marinara sauce, how many tomatoes are left?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Total tomatoes: 18 plants x 7 tomatoes/plant = 126 tomatoes.\n2. Half of the tomatoes are dried: 126 tomatoes / 2 = 63 dried tomatoes.\n3. A third of the remaining tomatoes are turned into marinara sauce: 126 tomatoes - 63 dried tomatoes = 63 remaining tomatoes; 63 remaining tomatoes / 3 = 21 tomatoes for marinara sauce.\n4. Left over tomatoes: 63 remaining tomatoes - 21 tomatoes for marinara sauce = **42 tomatoes left over.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 42",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total number of tomatoes harvested: 18 plants * 7 tomatoes/plant = <<18*7=126>>126 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 2 to find how many tomatoes are left undried: 126 tomatoes / 2 = <<126/2=63>>63 tomatoes\nThen divide that number by 3 to find how many tomatoes are turned into sauce: 63 tomatoes / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 tomatoes\nThen subtract that number from the number of undried tomatoes to find the remaining number of tomatoes: 63 tomatoes - 21 tomatoes = <<63-21=42>>42 tomatoes\n#### 42"
