At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarla is taking attendance for her sixth-grade class. She knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. If there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, how many students does Carla teach, including the ones in and out of the classroom?",
