At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe buyers who came to Mr. Brandon's shop yesterday bought goods worth $80. If 2/5 of the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday were credit sales, and the rest were cash sales, how much did Mr. Brandon get from cash sales?",
        "inference": "1. Let the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday be x.\n2. Then, the amount of credit sales = 2/5 * x = 2x/5\n3. Therefore, the amount of cash sales = x - 2x/5 = 3x/5\n4. Substituting x = $80, we get the amount of cash sales = 3 * $80/5 = $48\nI hope it is correct: $48",
        "ground_truth": "2/5 of the total amount of sales Mr. Brandon made yesterday, which were credit purchases, were worth 2/5*$80=$<<2/5*80=32>>32\nThe cash sales that Mr. Brandon made yesterday was $80-$32=$<<80-32=48>>48\n#### 48"
