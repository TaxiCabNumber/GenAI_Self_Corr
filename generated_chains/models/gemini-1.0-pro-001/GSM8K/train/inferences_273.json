At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUrsula is working at a marketing firm. She created a 30-second long commercial. Her boss told her that this commercial is too long to air and told her to shorten the commercial by 30%. How long will this commercial be after Ursula makes the desired changes?",
