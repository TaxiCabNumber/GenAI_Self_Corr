Jess has to walk 11 blocks to the store and 6 blocks to the gallery, before walking the final 8 blocks to arrive at work. If Jess has already walked 5 blocks, how many more blocks must she walk before arriving at work?",

We know she has to walk 11 blocks to the store, 6 blocks to the gallery, and 8 blocks to work, for a total of 11 + 6 + 8 = 25 blocks.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of blocks Jess has already walked from the total number of blocks she has to walk. We know she has already walked 5 blocks, so we need to subtract 5 from 25, which gives us 20 blocks.\n\nTherefore, Jess must walk 20 more blocks before arriving at work.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
