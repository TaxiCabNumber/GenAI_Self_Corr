At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA roadwork company is paving a newly constructed 16-mile road. They use a mixture of pitch and gravel to make the asphalt to pave the road. Each truckloads of asphalt uses two bags of gravel and five times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch to make. It takes three truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. The company paved 4 miles of road on one day, then one mile less than double that on the second day. How many barrels of pitch will the company need to finish the remaining road on the third day?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\n**Step 1**\nEach truckload of asphalt uses 2 bags of gravel and 10 barrels of pitch.\nEach truckload of asphalt paves 1/3 of a mile of road.\nThe company paved 4 miles of road on one day, and 7 miles of road on the second day.\nSo, the company has paved 11 miles of road so far.\nThe company needs to pave 5 more miles of road.\nThe company needs 3 * 10 = 30 barrels of pitch to pave each mile of road.\nSo, the company needs 5 * 30 = 150 barrels of pitch to finish the remaining road.\n\n**Answer**\nI hope it is correct: 150",
        "ground_truth": "On the second day, the company paved 4 * 2 - 1 = <<4*2-1=7>>7 miles.\nThe company has 16 - 7 - 4 = <<16-7-4=5>>5 miles of road remaining to pave.\nThey will need 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 truckloads of asphalt to pave 5 miles of road.\nFor 15 truckloads, they will need 15 * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 bags of gravel.\nThus, the company will need 30 / 5 = <<30/5=6>>6 barrels of pitch to finish the road on the third day.\n#### 6"
