At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMy new house has 12 medium ceiling lights but I have seen small and large ceiling lights in other rooms. The small ones require 1 bulb, the medium ones require 2, and the large ones need 3 bulbs. How many bulbs should I buy if my wife says she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights and ten more small lights than medium ones?",
        "inference": "- My wife said she saw twice as many large ceiling lights as medium ceiling lights. So, if the medium ceiling lights are 12, the large ceiling lights are 24 (12 * 2 = 24).\n- My wife said she saw ten more small lights than medium ones. So, if the medium ceiling lights are 12, the small ceiling lights are 22 (12 + 10 = 22).\n- The medium ceiling lights require 2 bulbs, so I need 12 * 2 = 24 bulbs for them.\n- The large ceiling lights require 3 bulbs, so I need 24 * 3 = 72 bulbs for them.\n- The small ceiling lights require 1 bulb, so I need 22 * 1 = 22 bulbs for them.\n- In total, I need 24 + 72 + 22 = 118 bulbs.\n\nI hope it is correct: 118",
