At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEvery day, Sara bakes 10 cakes and puts them in his refrigerator. He does this for 5 days. Carol then comes over and eats 12 of his cakes. If it takes 2 cans of frosting to frost a single cake, how many cans of frosting does Bob need to frost the remaining cakes?",

It takes 2 cans of frosting to frost each cake, so Sara needs a total of 38 * 2 = 76 cans of frosting to frost the remaining cakes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 76",
