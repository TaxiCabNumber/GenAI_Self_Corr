        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Lu owns a computer store. For last month, half of their sales are laptops, one-third are netbooks, and the rest are desktop computers. If Mr. Lu's store was able to sell a total of 72 computers, how many of them are desktop computers?",
        "inference": "1. Find the number of laptops sold.\n2. Find the number of netbooks sold.\n3. Subtract the number of laptops and netbooks sold from the total number of computers sold to find the number of desktop computers sold.\n\n\n1. Number of laptops sold = 1/2 * 72 = 36\n2. Number of netbooks sold = 1/3 * 72 = 24\n3. Number of desktop computers sold = 72 - 36 - 24 = 12\n\nI hope it is correct: 12",
        "ground_truth": "There were 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 laptops sold.\nThere were 72/3 = <<72/3=24>>24 netbooks sold.\nSo, there were a total of 36 + 24 = <<36+24=60>>60 laptops and netbooks sold.\nThus, 72 - 60 = <<72-60=12>>12 desktop computers were sold last month.\n#### 12"
