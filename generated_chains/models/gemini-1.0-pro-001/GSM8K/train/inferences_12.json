He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?",

Add the number of mango trees and coconut trees to find the total number of trees:\n\nTotal trees = Mango trees + Coconut trees\n\n= 60 + 25\n= 85\n\n**Answer:**\n\nI hope it is correct: 85",
