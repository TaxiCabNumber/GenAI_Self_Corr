        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nConner has a dune buggy that he rides in the desert.  On flat sand, it can ride at a speed of 60 miles per hour.  When traveling on downhill slopes, it can race at 12 miles per hour faster than it can when it is on flat sand.  And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "**Step 1): Find the speed on downhill slopes:**\nSpeed on flat sand = 60 mph\nSpeed on downhill slopes = Speed on flat sand + 12 mph\nSpeed on downhill slopes = 60 mph + 12 mph\nSpeed on downhill slopes = 72 mph\n\n**Step 2): Find the speed on uphill slopes:**\nSpeed on flat sand = 60 mph\nSpeed on uphill slopes = Speed on flat sand - 18 mph\nSpeed on uphill slopes = 60 mph - 18 mph\nSpeed on uphill slopes = 42 mph\n\n**Step 3): Find the average speed:**\nAverage speed = (Speed on flat sand + Speed on downhill slopes + Speed on uphill slopes) / 3\nAverage speed = (60 mph + 72 mph + 42 mph) / 3\nAverage speed = 174 mph / 3\nI hope it is correct: Average speed = 58 mph",
        "ground_truth": "12 mph faster than 60mph is 60+12=<<60+12=72>>72 mph.\n18 mph slower than 60 mph is 60-18=<<60-18=42>>42 mph.\nIf he spends 1/3 of the time at each of these three speeds, then he averages (60+72+42)/3 = <<(60+72+42)/3=58>>58 mph.\n#### 58"
