At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 4 puppies and 3 dogs at a camp. Each dog eats twice as much food as a puppy, but each puppy eats three times as often as a dog. If a dog eats 4 pounds of food three times a day, what would be the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day?",

Calculate how much food a dog eats in a day.\nA dog eats 12 pounds of food three times a day, so a dog eats 12 * 3 = 36 pounds of food in a day.\n\n3. Calculate the total amount of food the dogs eat in a day.\nThere are 3 dogs, so the total amount of food the dogs eat in a day is 36 * 3 = 108 pounds of food.\n\n4. Calculate the total amount of food the puppies eat in a day.\nThere are 4 puppies, so the total amount of food the puppies eat in a day is 12 * 4 = 48 pounds of food.\n\n5. Calculate the total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day.\nThe total amount of food the dogs and puppies eat in a day is 108 + 48 = 156 pounds of food.\nI hope it is correct: 156",
