His team has played 15 games this season. He has a goal of averaging 30 points per game for the entire 20 game season. How many points does he need to average per game to reach his goal?",

Find the total number of points he has already scored in the 15 games he has played.\n26 points per game x 15 games = 390 points\n\n3. Subtract the total number of points he has already scored from the total number of points he needs to score.\n520 points - 390 points = 130 points\n\n4. Divide the number of points he needs to score by the number of games he has left to play.\n130 points / 5 games = 26 points per game\n\nI hope it is correct: 26",
