At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 3 meatballs on each spaghetti plate.  If Theresa's 3 sons each eat two-thirds of the meatballs on their respective plates, how many meatballs are still left on their plates altogether?",

So, each son eats: (2/3) * 3 = 2 meatballs.\nTherefore, the total number of meatballs eaten by all three sons is: 2 * 3 = 6 meatballs.\nFinally, the number of meatballs still left on their plates altogether is: 9 meatballs - 6 meatballs = 3 meatballs.\nI hope it is correct: 3 meatballs",
