        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark was caught speeding and the judge wants to make an example out of him. The base fine for speeding is $50 but additional penalties apply in this case.  The fine is increased by $2 for every mile per hour Mark was going over the speed limit. He was going 75 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone. The fine is also doubled because he was in a school zone. Finally, the judge makes Mark pay $300 in court costs and he also has to pay his lawyer $80/hour for three hours of work. How much does Mark owe for this speeding ticket?",
        "inference": "1. Base fine of $50\n2. Additional fine for speeding: (75 - 30) mph = 45 mph * $2/mph = $90\n3. Fine is doubled for being in a school zone: $50 + $90 = $140 * 2 = $280\n4. Court costs: $300\n5. Lawyer fees: $80/hour * 3 hours = $240\n6. Total fine: $280 + $300 + $240 = $820\nI hope it is correct: $820",
        "ground_truth": "First figure out how many miles over the speed limit Mark was going: 75 mph - 30 mph = <<75-30=45>>45 mph\nNow figure out how much the per-mile fine is: $2/mph * 45 mph = $<<2*45=90>>90\nNow add that amount to the base fine: $90 + $50 = $<<90+50=140>>140\nNow double that amount for being in a school zone: $140 * 2 = $<<140*2=280>>280\nNow figure out how much Mark owes his lawyer: $80/hour * 3 hours = $<<80*3=240>>240\nNow add the court costs, lawyer fees and fine: $240 + $300 + $280 = $<<240+300+280=820>>820\n#### 820"
