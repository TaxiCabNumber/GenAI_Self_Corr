At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLucia is a dancer. She takes 2 hip-hop classes a week, 2 ballet classes a week, and 1 jazz class a week. One hip-hop class costs $10. One ballet class costs $12, and one jazz class costs $8. What is the total cost of Lucia\u2019s dance classes in one week?",
        "inference": "1. We know that Lucia takes 2 hip-hop classes a week, 2 ballet classes a week, and 1 jazz class a week.\n2. We also know that one hip-hop class costs $10, one ballet class costs $12, and one jazz class costs $8.\n3. To find the total cost of Lucia\u2019s dance classes in one week, we need to multiply the cost of each type of class by the number of classes she takes each week, and then add the results together.\n4. So, the total cost of Lucia\u2019s hip-hop classes in one week is 2 x $10 = $20.\n5. The total cost of Lucia\u2019s ballet classes in one week is 2 x $12 = $24.\n6. The total cost of Lucia\u2019s jazz class in one week is 1 x $8 = $8.\n7. Therefore, the total cost of Lucia\u2019s dance classes in one week is $20 + $24 + $8 = $52.\n\nI hope it is correct: $52",
