        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMatthew, the baker, arrives at work early every morning to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes for the day.  It usually takes Matthew 1 hour to assemble ingredients, 1.5 hours to bake the cakes, and another 1 hour to decorate each cake with cinnamon sprinkles.  One day, Matthew's oven failed to reach the correct temperature and it took twice as long for the cakes to bake as they usually take.  On that day, how long did it take, in hours, for Matthew to make his famous caramel-apple coffee cakes?",
        "inference": "- **Step 1:** Matthew usually spends 1 hour assembling ingredients, and another 1 hour decorating each cake. This means he spends a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours on these tasks.\n\n- **Step 2:** On the day the oven failed, it took twice as long for the cakes to bake. This means instead of taking 1.5 hours, it took 1.5 * 2 = 3 hours to bake the cakes.\n\n- **Step 3:** To find the total time it took Matthew to make the cakes that day, we add the time he spent assembling the ingredients (1 hour), the time he spent baking the cakes (3 hours), and the time he spent decorating the cakes (1 hour), which gives us 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 hours.\nI hope this is correct: 5 hours",
        "ground_truth": "Twice 1.5 hours is 2*1.5=<<2*1.5=3>>3 hours.\nThus, on that day, it took Matthew 1+3+1=<<1+3+1=5>>5 hours to make the cakes.\n#### 5"
