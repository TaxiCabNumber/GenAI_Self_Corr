At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOne of Robi's new year's resolutions is to start saving. He started to save $2 in January. This is followed by $4 in February and $8 in March. If he continues this saving pattern, how much will be his total savings after 6 months?",
