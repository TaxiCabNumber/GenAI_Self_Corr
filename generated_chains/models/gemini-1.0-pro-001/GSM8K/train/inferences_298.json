At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere were sweets on the table. Jack came and took half of all the candies and 4 more candies. Then Paul came and took the remaining 7 sweets. How many sweets were on the table at first?",
        "inference": "* Let the number of sweets be $x$.\n* Jack took half (i.e., $x/2$) of the sweets and 4 more. So, the number of sweets taken by Jack = $x/2 + 4$.\n* After that, 7 sweets were left. So, the number of sweets taken by Paul = 7.\n* Therefore, the total number of sweets on the table is $x/2 + 4 + 7 = x/2 + 11$.\n* To find the value of $x$, we need to solve the equation $x/2 + 11 = x$. \n* Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $x + 22 = 2x$. \n* Subtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $22 = x$.\n* Therefore, the number of sweets on the table at first was $x = 22$.\n\nI hope it is correct: 22",
        "ground_truth": "Jack took 4 more candies than the half, and Paul took the rest, which means 7 + 4 = 11 candies were half of all candies.\nThat means at first there were 11 * 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 candies.\n#### 22"
