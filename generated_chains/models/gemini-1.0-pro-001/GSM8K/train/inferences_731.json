A shirt costs $10 each and a pair of jeans costs twice as much. How much will the clothing store earn if all shirts and jeans are sold?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the cost of the shirts: 20 shirts x $10/shirt = $200\n2. Calculate the cost of the jeans: 10 pairs of jeans x $20/pair = $200\n3. Add the cost of the shirts and the cost of the jeans to find the total cost: $200 + $200 = $400\n4. Since all shirts and jeans are sold, the clothing store will earn the total cost: $400.\n\nI hope it is correct: $400$",
        "ground_truth": "Twenty shirts amount to $10 x 20 = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nThe cost of each pair of jeans is $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nSo 10 pairs of jeans amount to $20 x 10 = $<<20*10=200>>200.\nTherefore, the store will earn $200 + $200 = $<<200+200=400>>400 if all shirts and jeans are sold.\n#### 400"
