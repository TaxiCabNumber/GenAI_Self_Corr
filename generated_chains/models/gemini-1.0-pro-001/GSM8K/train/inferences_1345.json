At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMimi has decided to start going to the gym again. Over the weekend, she spent $8,000 on athletic sneakers and clothes. She spent thrice as much on Nike sneakers as she did on Adidas. What she spent on Adidas was 1/5 the cost of Skechers. If Mimi's Adidas sneakers purchase was $600, what amount did she spend on clothes?",
