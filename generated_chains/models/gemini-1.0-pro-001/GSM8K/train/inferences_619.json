He is paid to go on long walks with dogs while their families are away from home.  On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks 7 dogs.  On Tuesday, he walks 12 dogs.  And on Thursday he walks 9 dogs.  He is paid $5 for each dog that he walks.  How many dollars does Harry earn in a week?",

Harry walks 12 dogs on Tuesday, so he walks a total of 12 dogs on that day.\n3. Harry walks 9 dogs on Thursday, so he walks a total of 9 dogs on that day.\n4. Harry walks a total of 21 + 12 + 9 = 42 dogs in a week.\n5. Harry is paid $5 for each dog that he walks, so he earns a total of 42 x $5 = $210 in a week.\nI hope it is correct: $210",
        "ground_truth": "Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Harry walks a total of 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 dogs.\nThus, in a week he walks 21 + 12 + 9 = <<21+12+9=42>>42 dogs.\nAt a rate of $5 per dog, Harry ears $5 * 42 = $<<5*42=210>>210 per week.\n#### 210"
