At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to install a ramp in his house.  He needs to get permits which cost $250.  After that, he hires a contractor which costs $150 an hour and the guy works for 3 days at 5 hours per day.  He also pays an inspector 80% less to make sure it is OK.  How much was the total cost?",
