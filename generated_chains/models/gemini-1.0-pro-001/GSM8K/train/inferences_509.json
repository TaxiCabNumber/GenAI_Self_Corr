At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe electricity price in Coco's town is $0.10 per kW. Coco's new oven has a consumption rate of 2.4 kWh (kilowatt-hours). How much will Coco pay for using his oven only if he used it for a total of 25 hours last month?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the usage time from hours to kWh: 25 hours x 2.4 kWh/hour = 60 kWh\n2. Multiply the kWh by the electricity price: 60 kWh x $0.10/kWh = $6\nI hope it is correct: 6 $",
        "ground_truth": "If Coco used his oven 25 hours last month and its energy consumption is 2.4 kW per hour, then we consumed a total of 25*2.4= <<25*2.4=60>>60 kW on his oven last month\nIf the price of electricity is $0.10 per kW, then 60 kW would cost = $0.10*60 = $<<0.10*60=6>>6\n#### 6"
