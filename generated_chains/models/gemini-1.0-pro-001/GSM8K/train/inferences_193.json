At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelody planted sunflowers from two different seed packets. She found that the sunflowers from Packet A were 20% taller than the sunflowers from Packet B. If the sunflowers from Packet A were 192 inches tall, how tall were the sunflowers from Packet B?",
        "inference": "1. Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the heights of the sunflowers from the two packets:\n\nHeight of sunflowers from Packet A = 1.2 * Height of sunflowers from Packet B\n\n2. Substitute the given value for the height of the sunflowers from Packet A (192 inches) into the equation:\n\n192 inches = 1.2 * Height of sunflowers from Packet B\n\n3. Solve the equation for the height of the sunflowers from Packet B:\n\nHeight of sunflowers from Packet B = 192 inches / 1.2\n= 160 inches\n\nI hope it is correct: 160",
        "ground_truth": "The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.\nWe know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.\nTo figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.\n#### 160"
