At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA printing press is printing brochures. The press prints 20 single-page spreads, and twice as many double-page spreads. For each 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads, each of which take up a quarter of a page. The brochures can be arranged in any order as long as they are made up of 5 pages each. How many brochures is the printing press creating?",
        "inference": "-The press prints 20 single-page spreads, so 20 x 1 = 20 single pages.\n-The press prints twice as many double-page spreads, so 20 x 2 = 40 double pages.\n-Each double-page spread is made up of 2 pages, so 40 x 2 = 80 pages.\n-In total, there are 20 + 80 = 100 pages printed for the spreads.\n-For each 4 pages printed for the spreads, the press prints a block of 4 ads, each of which take up a quarter of a page.\n-So, there are 100 / 4 = 25 blocks of ads printed.\n-Each block of ads contains 4 ads, so there are 25 x 4 = 100 ads printed.\n-Each brochure is made up of 5 pages.\n-Therefore, the press can create 100 / 5 = 20 brochures.\nI hope it is correct: $20$",
