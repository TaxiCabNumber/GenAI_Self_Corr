At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJean has 3 grandchildren.  She buys each grandkid 2 cards a year and puts $80 in each card.  How much does she give away to grandchildren a year?",
        "inference": "1. Jean gives 2 cards to each of her 3 grandchildren. So, she gives away a total of 2 * 3 = 6 cards a year.\n\n\n2. Each card contains $80. So, the total amount of money Jean gives away in one card is 6 * $80 = $480.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 480",
        "ground_truth": "Each grandchild gets 2*80=$<<2*80=160>>160 a year\nSo that means they get a total of 3*160=$<<3*160=480>>480\n#### 480"
