She talks with each customer for a limited amount of time, and each phone call is charged five cents per minute. If each call lasts 1 hour, what's the phone bill at the end of the month if she manages to talk to 50 customers a week?",

Multiply the number of minutes by the number of customers per week: 60 minutes/call * 50 customers/week = 3000 minutes/week\n3. Multiply the number of minutes by the cost per minute: 3000 minutes/week * $0.05/minute = $150/week\n4. Multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a month: $150/week * 4 weeks/month = $600/month\n\nI hope it is correct: $600$",
