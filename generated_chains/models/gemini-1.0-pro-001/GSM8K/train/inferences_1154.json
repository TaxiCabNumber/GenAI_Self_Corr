At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPearl wants to order 5 monogrammed Christmas stockings for each of her 5 grandchildren and her own 4 children.  The stockings are $20.00 each and currently 10% off.  The monogramming will costs $5.00 per stocking.  How much will the stockings costs?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the stockings before the discount:\n5 stockings x $20.00 each = $100.00\n\n2. Calculate the discount:\n$100.00 x 0.10 = $10.00\n\n3. Subtract the discount from the total cost of the stockings:\n$100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the monogramming:\n5 stockings x $5.00 each = $25.00\n\n5. Add the cost of the stockings and the cost of the monogramming:\n$90.00 + $25.00 = $115.00\n\nSo, the total cost of the stockings will be $115.00.\nI hope it is correct: $115$",
