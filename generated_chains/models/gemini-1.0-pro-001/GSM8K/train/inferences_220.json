At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. Mr. Montero's car has 8 gallons in it. How many more gallons of gas does he need to travel 600 miles, back and forth?",
        "inference": "1. First, find the car's gas mileage. 400 miles / 20 gallons = 20 miles per gallon\n2. Then, find out how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs to travel 600 miles. 600 miles / 20 miles per gallon = 30 gallons\n3. Finally, subtract the number of gallons of gas Mr. Montero already has from the number of gallons of gas he needs. 30 gallons - 8 gallons = 22 gallons\nI hope it is correct: 22 gallons",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Montero is traveling a total distance of 600 miles + 600 miles = <<600+600=1200>>1200 miles.\nThere are 1200 miles / 400 miles = <<1200/400=3>>3 sets of 400 miles in 1200 miles.\nSo Mr. Montero needs 20 gallons/set x 3 sets = <<20*3=60>>60 gallons in all.\nSince his car has 8 gallons already, then he needs to add 60 gallons - 8 gallons = <<60-8=52>>52 gallons more.\n#### 52"
