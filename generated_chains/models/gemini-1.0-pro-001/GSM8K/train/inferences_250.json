At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom uses 10 weight plates each weighing 30 pounds on an exercise machine.  This exercise machine uses special technology to make the weights 20% heavier on the lowering portion.  How heavy did the weights feel when being lowered?",
        "inference": "1. Find the weight of all the plates before they are lowered:\n10 plates x 30 pounds per plate = 300 pounds\n\n2. Find the percentage of the weight that is added when the plates are lowered:\n20% of 300 pounds = 60 pounds\n\n3. Add the weight that is added to the original weight of the plates:\n300 pounds + 60 pounds = 360 pounds\n\nI hope it is correct: 360 pounds",
