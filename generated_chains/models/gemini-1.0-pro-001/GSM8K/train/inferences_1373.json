At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJose bought 20,000 square meters of land and needs to divide it equally with his four siblings. How much land, in the square meters, will Jose have after dividing it with his siblings?",
        "inference": " divide the total land area by the number of siblings to find the equal share for each person.\n\n**Step 1: Total land area**\n\nTotal land area = 20,000 square meters\n\n**Step 2: Number of siblings**\n\nNumber of siblings = 4\n\n**Step 3: Equal share for each sibling**\n\nEqual share = Total land area / Number of siblings\n\nEqual share = 20,000 square meters / 4\n\nEqual share = 5,000 square meters\n\n**Step 4: Jose's share after dividing the land**\n\nSince Jose is dividing the land equally with his siblings, he will also receive an equal share. Therefore, Jose's share will be the same as the equal share calculated above.\n\n**Jose's share = 5,000 square meters**\n\nI hope it is correct: Jose's share = 5,000 square meters",
        "ground_truth": "The land will be divided into 1 (Jose) + 4 siblings = <<1+4=5>>5 pieces.\nSo, Jose will have 20,000/5 = <<20000/5=4000>>4000 square meters of land.\n#### 4000"
