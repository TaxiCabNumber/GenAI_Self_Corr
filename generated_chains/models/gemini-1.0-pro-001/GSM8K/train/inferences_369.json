At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMonika went out for the day and spent some money. She went to the mall and spent $250. Then, she went to the movies and watched 3 movies back to back that each cost $24. Then she stopped by the farmer's market on her way home and got 20 bags of beans at $1.25/bag. How much money did Monika spend throughout her day?",
        "inference": "1. Monika spent $250 at the mall.\n2. She spent $24 on each of the 3 movies, so she spent a total of $24 x 3 = $72 on movies.\n3. She bought 20 bags of beans at $1.25 per bag, so she spent a total of $1.25 x 20 = $25 on beans.\n4. To find the total amount Monika spent, we add up the amounts she spent at each place: $250 + $72 + $25 = $347.\nI hope it is correct: $347",
