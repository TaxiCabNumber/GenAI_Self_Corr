At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt takes 15 mink skins to make a coat. Andy buys 30 minks and each mink has 6 babies, but half the total minks are set free by activists. How many coats can he make?",
        "inference": "Andy has 30 minks and each one gives birth to 6 babies. So the total number of minks is 30 + 30 * 6 = 210. Half of them are set free, so he is left with 210 / 2 = 105 minks. Each coat requires 15 mink skins, so the number of coats he can make is 105 / 15 = 7.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
