At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony has a terrible toothache and decides to buy some painkillers from the store.  He picks up a bottle of 50 pills and takes them home.  He takes 2 pills each day three times a day for the first 2 days, before cutting this amount in half for the next 3 days.  On the sixth day, he takes a final 2 pills in the morning and ends up feeling better.  How many pills are left in the bottle?",
