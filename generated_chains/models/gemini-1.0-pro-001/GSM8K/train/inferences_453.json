At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJillian, Savannah, and Clayton were collecting shells on the beach. Jillian collected 29, Savannah collected 17, and Clayton collected 8. They decided that they wanted to give the shells to two of their friends who had just arrived. They put their shells together and distributed them evenly to each friend. How many shells did each friend get?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n\n1. Add the number of shells each person collected to find the total number of shells: 29 + 17 + 8 = 54.\n\n2. Divide the total number of shells by the number of friends who will receive them to find the number of shells each friend will get: 54 / 2 = 27.\n\nI hope it is correct: 27",
        "ground_truth": "The kids collected 29 + 17 + 8 = <<29+17+8=54>>54 shells.\nIf they distribute the shells evenly between 2 friends, 54 / 2 = <<54/2=27>>27 shells for each friend.\n#### 27"
