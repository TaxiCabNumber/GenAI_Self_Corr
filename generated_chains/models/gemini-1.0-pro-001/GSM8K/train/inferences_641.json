At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlex makes luxury dresses out of silk. Each dress needs 5 meters of silk and Alex has 600 meters of silk in storage. His friends also want to learn how to make these dresses so Alex gives all 5 of them 20 meters of silk each. He uses the rest to make dresses himself. How many dresses can Alex make?",

        "ground_truth": "Alex gives his friends a total of 5 friends * 20 meters of silk = <<5*20=100>>100 meters of silk.\nThis means he has 600 \u2013 100 = <<600-100=500>>500 meters of silk left in storage.\nHe can therefore make 500 meters of silk / 5 meters of silk per dress = <<500/5=100>>100 dresses.\n#### 100"
