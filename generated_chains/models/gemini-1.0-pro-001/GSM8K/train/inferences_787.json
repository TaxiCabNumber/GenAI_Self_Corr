Eden carried 4 buckets of sand. Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden. Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary. If each bucket contains 2 pounds of sand, how many pounds of sand did they collect in total?",
        "inference": "* Eden carried 4 buckets of sand. So, the total sand collected by Eden is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.\n* Mary carried 3 more buckets of sand than Eden, i.e., 4 + 3 = 7 buckets. So, the total sand collected by Mary is 7 * 2 = 14 pounds.\n* Iris carried 1 less bucket of sand than Mary, i.e., 7 - 1 = 6 buckets. So, the total sand collected by Iris is 6 * 2 = 12 pounds.\n* Therefore, the total sand collected by them in total is 8 + 14 + 12 = 34 pounds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 34 pounds",
