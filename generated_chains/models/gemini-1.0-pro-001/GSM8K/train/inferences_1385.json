        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCole wants to fence his backyard on three sides. His backyard is 9 feet along the sides and 18 feet along the back. The neighbor behind him agreed to pay for half of their shared side of his fence, and the neighbor on his left agreed to pay for a third of their shared side. Fencing costs $3 per foot. How much does Cole have to pay for the fence?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the length of the shared side with the backyard neighbor. 18 feet / 2 = 9 feet\n2. Calculate the length of the shared side with the side neighbor. 18 feet / 3 = 6 feet\n3. Calculate the total cost of fencing. (9 feet + 18 feet + 6 feet) * $3 = $99\n4. Calculate the neighbor's contribution. 9 feet * $3 / 2 + 6 feet * $3 / 3 = $33\n5. Subtract the neighbor's contribution from the total cost. $99 - $33 = $66\nI hope it is correct: $66",
        "ground_truth": "Cole has to pay 3 * 9 = $<<3*9=27>>27 for one side of the side fence.\nFor the shared left fence, he has to pay two-thirds of 27, so he has to pay 27 * 2 / 3 = $<<27*2/3=18>>18.\nThe shared back fence will cost 3 * 18 = $<<3*18=54>>54.\nHe has to pay for half the back fence, so it will cost 54 / 2 = $<<54/2=27>>27.\nThus, Cole has to pay 18 + 27 + 27 = $<<18+27+27=72>>72 for the fence.\n#### 72"
