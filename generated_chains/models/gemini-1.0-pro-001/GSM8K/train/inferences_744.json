At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nYolanda leaves home for work at 7:00 AM, riding her bike at 20 miles per hour. 15 minutes after she leaves, her husband realizes that she forgot her lunch, and jumps in the car to bring it to her. If he drives at 40 miles per hour and follows the exact same route as Yolanda, how many minutes will it take him to catch her?",

That means Yolanda's distance is equal to 20 mph * (x + 15) and her husband's distance is equal to 40 mph * x\nYolanda's husband catches up to her when they've both traveled the same distance, which is when 20(x + 15) = 40x\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying 20 through the parentheses to get 20x + 300 = 40x\nThen we can subtract 20x from each side to get 300 = 20x\nFinally, we divide both sides by 20 to find that x = 15.\n#### 15"
