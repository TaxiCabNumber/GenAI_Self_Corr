At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCompared to the amount of water she drank, Carla drank three times as much soda minus 6 ounces. If she drank 54 ounces of liquid total, how much water did she drink?",
        "inference": "Let x be the amount of water Carla drank. We can write the amount of soda she drank as 3x-6. Since she drank 54 ounces total, we have: x + (3x-6) = 54. Solving for x, we get: 4x - 6 = 54. Adding 6 to both sides, we get: 4x = 60. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 15. I hope it is correct: 15",
        "ground_truth": "Let s be the amount of soda Carla drank and w be the amount of water she drank. We know that s + w = 54 and s = 3w - 6. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 3w - 6 + w = 54.\nCombining like terms, we get 4w - 6 = 54\nAdding 6 to both sides, we get 4w = 60\nDividing both sides by 4, we get w = 15\n#### 15"
