At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJason is mixing a batch of black paint. He needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. If he adds 900 ml of water, how much charcoal does he add?",
        "inference": "1. Set up a proportion: 2 grams of charcoal / 30 ml of water = x grams of charcoal / 900 ml of water\n2. Cross-multiply: 30 ml of water * x grams of charcoal = 2 grams of charcoal * 900 ml of water\n3. Solve for x: x grams of charcoal = (2 grams of charcoal * 900 ml of water) / 30 ml of water\n4. Simplify: x grams of charcoal = 60 grams of charcoal\nI hope it is correct: 60 grams",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many ml of water Jason needs for 1 gram of charcoal: 30 ml / 2 grams = <<30/2=15>>15 ml/g\nThen divide the amount of water Jason uses by the amount of water per gram of charcoal to find how much charcoal he uses: 900 ml / 15 ml/g = <<900/15=60>>60 g\n#### 60"
