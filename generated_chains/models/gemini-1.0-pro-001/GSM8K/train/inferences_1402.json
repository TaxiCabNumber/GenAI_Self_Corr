At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDan is digging graves for a family killed by COVID-19. If it takes Dan 3 hours to dig an adult grave and 2 hours to dig a child's grave, how long does it take him to dig 5 adult graves and one child's grave?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the time it takes to dig 5 adult graves: 5 graves * 3 hours/grave = 15 hours\n2. Calculate the time it takes to dig 1 child's grave: 1 grave * 2 hours/grave = 2 hours\n3. Add the time it takes to dig the adult graves and the child's grave: 15 hours + 2 hours = 17 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 17 hours",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total amount of time Dan spends digging adult graves: 3 hours/grave * 5 graves = <<3*5=15>>15 hours\nThen add the time to dig the child's grave to find the total time he spends digging: 15 hours + 2 hours = <<15+2=17>>17 hours\n#### 17"
