        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn her first term, Governor Sandoval gave twice as many commencement addresses as Governor Hawkins. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval in the same amount of time. If Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, how many commencement addresses did the three of them give altogether?",
        "inference": "1. Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses.\n2. Governor Hawkins gave half as many commencement addresses as Governor Sandoval, so he gave 12 / 2 = 6 commencement addresses.\n3. Governor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, so he gave 12 + 10 = 22 commencement addresses.\n4. The three of them gave 12 + 6 + 22 = 40 commencement addresses altogether.\nI hope it is correct: 40 commencement addresses$",
        "ground_truth": "Since Governor Sandoval gave 12 commencement addresses, twice the number that Governor Hawkins gave, Governor Hawkins gave 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 commencement addresses.\nThe two of them gave 6+12 = <<6+12=18>>18 commencement addresses in total.\nGovernor Sloan gave ten more commencement addresses than Governor Sandoval, a total of 12+10 = <<12+10=22>>22 commencement addresses.\nThe three of them gave 22+18 = <<22+18=40>>40 commencement addresses.\n#### 40"
