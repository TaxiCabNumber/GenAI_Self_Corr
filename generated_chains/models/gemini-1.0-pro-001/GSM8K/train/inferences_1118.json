At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPerry, Dana, Charlie, and Phil played golf together every week.  At the end of the season, Perry had won five more games than Dana, but Charlie had won 2 games fewer than Dana.  Phil had won 3 games more than Charlie did.  If Phil won a total of 12 games, how many more games did Perry win than did Phil?",
