At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?",
        "inference": "1. She got 68 gallons yesterday morning.\n2. She got 82 gallons yesterday evening.\n3. So, she got a total of 68 + 82 = 150 gallons yesterday.\n4. She got 18 gallons fewer than 68 gallons this morning.\n5. So, she got 68 - 18 = 50 gallons this morning.\n6. She sold some gallons of milk in the afternoon.\n7. So, she got a total of 150 + 50 - 24 = 176 gallons before she sold some gallons of milk in the afternoon.\n8. Each gallon costs $3.50.\n9. So, her revenue for the milk is 176 * $3.50 = $616.\n\nI hope it is correct: $616$",
        "ground_truth": "Mrs. Lim got 68 gallons - 18 gallons = <<68-18=50>>50 gallons this morning.\nSo she was able to get a total of 68 gallons + 82 gallons + 50 gallons = <<68+82+50=200>>200 gallons.\nShe was able to sell 200 gallons - 24 gallons = <<200-24=176>>176 gallons.\nThus, her total revenue for the milk is $3.50/gallon x 176 gallons = $<<3.50*176=616>>616.\n#### 616"
