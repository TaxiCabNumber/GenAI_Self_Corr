At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA sixty bulb watt uses 60 watts of power each day. If Allyn has 40 such bulbs in his house and pays an electricity bill of twenty cents per power watt used, calculate Allyn's total monthly expenses on electricity in June.",
