        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.  The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce but only 2 ounces.  He then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his 2 drinks combined.  How much caffeine did he consume?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the total caffeine in the energy drinks.\n- 12 ounces x 250 grams of caffeine per ounce = 3,000 grams of caffeine\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the caffeine in the second drink.\n- 2 ounces x 3 times more caffeinated per ounce = 6 ounces of caffeine\n\n**Step 3:** Add the caffeine from both energy drinks.\n- 3,000 grams + 6 ounces = 3,006 grams of caffeine\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the caffeine in the caffeine pill.\n- 3,006 grams x 2 = 6,012 grams of caffeine\n\n**Step 5:** Add the caffeine from all sources.\n- 3,006 grams + 6,012 grams = 9,018 grams of caffeine\n\nI hope it is correct: 9,018 grams",
        "ground_truth": "The second drink was 2/12=1/6 the size of the first drink\nSo it had 1/6*3=1/2 the caffeine\nThat means it had 1/2*250=<<250/2=125>>125 grams of caffeine\nSo the total amount of caffeine he drank was 125+250=<<125+250=375>>375 grams\nSo he consumed 375*2=<<375*2=750>>750 grams of caffeine for the day\n#### 750"
