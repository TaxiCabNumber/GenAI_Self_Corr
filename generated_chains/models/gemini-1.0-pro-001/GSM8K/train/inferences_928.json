At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a glee club, there are two times as many female than male members. How many female members are there if there are 18 members in the club?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the number of male members in the club is 'x'.\nAccording to the given information, the number of female members is twice the number of male members. So, the number of female members is 2x.\nGiven that there are 18 members in the club, we can write an equation:\nx + 2x = 18\n3x = 18\nx = 6\nTherefore, the number of male members in the club is 6.\nAnd, the number of female members in the club is 2x = 2(6) = 12.\n\nI hope it is correct: 12",
