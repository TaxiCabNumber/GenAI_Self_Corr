At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrian is a real estate agent. He makes a 2% commission on each sale. During June, he sold three houses. The houses sold for $157,000, $499,000, and $125,000. What was Brian\u2019s total commission on these three sales?",
