At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA small zoo houses a variety of 68 wild animals. After they send a gorilla family of six to a different zoo, they adopt a hippopotamus from another zoo. A while later, an animal rescue contacted them, and the zoo took in three endangered rhinos. Then one of their lionesses gave birth to cubs, and they opened a meerkat exhibit with twice as many meerkats as they had gained lion cubs. The zoo then had 90 animals in all. How many lion cubs were born at the zoo?",
        "inference": "They start with 68 animals\nSubtract 6 gorillas: 68 - 6 = 62\nAdd 1 hippopotamus: 62 + 1 = 63\nAdd 3 rhinos: 63 + 3 = 66\nAdd unknown lion cubs: 66 + x = 66 + x\nOpen meerkat exhibit: 66 + x + 2x = 66 + 3x\nEnd with 90 animals: 66 + 3x = 90\nSubtract 66 from both sides: 3x = 24\nDivide both sides by 3: x = 8\nThere were 8 lion cubs born at the zoo.\nI hope it is correct: 8",
        "ground_truth": "Let C be the number of lion cubs.\nThere are 2C meerkats in the new exhibit.\nThe zoo sent 4 gorillas away, so they had 68 - 6 = <<68-6=62>>62 animals left.\nThey adopted a hippopotamus, so they had 62 + 1 = <<62+1=63>>63 animals.\nThey took in 3 rhinos, so they had 63 + 3 = <<63+3=66>>66 animals.\nThus, they had 90 - 66 = <<90-66=24>>24 new lion cubs and meerkats.\nTherefore, they had C + 2C = 3C = 24 new lion cubs as meerkats.\nHence, there were C = 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 lion cubs born.\n#### 8"
