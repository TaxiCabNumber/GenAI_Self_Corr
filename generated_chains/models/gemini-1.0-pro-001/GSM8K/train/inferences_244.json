At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA fox can run at the maximum speed of 50 kilometers per hour. Considering the fox would run at a constant speed, what distance would he make during 120 minutes?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 120 minutes to hours: 120 minutes * (1 hour / 60 minutes) = 2 hours\n2. Multiply the fox's speed by the time: 50 kilometers/hour * 2 hours = 100 kilometers\nI hope it is correct: 100",
        "ground_truth": "1 hour is 60 minutes, so 120 minutes is 120 / 60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours.\nDuring one hour a fox can make 50 kilometers, so during two hours, he would be able to run 50 * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 kilometers.\n#### 100"
