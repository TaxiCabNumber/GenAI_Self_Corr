At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJane plans on reading a novel she borrows from her friend. She reads twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. In the morning she reads 5 pages and in the evening she reads 10 pages. If she reads at this rate for a week, how many pages will she read?",
