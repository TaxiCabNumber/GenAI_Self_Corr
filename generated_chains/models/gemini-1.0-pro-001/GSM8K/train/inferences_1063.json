At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNina made a two-layer cake and a dozen cupcakes for her friend\u2019s birthday party. Each layer of cake takes the same amount of sugar to make as a dozen cupcakes. Nina used 720 grams of sugar to bake everything. How many grams of sugar are in one cupcake?",

        "ground_truth": "Nina made 2 cake layers which were equal to 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes.\nShe made the equivalent of 24 + 12 = <<24+12=36>>36 cupcakes in all.\nThus, there are 720 / 36 = <<720/36=20>>20 grams of sugar in a cupcake.\n#### 20"
