At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA publishing house decides to create a contest for new writers and will award a total of $800 in prizes to the 18 novels with the most votes. First place will get $200, second place will get $150, third place $120 and the rest of the awards will be paid with the same amount of money. How much money will each writer earn from fourth place onwards?",
