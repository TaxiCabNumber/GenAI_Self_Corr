The second dog eats twice as much while the third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog. How many cups of dog food should Hannah prepare in a day for her three dogs?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- The first dog eats 1.5 cups of dog food a day.\n- The second dog eats twice as much. So, the second dog eats $1.5 \\times 2 = 3$ cups of dog food a day.\n- The third dog eats 2.5 cups more than the second dog. So, the third dog eats $3 + 2.5 = 5.5$ cups of dog food a day.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of cups of dog food Hannah should prepare in a day for her three dogs is $1.5 + 3 + 5.5 = \\boxed{10}$.\nI hope it is correct: 10",
