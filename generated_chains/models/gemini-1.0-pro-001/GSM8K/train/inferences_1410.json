At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrittney can chop 15 onions in 5 minutes. Carl can chop 20 onions within that same time. How many more onions can Carl chop in 30 minutes than Brittney?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* 1. Calculate the rate at which Brittney chops onions.\n        * Brittney can chop 15 onions in 5 minutes, so her rate is 15 onions / 5 minutes = 3 onions per minute.\n   \n* 2. Calculate the rate at which Carl chops onions.\n         * Carl can chop 20 onions in 5 minutes, so his rate is 20 onions / 5 minutes = 4 onions per minute.\n\n* 3. Calculate the total number of onions Brittney can chop in 30 minutes.\n        * Brittney can chop 3 onions per minute, so in 30 minutes she can chop 3 onions/ min * 30 minutes = 90 onions.\n\n* 4. Calculate the total number of onions Carl can chop in 30 minutes.\n        * Carl can chop 4 onions per minute, so in 30 minutes he can chop 4 onions/ min * 30 minutes = 120 onions.\n\n* 5. Calculate the difference between the number of onions Brittney can chop and the number of onions Carl can chop in 30 minutes.\n        * Carl can chop 120 onions in 30 minutes, while Brittney can chop 90 onions, so the difference is 120 onions - 90 onions = 30 onions.\n\nI hope it is correct: $30$",
