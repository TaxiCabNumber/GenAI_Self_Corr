At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?",
        "inference": "1. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon has blown up. So, the number of balloons that have blown up after half an hour = (1/5) * 200 = 40 balloons.\n2. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. So, the number of balloons that have blown up after one hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.\n3. Therefore, the number of balloons in the hot air balloon that remain intact = 200 - 80 = 120 balloons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 120",
        "ground_truth": "After half an hour, the number of balloons that had blown up is 1/5*200 = <<1/5*200=40>>40\nThe number of balloons that haven't blown up so far is 200-40 = <<200-40=160>>160\nIn the next hour, 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 balloons blow up.\nThe number of balloons that haven't blown up now is 160-80 = <<160-80=80>>80\n#### 80"
