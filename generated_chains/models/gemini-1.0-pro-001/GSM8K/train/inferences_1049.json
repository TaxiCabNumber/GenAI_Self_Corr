At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a math test, Mark scored twice as much as the least score. If the highest score is 98 and the range of the scores is 75, what was Mark's score?",
        "inference": "1. Let's represent the lowest score with \"x\".\n2. According to the given information, Mark's score is twice the lowest score, so Mark's score can be represented as \"2x\".\n3. The range of the scores is 75, which means the difference between the highest and lowest scores is 75. So, we have the equation: 98 - x = 75.\n4. Solving the equation for \"x\", we get: x = 23.\n5.
