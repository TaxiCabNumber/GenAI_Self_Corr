At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEvery hour past noon shadows from a building stretch an extra 5 feet, starting at zero at noon.  How long are the shadows from the building 6 hours past noon in inches?",
        "inference": "1. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 5 feet are added to the length of the shadow each hour.\n2. Thus, the length of the shadow increases by 5 feet/60 minutes = 1/12 feet per minute.\n3. In 6 hours, there are 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.\n4. The length of the shadow after 6 hours is thus 0 feet + (1/12 feet/minute) * 360 minutes = 30 feet.\n5. 1 feet = 12 inches.\n6. The length of the shadow after 6 hours in inches is thus 30 feet * 12 inches/feet = 360 inches.\nI hope it is correct: 360",
        "ground_truth": "If the shadows lengthen by 5 feet per hour, this means that in 6 hours the shadows would have lengthened from zero to 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 feet.\nSince there are 12 inches in every foot, this means the building's shadow would be 30*12= <<30*12=360>>360 inches in length.\n#### 360"
