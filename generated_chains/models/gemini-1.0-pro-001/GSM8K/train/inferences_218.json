        "inference": "1. Ravi has 6 nickels.\n2. He has 2 more quarters than nickels, so he has 6 + 2 = 8 quarters.\n3. He has 4 more dimes than quarters, so he has 8 + 4 = 12 dimes.\n4. The value of 6 nickels is 6 * 5 = 30 cents.\n5. The value of 8 quarters is 8 * 25 = 200 cents.\n6. The value of 12 dimes is 12 * 10 = 120 cents.\n7.
