If the total amount of food she had prepared for lunch had 40 calories, and the recommended calorie intake by the FDA is 25, how many more calories than the recommended amount did she eat?",

Calculate the difference between the amount of food she ate and the recommended calorie intake: 30 calories - 25 calories = 5 calories\n3.
