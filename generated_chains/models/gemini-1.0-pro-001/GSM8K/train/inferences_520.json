At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 25 different layers of rock in a canyon\u2019s strata. Five of the layers are limestone. Half of the rest are sandstone. Four of the remaining are quartz. Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\u2019s strata?",
