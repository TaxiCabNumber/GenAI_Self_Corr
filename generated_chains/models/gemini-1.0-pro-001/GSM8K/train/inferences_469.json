At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJackson wants to impress his girlfriend by filling her hot tub with champagne. The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne?",
        "inference": "1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts.\nTherefore, a 40-gallon hot tub can hold 40 * 4 = 160 quarts of champagne.\nA 20% volume discount means that Jackson will get a discount of 20% on the volume of champagne that he buys.\nSo, the volume of champagne that he will get after the discount is 160 quarts * (1 - 20/100) = 128 quarts.\nEach bottle of champagne holds 1 quart.\nSo, he needs to buy 128 quarts / 1 quart per bottle = 128 bottles of champagne.\nEach bottle of champagne costs $50.\nSo, he will spend 128 bottles * $50 per bottle = $6400 on champagne.\nI hope it is correct: $6400$",
        "ground_truth": "First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=160>>160 quarts\nThen multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50/quart = $<<160*50=8000>>8000\nThen multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * .2 = $<<8000*.2=1600>>1600\nFinally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $<<8000-1600=6400>>6400\n#### 6400"
