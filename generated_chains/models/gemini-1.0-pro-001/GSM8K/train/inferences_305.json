At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTommy wants to earn enough money to buy 8 new books. Each book costs $5. If Tommy already has $13, how much does he need to save up?",
        "inference": "First, I need to find the total amount of money Tommy needs to buy 8 new books. To do this, I can multiply the cost of each book ($5) by the number of books Tommy wants to buy (8). This will give me $5 x 8 = $40.\n\nNext, I need to subtract the amount of money Tommy already has ($13) from the total amount he needs to buy the books ($40). This will give me $40 - $13 = $27.\n\nTherefore, Tommy needs to save up $27 to buy 8 new books.\n\nI hope it is correct: $27",
