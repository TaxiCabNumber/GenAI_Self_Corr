It increased its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.  He is able to sell the cow for $3 per pound.  How much more is it worth after gaining the weight?",

Find the difference between the new weight and the original weight.\n600.00 pounds - 400.00 pounds = 200.00 pounds\n\n4. Multiply the difference in weight by the price of the cow to find out how much it increased in value.\n200.00 pounds * $3 = $600.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $600.00",
        "ground_truth": "The cow initially weighs 400*1.5=<<400*1.5=600>>600 pounds\nSo it gained 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 pounds\nSo its value increased by 200*$3 = $<<200*3=600>>600\n#### 600"
