At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDavid swims the 100-meter freestyle in 48 seconds.  He swims the 100-meter backstroke 4 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter freestyle, he swims the 100-meter butterfly 3 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter backstroke, and he swims the 100-meter breaststroke 2 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter butterfly.  What is the combined length of time, in seconds, it would take for him to swim all four 100-meter events (the freestyle, the backstroke, the butterfly, and the breaststroke)?",

He swims the 100-meter backstroke 4 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter freestyle, so he swims the backstroke in 48 + 4 = 52 seconds.\n3. He swims the 100-meter butterfly 3 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter backstroke, so he swims the butterfly in 52 + 3 = 55 seconds.\n4. He swims the 100-meter breaststroke 2 seconds slower than he swims the 100-meter butterfly, so he swims the breaststroke in 55 + 2 = 57 seconds.\n5. The combined length of time, in seconds, it would take for him to swim all four 100-meter events is 48 + 52 + 55 + 57 = 212 seconds.\n\nI hope it is correct: 212 $seconds$",
