At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\n4 friends went to buy from a clothes shop. Every item was 50% off.  All four friends decided to buy a t-shirt. The original price of the t-shirt was 20 dollars. How much money did they spend in total?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Calculate the discount per t-shirt. 50% off means a discount of 50% of the original price, which is 0.5 times 20 dollars, or 10 dollars.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the discounted price per t-shirt. The discounted price is the original price minus the discount, which is 20 dollars minus 10 dollars, or 10 dollars.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total amount spent. Since there were four friends, and each friend bought a t-shirt, the total amount spent is the discounted price per t-shirt multiplied by the number of friends, which is 10 dollars times 4, or 40 dollars.\n\nI hope it is correct: $40$",
        "ground_truth": "After the 50% discount, the t-shirt cost 20 * 0.5 = $<<20*0.5=10>>10.\nSo in all, the 4 friends spent 4 * $10 = $<<4*10=40>>40.\n#### 40"
