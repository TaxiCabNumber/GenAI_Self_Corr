At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?",
        "inference": "1. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. So the second tank is 48 / 2 = 24 gallons.\n2. Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. So she can keep 24 two-inch fish in the second tank.\n3. She keeps three-inch fish in the first tank. So she can keep 48 / 3 = 16 three-inch fish in the first tank.\n4. If one of the first tank fish eats another, she will have 15 three-inch fish in the first tank.\n5. So she will have 15 - 24 = -9 more fish in the first tank than the second tank.\n\nI hope it is correct: -9 $fish$",
        "ground_truth": "The second tank is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 gallons.\nFollowing her rule, Gail keeps 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 two-inch fish in the second tank.\nShe keeps 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 fish in the first tank.\nIf one fish in the first tank ate another, she would have 16 - 1 = <<16-1=15>>15 fish in the first tank.\nThus, Gail would have 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 more fish in the first tank.\n#### 3"
