At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony wants to build the longest rope he possibly can, so he collects all the rope in his home. He finds an 8-foot rope, a 20-foot rope, three 2 foot ropes, and a 7-foot rope. each knot between the ropes makes him lose 1.2 foot per knot. How long is his rope when he's done tying them all together?",
        "inference": "1. Add up the length of all the ropes: 8 + 20 + 3(2) + 7 = 43 feet\n2. Subtract the total length lost due to knots: 43 - (4 - 1) * 1.2 = 37.2 feet\nI hope it is correct: 37.2",
        "ground_truth": "The combined length of all the rope is 41 feet because 8 + 20 + (2 x 3) + 7 = <<8+20+(2*3)+7=41>>41\nHe loses 6 feet from the knots because 5 x 1.2 = <<5*1.2=6>>6\nThe final length is 35 feet because 41 - 6 = <<41-6=35>>35\n#### 35"
