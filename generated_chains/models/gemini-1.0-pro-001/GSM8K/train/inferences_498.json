At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 6 people going on an airplane trip.  They each have 5 bags of luggage.  Each of their bags weighs the maximum weight allowed, 50 pounds.  The airplane can hold a total luggage weight of 6000 pounds.  How many more bags at maximum weight can the plane hold?",
