At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNurse Missy is attending to the needs of 12 patients in her hospital ward.  Most of her patients require standard care, but one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements, which increases the serving time by 20%.  At dinner time, she brings each patient their meal. It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.  How long does it take, in minutes, for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients?",
        "inference": "1. She has 12 patients total.\n2. One-third of 12 is 4.\n3. So, 4 patients have special dietary requirements and 8 patients do not.\n4. It takes her 5 minutes to serve each patient with standard care.\n5. It takes her 1.2*5 = 6 minutes to serve each patient with special dietary requirement.\n6. (4*6) + (8*5) = 24 + 40 = 64 minutes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 64",
        "ground_truth": "Nurse Missy has 12*(1/3)=<<12*(1/3)=4>>4 special needs patients.\nShe has 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 standard care patients.\nSpecial needs patients take 20% longer to serve, which means serving takes 1.2*5=6 minutes per patient.\nTo serve dinner to all of her standard care patients, it will take 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 minutes.\nTo serve dinner to all of her special needs patients, it will take 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 minutes.\nIn total, it will take 40+24=<<40+24=64>>64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.\n#### 64"
