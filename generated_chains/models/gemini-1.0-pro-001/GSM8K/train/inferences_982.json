So, the total number of cookies Frank bakes = 12 \u00d7 12 = 144 cookies.\n3. Frank eats one cookie each day for 6 days. So, the total number of cookies Frank eats = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6 cookies.\n4. Ted comes over on the sixth day and eats 4 cookies. So, the total number of cookies Ted eats = 4 cookies.\n5.
