At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHarry wants to build a homemade helium balloon with his son, Kevin, so he and Kevin go to the store with $200. They buy a giant sheet to turn into a balloon for $42, a rope for $18, and a propane tank and burner for $14. They plan to use the rest of the money on helium. The helium is $1.50 per ounce. For every ounce they buy, the balloon can fly 113 feet higher. How many feet up can they fly the balloon?",
        "inference": "The total amount Harry and Kevin can spend on helium is $200 - $42 - $18 - $14 = $126.\n\nAt $1.50 per ounce, they can buy 126 / 1.50 = 84 ounces of helium.\n\nSince each ounce of helium allows the balloon to fly 113 feet higher, 84 ounces of helium will allow the balloon to fly\n84 * 113 = 9552 feet higher.\n\nI hope it is correct: 9552",
        "ground_truth": "They have $126 for helium because 200 - 42 - 18 - 14 = <<200-42-18-14=126>>126.\nThey can buy 84 ounces of helium because 126 / 1.5 = <<126/1.5=84>>84\nThey can fly 9,492 feet up because 84 x 113 = <<84*113=9492>>9,492\n#### 9,492"
