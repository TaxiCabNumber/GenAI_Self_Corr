At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarla can cook a batch of waffles in 10 minutes and chicken-fried steak in 6 minutes. How long will it take her to cook 3 steaks and a batch of waffles?",

        "ground_truth": "First find the total cook time for the steaks: 3 steaks * 6 minutes/steak = <<3*6=18>>18 minutes\nThen add the waffles' cook time to find the total cook time: 18 minutes + 10 minutes = <<18+10=28>>28 minutes\n#### 28"
