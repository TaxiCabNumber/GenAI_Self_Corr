At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMason is cleaning out all the junk in his attic. 20% of the items are useful, 10% are valuable heirlooms, and 70% are junk. If Marcus's attic has 8 useful items in it, how many junk items does it have?",

Let the total number of items be x. \nSo, the number of useful items = (1/5)x, the number of valuable heirlooms = (1/10)x, and the number of junk items = (7/10)x.\n\n3. We know that the number of useful items is 8. So, (1/5)x = 8.\n\n4. Solve for x: x = 8 * 5 = 40.\n\n5. Therefore, the total number of items in Marcus's attic is 40.\n\n6. The number of junk items = (7/10)x = (7/10) * 40 = 28.\n\nI hope it is correct: $answer$ 28",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total number of items in the attic by dividing the number of useful items by the percentage of useful items: 8 items / .2 = <<8/.2=40>>40 items\nThen multiply the total number of items by the percentage that are junk to find the number of junk items: 40 items * .7 = <<40*.7=28>>28 items\n#### 28"
