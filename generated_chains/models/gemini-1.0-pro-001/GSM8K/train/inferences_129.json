At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDan owns an ice cream shop and every sixth customer gets a free ice cream cone. Cones cost $2 each. If he sold $100 worth of cones, how many free ones did he give away?",

Every sixth customer gets a free cone, so I need to divide the number of customers by 6 to find how many free cones were given: 50 / 6 = 8.3333...\n\n3. I can't give away a fraction of a cone, so I round down to the nearest whole number, which is 8.\n\nI hope it is correct: 8",
