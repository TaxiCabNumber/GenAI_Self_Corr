Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets and received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. How much did Mr. Benson pay in all?",
        "inference": "-He bought 12 tickets that each cost him $40. The total cost of the tickets is $40 * 12 = $480\n-He received a 5% discount for every ticket bought that exceeds 10. So, he received a 5% discount on 2 tickets. The discount for 2 tickets is $40 * 2 * 5% = $4.\n-Therefore, he paid $480 - $4 = $476 for all 12 tickets.\nI hope it is correct: 476",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Benson had a 5% discount for each of the 12 - 10 = <<12-10=2>>2 tickets.\nSo, those two tickets had a $40 x 5/100 = $<<40*5/100=2>>2 discount each.\nHence, each ticket cost $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 each.\nThus, two discounted tickets amount to $38 x 2 = $<<38*2=76>>76.\nAnd the other ten tickets amount to $40 x 10 = $<<40*10=400>>400.\nHence, Mr. Benson paid a total of $400 + $76 = $<<400+76=476>>476.\n#### 476"
