At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has.  If there are 52 Oreos total, how many does James have?",
        "inference": "Let's work through this problem step-by-step:\n\n1.  Let's define the number of Oreos Jordan has as \"j\".\n\n2.  According to the problem, James has 7 more than 4 times the number of Oreos Jordan has. So, James has \"4j + 7\" Oreos.\n\n3.  We know that the total number of Oreos is 52. So, we can write an equation:\n\n> \"4j + 7 + j = 52\"\n\n4.  Combining like terms, we get:\n\n> \"5j + 7 = 52\"\n\n5.  Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:\n\n> \"5j = 45\"\n\n6.  Dividing both sides by 5, we get:\n\n> \"j = 9\"\n\n7.  This means that Jordan has 9 Oreos.\n\n8.  Substituting this value of j back into our equation for James' Oreos, we get:\n\n> \"4j + 7 = 4(9) + 7 = 36 + 7 = 43\"\n\nI hope it is correct: James has 43 Oreos.",
