        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nYou can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of fruits in each category. Since you bought 36 fruits, and they are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons, there are 12 oranges, 12 apples, and 12 watermelons.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost of the oranges. Since each orange costs $0.50, the total cost of 12 oranges is 12 x $0.50 = $6.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the cost of the oranges from the total bill to find the cost of the apples and watermelons. $66 - $6 = $60.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the number of apples and watermelons combined. Since there are 12 oranges, the remaining 24 fruits are apples and watermelons combined.\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the total cost of the apples and watermelons. Since you can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price, the total cost of 24 apples and watermelons must be $60 / 2 = $30.\n\n**Step 6:** Determine the number of apples. Since there are 12 apples and 12 watermelons, half of the total cost of $30 is the cost of the apples.\n\n**Step 7:** Calculate the cost of 1 apple. Divide the cost of the apples ($30 / 2) by the number of apples (12) to get the cost of 1 apple.\n\n**Step 8:** Final Answer. $30 / 2 / 12 = $ 1.25. I hope it is correct: $1.25$",
