At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA farmer owns a hog that recently gave birth to 6 piglets.  If the farmer raises the piglets until they are fully grown, he can sell the fully grown pig for $300.  Each piglet must grow for at least 12 months before it is large enough to be sold. It costs the farmer $10 per month to feed each animal until it is sold.  If the farmer sells 3 pigs after 12 months, and the remaining 3 pigs after 16 months, how much profit did he earn in total (after deducting the cost of food)?",
        "inference": "First find the total revenue from selling the pigs. \nSince 3 pigs are sold after 12 months, that's $3 * $300= $900.\nSince 3 pigs are sold after 16 months, that's $3 * $300= $900.\nSo total revenue= $900+ $900= $1800.\n\nNow, find the total cost of feeding the pigs. \nSince each pig is fed for 12 months, it costs $10 per month, so the total cost of feeding 3 pigs for 12 months is $3 * $10 * $12= $360.\nSince each pig is fed for 16 months, it costs $10 per month, so the total cost of feeding 3 pigs for 16 months is $3 * $10 * $16= $480.\nSo total feeding cost= $360+ $480= $840.\n\nFinally, find the profit by subtracting the total feeding cost from the total revenue.\nProfit= $1800-$840= $960.\n\nI hope it is correct: $960",
        "ground_truth": "The 3 pigs that are sold after 12 months will cost the farmer 12*10*3 = $<<12*10*3=360>>360 in food costs.\nThe 3 pigs that are sold after 16 months will cost the farmer 16*10*3 = $<<16*10*3=480>>480 in food costs.\nThus, the total food cost to raise the 6 piglets was 360 + 480 = $<<360+480=840>>840.\nNext, selling the 6 fully grown pigs will earn the farmer 6*300 = $<<6*300=1800>>1800 in revenue.\nTherefore, the earn the farmer 1800 - 840 = $<<1800-840=960>>960 in profit from these sales.\n#### 960"
