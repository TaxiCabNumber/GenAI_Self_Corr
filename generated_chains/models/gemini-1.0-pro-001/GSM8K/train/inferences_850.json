At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nViviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, while Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana. If Viviana has 20 Vanilla chips and Susana 25 chocolate chips, calculate the total number of chips they have together.",
        "inference": "Let V be the number of chocolate chips that Viviana has. Then Susana has V - 5 chocolate chips.\n\nLet V also be the number of vanilla chips that Viviana has. Then Susana has 3/4 * V vanilla chips.\n\nWe know that Viviana has 20 vanilla chips, so V = 20.\n\nWe also know that Susana has 25 chocolate chips, so V - 5 = 25. Solving for V, we get V = 30.\n\nTherefore, Viviana has 30 chocolate chips and 20 vanilla chips, for a total of 50 chips. Susana has 25 chocolate chips and 3/4 * 20 = 15 vanilla chips, for a total of 40 chips. Together, they have 50 + 40 = 90 chips.\nI hope it is correct: Total number of chips: 90",
