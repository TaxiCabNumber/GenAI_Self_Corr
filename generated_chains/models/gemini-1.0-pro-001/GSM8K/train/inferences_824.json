At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA school has 15 classrooms. One-third of these classrooms have 30 desks in each classroom and the rest have 25 desks in each classroom. Only one student can sit at one desk. How many students can this school accommodate so that everyone has their own desk?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of classrooms with 30 desks: 15 classrooms * 1/3 = 5 classrooms.\n2. Calculate the number of classrooms with 25 desks: 15 classrooms - 5 classrooms = 10 classrooms.\n3. Calculate the number of desks in the classrooms with 30 desks: 5 classrooms * 30 desks/classroom = 150 desks.\n4. Calculate the number of desks in the classrooms with 25 desks: 10 classrooms * 25 desks/classroom = 250 desks.\n5. Calculate the total number of desks in the school: 150 desks + 250 desks = 400 desks.\n6. Since each student needs their own desk, the school can accommodate 400 students.\n\nI hope it is correct: 400",
        "ground_truth": "One-third of the classrooms have 30 desks, so there are 1/3 * 15 = <<1/3*15=5>>5 classrooms like that.\nThe rest, which means 15 - 5 = <<15-5=10>>10 classrooms, have 25 desks.\nOne-third of the classrooms can fit 5 * 30 = <<5*30=150>>150 students.\nThe rest can fit 10 * 25 = <<10*25=250>>250 students.\nSo in total, the school can be filled with 150 + 250 = <<150+250=400>>400 students.\n#### 400"
