His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie.  Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza.  Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza.  How many total slices were left over?",

Sammy ate 1/3 of the 12 slices from the cheese pizza: 12/3 = 4 slices.\n4. Total slices eaten: 6 slices (Dean) + 3 slices (Frank) + 4 slices (Sammy) = 13 slices.\n5.
