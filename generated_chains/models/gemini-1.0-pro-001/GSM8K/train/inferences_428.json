At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA frog lays her eggs over a series of 4 days.  The first day she lays 50 eggs.  The second day, she doubles her production of eggs.  The third day she lays 20 more than the second day, and the last day she doubles the first three days total.  How many eggs did the frog lay over the span of the 4 days?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n- **Day 1:** 50 eggs\n\n- **Day 2:** Double the production of Day 1, so 50 * 2 = 100 eggs\n\n- **Day 3:** Lay 20 more than Day 2, so 100 + 20 = 120 eggs\n\n- **Day 4:** Double the total of the first three days, so (50 + 100 + 120) * 2 = 540 eggs\n\n**Total eggs laid:** 50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810 eggs\n\nI hope it is correct: 810",
        "ground_truth": "Day 1:50\nDay 2:50(2)=100\nDay 3:100+20=<<100+20=120>>120\nDay 4:2(50+100+120)=540\nTotal:50+100+120+540=<<50+100+120+540=810>>810 eggs\n#### 810"
