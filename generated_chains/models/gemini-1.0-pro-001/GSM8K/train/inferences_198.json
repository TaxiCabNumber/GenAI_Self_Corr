At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRosie runs 6 miles per hour. She runs for 1 hour on Monday, 30 minutes on Tuesday, 1 hour on Wednesday, and 20 minutes on Thursday. If she wants to run 20 miles for the week, how many minutes should she run on Friday?",
        "inference": "Rosie runs 6 miles per hour. So, in 1 hour, she runs 6 miles. In 30 minutes (or 1/2 hour), she runs 6/2 = 3 miles. In 1 hour, she runs 6 miles. In 20 minutes (or 1/3 hour), she runs 6/3 = 2 miles. Rosie has already run 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 miles. To reach her goal of 20 miles, she needs to run 20 - 17 = 3 more miles. At her rate of 6 miles per hour, she needs to run 3/6 = 1/2 hour, or 30 minutes, on Friday.\nI hope it is correct: 30",
