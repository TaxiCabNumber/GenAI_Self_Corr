At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTony is driving his car between his town and a friend's down. The towns are 120 miles apart and he gets there in 3 hours. The next day, he is driving to see another friend who lives 200 miles away from his friend. If he drives at the same speed, how long will the drive take?",
        "inference": "The drive to the 2nd friend will take 3 hours + 1 hour (200 miles - 120 miles / 80 miles per hour) = 4 hours\nI hope it is correct: 4",
        "ground_truth": "He is driving 40 MPH because 120 / 3 = <<120/3=40>>40\nIt will take him 5 hours because 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5\n#### 5"
