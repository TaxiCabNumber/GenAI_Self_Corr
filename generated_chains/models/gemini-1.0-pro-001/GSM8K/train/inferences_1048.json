At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?",

(300 + 100 = 400)\n- We now know that the first three neighborhoods use a combined 150 + 300 + 400 = 850 barrels of water in a week.\n- We also know that the water tower holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week.\n- We can now subtract the amount of water used by the first three neighborhoods from the total amount of water in the tower to find out how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood.
