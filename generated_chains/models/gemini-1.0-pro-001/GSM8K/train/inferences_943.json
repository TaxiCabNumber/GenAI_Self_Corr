He buys each dozen donuts for $2.40 and then sells each donut for $1. How many dozen donuts does he need to buy and sell to reach his goal?",
        "inference": "Javier wants to raise $96, and he sells each donut for $1. So, the number of donuts (n) he needs to sell is $96/1 = 96$. \n\nHe buys each dozen donuts for $2.40, and he needs to buy n/12 dozens of donuts. So, the total cost (c) of buying the donuts is $2.40 * n/12 = $2 * n/5$. \n\nHe wants to make a profit of $96, so the profit (p) is $96. \n\nThe selling price (sp) of the donuts is $1 * n = n. \n\nTherefore, the profit (p) is equal to the selling price (sp) minus the cost (c): $p = sp - c$. \n\nSubstituting the values of p, sp, and c, we get $96 = n - $2 * n/5$. \n\nSolving for n, we get $n = 120$. \n\nTherefore, Javier needs to buy and sell 10 dozen donuts to reach his goal. \n\nI hope it is correct: 10",
        "ground_truth": "Every donut costs him $.2 because 2.4 divided by 12 equals <<2.4/12=.2>>.2\nSo he makes $.8 for every donut he sells because $1 minus $.2 equals .8\nHe needs to sell 120 donuts because 96 divided by .8 equals <<96/.8=120>>120.\nHe needs to buy and sell 10 dozen donuts because 120 divided by 12 equals <<120/12=10>>10\n#### 10"
