Each stick of gum cost half as much as the candy bar.  If the candy bar cost $1.5 each, how much did he pay in total?",

If he bought 2 packs, the total number of pieces of gum is 2 x 4 = 8.\nTotal cost of 8 pieces of gum = $0.75 x 8 = $6\n\n3. **Total cost of 3 candy bars:**\nIf each candy bar costs $1.5, the cost of 3 candy bars is 3 x $1.5 = $4.50\n\n4. **Total money spent by John:**\nTotal cost = Cost of gum + Cost of candy bars = $6 + $4.50 = $10.50\n\nI hope it is correct: $10.50$",
        "ground_truth": "The gum cost $1.5/2=$<<1.5/2=.75>>.75 per pack\nSo he pays $.75*2=$<<.75*2=1.5>>1.5 for the gum\nHe pays $1.5*3=$<<1.5*3=4.5>>4.5 for the candy bars\nSo in total, he pays $1.5 + $4.5 = $<<1.5+4.5=6>>6\n#### 6"
