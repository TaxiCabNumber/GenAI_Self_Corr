At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelissa wants to make some dresses to sell at the upcoming festival. She has 56 square meters of fabric to make them. She knows that each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric and 3 hours to make. How many hours does she have to work?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate how many dresses Melissa can make with 56 square meters of fabric.\n56 square meters / 4 square meters per dress = 14 dresses\n\n2. Calculate how many hours it will take to make 14 dresses.\n14 dresses * 3 hours per dress = 42 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 42",
        "ground_truth": "Each dress takes 4 square meters of fabric to make, so the number of dresses she can make will be 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 dresses.\nEach dress takes 3 hours to make, thus she will have to work 14 dresses x 3 hours/dress = <<14*3=42>>42 hours.\n#### 42"
