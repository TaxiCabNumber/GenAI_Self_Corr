He loses 60% of them into the street. Of the remaining ones, he loses half down a sewer. If he has 20 left, how many did he start with?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Archie lost 60% of his marbles into the street. So, he has 40% of his marbles remaining.\n**Step 2:** Of the remaining marbles, he lost half down a sewer. So, he has half of the remaining marbles, which is 20% of his original marbles.\n**Step 3:** He has 20 marbles left, which is 20% of his original marbles. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n```\n0.20x = 20\n```\n\nwhere x is the number of marbles Archie started with.\n\n**Step 4:** Solving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 20 / 0.20\nx = 100\n```\n\n**Therefore, Archie started with 100 marbles.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 100",
        "ground_truth": "He had 40 before losing them into the sewer because 20 x 2 =<<40=40>>40\nHe started with 100 because 40/.4=<<100=100>>100\n#### 100"
