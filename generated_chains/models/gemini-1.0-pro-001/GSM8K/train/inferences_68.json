At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe ratio of coins that Elsa has to that which Amalie has is 10:45. If the total number of coins they have is 440, and Amalie spends 3/4 of what she has on toys, how many will she remain with?",

Since the total number of coins is 440, we can write the equation:\n\n```\n10x + 45x = 440\n```\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 8\n```\n\nTherefore, Elsa has 10 * 8 = 80 coins, and Amalie has 45 * 8 = 360 coins.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of coins Amalie spends on toys**\n\nAmalie spends 3/4 of her coins on toys, so she spends:\n\n```\n3/4 * 360 = 270 coins\n```\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of coins Amalie remains with**\n\nAfter spending 270 coins, Amalie remains with:\n\n```\n360 - 270 = **90 coins**\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: 90",
