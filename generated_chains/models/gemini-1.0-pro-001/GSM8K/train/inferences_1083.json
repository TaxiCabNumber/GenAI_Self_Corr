At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA factory produced televisions at a constant rate of 10 per day in a certain year. If they reduced the total production by 10 percent in the second year, calculate the total production of television by the factory in the second year.",
