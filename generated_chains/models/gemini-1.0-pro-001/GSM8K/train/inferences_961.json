        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohnny TV makes 25 percent more movies than L&J Productions each year. If  L&J Productions produces 220 movies in a year, how many movies does the two production companies produce in five years combined?",
        "inference": "- Initially, we need to calculate Johnny TV's production rate as a percentage of L&J Productions' rate. According to the given information, Johnny TV makes 25% more movies than L&J Productions, so their production rate is 125% of L&J Productions' rate.\n- To determine Johnny TV's actual production rate, we need to multiply L&J Productions' production rate by 125%. Therefore, Johnny TV's production rate = 125% * L&J Productions' production rate = 1.25 * L&J Productions' production rate.\n- Now, we can calculate the total number of movies produced by both companies in a year. Let's assume that L&J Productions' production rate in a year is \"x\" movies. In that case, Johnny TV's production rate in a year would be 1.25 * x movies.\n- Therefore, the total number of movies produced by both companies in a year is equal to their combined production rates, which is x + 1.25 * x = 2.25 * x movies.\n- Finally, we need to determine the total number of movies produced by the two companies combined over five years. To do this, we simply multiply the total number of movies produced in a year by the number of years, which is 2.25 * x * 5 = 11.25 * x movies.\n- Since L&J Productions produced 220 movies in a year, we can substitute this value into the equation: 11.25 * x = 11.25 * 220 = 2475 movies.\nI hope it is correct: 2475 $movies$",
