He decided to only keep 15 cards and so he gave Miguel some of the cards. Then, he saw 8 friends and decided to give them 12 cards each, and the remaining cards were given equally to his 2 sisters. If each of Rick's sisters got 3 cards, how many cards did Rick give to Miguel?",

He gave 12 cards to each of his 8 friends, so he gave away 12 x 8 = 96 cards to his friends.\n3. He gave away 3 cards to each of his 2 sisters, so he gave away 3 x 2 = 6 cards to his sisters.\n4.
