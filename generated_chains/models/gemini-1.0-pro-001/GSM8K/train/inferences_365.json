The first five runners finish the race in 8 hours, while the rest of the runners finish the race 2 hours later. Calculate the total time the eight runners took to finish the race.",

The remaining three runners took 2 hours longer than the first five runners to finish the race. So, they took 8 + 2 = 10 hours to finish the race.\n\n3. The total time all eight runners took to finish the race is the sum of the time taken by the first five runners and the time taken by the remaining three runners.
