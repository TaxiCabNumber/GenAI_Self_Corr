        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let's represent her previous monthly income as \\(x\\).\n\n**Step 2:** Since she spent 40% of her income on rent and utilities, her rent and utility costs were 0.4x.\n\n**Step 3:** After her salary increased by $600, her new monthly income became \\(x + 600\\).\n\n**Step 4:** Now, her rent and utility costs represent only 25% of her new income, which is 0.25(x + 600).\n\n**Step 5:** We can set up the equation: 0.25(x + 600) = 0.4x.\n\n**Step 6:** Solving for x, we get: 0.25x + 150 = 0.4x.\n\n**Step 7:** Subtracting 0.25x from both sides: 150 = 0.15x.\n\n**Step 8:** Dividing by 0.15: x = 1000.\n\n**Therefore, her previous monthly income was $1,000.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 1000 $",
        "ground_truth": "Let her previous monthly income be p\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4\nEquating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000\nSubtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000\nDividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000\n#### 1000"
