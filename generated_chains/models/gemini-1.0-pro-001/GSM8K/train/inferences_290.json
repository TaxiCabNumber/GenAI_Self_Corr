At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA family has three adults and children, both girls and boys. They went out for a family trip and prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs for the trip. Every adult got 3 eggs, and the boys each received 1 more egg than each girl since the girls had some snacks. How many boys went on the trip if the number of girls was 7 and each girl received an egg?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total number of adults and children.\n3 adults + 7 girls + x boys = total number of people\n2. Determine the total number of eggs handed out to the adults and girls.\n3 adults * 3 eggs/adult = 9 eggs for adults\n7 girls * 1 egg/girl = 7 eggs for girls\n3. Determine the total number of eggs remaining for the boys.\n3 dozen eggs = 36 eggs\n9 eggs for adults + 7 eggs for girls = 16 eggs\n36 eggs - 16 eggs = 20 eggs for boys\n4. Calculate the number of boys that went on the trip.\nBoys received 1 more egg than each girl.\n20 eggs for boys / (1 egg/girl + 1 egg) = 10 boys\nI hope it is correct: 10 boys",
