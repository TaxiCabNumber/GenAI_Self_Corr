At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPete has to take a 10-minute walk down to the train station and then board a 1hr 20-minute train to LA. When should he leave if he cannot get to LA later than 0900 hours? (24-hr time)",
