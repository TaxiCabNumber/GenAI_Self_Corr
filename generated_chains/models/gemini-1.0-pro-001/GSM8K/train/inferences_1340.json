At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWilliam is a jockey. He can ride his horse for 6 hours a day. Over 6 days, he only used the maximum riding time twice.  On two days he rode his horse for only 1.5 hours a day and half the maximum time for the next two days. How many hours did William ride his horse during those 6 days?",
        "inference": "- William rode his horse for 6 hours a day for 2 days, for a total of 2 * 6 = 12 hours.\n- William rode his horse for 1.5 hours a day for 2 days, for a total of 2 * 1.5 = 3 hours.\n- William rode his horse for half the maximum time for 2 days. Since the maximum time is 6 hours, half the maximum time is 6 / 2 = 3 hours. So, for these 2 days, William rode his horse for a total of 2 * 3 = 6 hours.\n\n- Therefore, in total, William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = 21 hours during those 6 days.\n\nI hope it is correct: 21 hours",
        "ground_truth": "William used two days to the limit, which means 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours of horse riding.\nFor two days he rode a horse 1.5 a day, which makes up to 1.5 * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 hours.\nFor the next two days, he used only half of the maximum time which means 6 * 0.5 = <<6*0.5=3>>3 hours a day.\nThat means 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours during these two days.\nSo in total William rode his horse for 12 + 3 + 6 = <<12+3+6=21>>21 hours.\n#### 21"
