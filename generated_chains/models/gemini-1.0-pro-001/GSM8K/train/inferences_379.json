He then hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson but ends up getting a 25% discount.  How much did everything cost?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the piano: $500\n2. Calculate the cost of the lessons: 20 * $40 = $800\n3. Calculate the discount: $800 * 0.25 = $200\n4. Subtract the discount from the cost of the lessons: $800 - $200 = $600\n5. Add the cost of the piano to the cost of the lessons: $500 + $600 = $1100\n\n**Answer:**\n\nI hope it is correct: $1100",
