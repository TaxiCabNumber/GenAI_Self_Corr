She has eight hours to complete the task, and there are 1,500 envelopes. In the first hour, Rachel stuffs 135 envelopes. The second hour she stuffs 141 envelopes. How many envelopes will Rachel need to stuff per hour to finish the job?",

Divide the remaining envelopes by the remaining hours to find the number of envelopes Rachel needs to stuff per hour:\n1,224 / 6 = 204 envelopes per hour\n\n3. Add the number of envelopes stuffed in the first two hours to the number of envelopes to be stuffed per hour to find the total number of envelopes Rachel needs to stuff per hour:\n135 + 141 + 204 = 480 envelopes per hour\n\nI hope it is correct: 480 envelopes per hour",
