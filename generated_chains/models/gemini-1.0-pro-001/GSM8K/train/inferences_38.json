At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArtemis is making tea for a party. She knows her mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. She will use this same ratio for the party. The party has 12 people there and each of them wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. How many ounces of tea does she need?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the ratio of tea to water.\n8 ounces tea / 1 ounce water = 8/1\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of tea needed for 12 people.\n12 people x 6 ounces tea / person = 72 ounces tea\n\n3. Multiply the total amount of tea by the ratio.\n72 ounces tea x 8/1 = 576 ounces water\n\nI hope it is correct: 576",
        "ground_truth": "She is making 72 ounces of water because 12 x 6 = <<12*6=72>>72\nShe needs 9 ounces of tea because 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9\n#### 9"
