At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake is watching a new show, and is worried about how much time he has spent watching it. He spent half the day on Monday watching his show, 4 hours on Tuesday watching his show, a quarter of the day on Wednesday watching his show, and he spent half as much time watching the show on Thursday as he had done in total throughout the previous few days. On Friday, he finally finished watching it. If the entire show is 52 hours long, how many hours did Jake watch on Friday?",
        "inference": "1. **Monday:**  Half the day = 12 hours\n2. **Tuesday:**  4 hours\n3. **Wednesday:**  Quarter of the day = 6 hours\n4. **Thursday:**  Half of the total time watched till Wednesday = 11 hours\n5. **Total hours watched till Thursday:**  12 + 4 + 6 + 11 = 33 hours\n6. **Hours left to watch on Friday:**  52 - 33 = 19 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 19 $hours$",
        "ground_truth": "On Monday, Jake watched 24 hours / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 hours.\nOn Wednesday, he watched 24 hours / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6 hours.\nSo from Monday to Wednesday, he watched a total of 12 Monday hours + 4 Tuesday hours + 6 Wednesday hours = <<12+4+6=22>>22 hours.\nHe watched half of this on Thursday, which is 22 hours / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 hours.\nSo from Monday to Thursday, he watched 22 + 11 = <<22+11=33>>33 hours.\nTo finish the show on Friday, he must have therefore watched 52 \u2013 33 = <<52-33=19>>19 hours.\n#### 19"
