At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBryan works as a social media account manager. He does marketing posts, advertisement posts, and customer outreach posts. His client has him spend four hours on customer outreach posts and half that time on advertisement posts each day. Bryan works eight hours a day. How much time in hours each day does he spend on marketing posts?",
        "inference": "1) Since Bryan works eight hours a day and four hours are used for customer outreach posts\n2) that leaves four hours remaining. \n3) If half the time left is spent on advertisement posts, \n4)  that is two hours. \n5) Four hours minus two hours is two hours. \n\nTwo hours is the remaining time that Bryan has for marketing posts.\nI hope it is correct: 2 hours",
        "ground_truth": "Let M be the number of hours Bryan spends on marketing posts.\nHe spends 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 hours on advertisement posts a day.\nHe works M + 4 + 2 = 8 hours a day.\nThus, Bryan spends M = 8 - 4 - 2 = <<8-4-2=2>>2 hours on marketing posts each day.\n#### 2"
