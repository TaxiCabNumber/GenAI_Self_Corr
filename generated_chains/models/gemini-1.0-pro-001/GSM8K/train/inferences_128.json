At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA school principal is booking hotel rooms for a class of 30 students to stay at during an overnight field trip.  Each of the hotel's rooms has two queen size beds, which can fit two students each, and a pull-out couch, which can fit one student.  How many rooms does the principal need to book to fit all of the students in the class?",
        "inference": "1. Divide the total number of students by the number of students that can fit in each room.\n30 students / 3 students per room = 10 rooms\n\nI hope it is correct: 10",
        "ground_truth": "Each room can fit 2*2 + 1 = <<2*2+1=5>>5 students.\nThus, the principal needs to book 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6 rooms to fit everyone.\n#### 6"
