At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTracy, Michelle, and Kati take a road trip that is a total of 1000 miles.  Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, and Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives. How many miles does Michelle drive?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assign a variable to Katie's driving distance, x.\n2. Since Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, Michelle drives 3x miles.\n3. Since Tracy drives 20 miles more than twice Michelle, Tracy drives 2(3x) + 20 = 6x + 20 miles.\n4. The total distance they drive is 1000 miles, so we can write an equation: x + 3x + 6x + 20 = 1000.\n5. Combining like terms, we get 10x + 20 = 1000.\n6. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 10x = 980.\n7. Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 98.\n8. Since Michelle drives 3 times the amount that Katie drives, Michelle drives 3x = 3(98) = 294 miles.\n\nI hope it is correct: $294$",
