Over the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks. That means he eats another 14 apples in the next three weeks.\n\n3. Over the next two weeks, he eats 3 apples a day. That means he eats 42 apples in the next two weeks.\n\n4. Over these 7 weeks, he eats a total of 70 apples.\n\n5. To find the average number of apples he eats a week, we divide the total number of apples by the number of weeks: 70 apples / 7 weeks = 10 apples per week.\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 apples per week",
