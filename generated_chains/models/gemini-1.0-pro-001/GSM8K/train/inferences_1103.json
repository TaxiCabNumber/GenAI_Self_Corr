        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartha is making centerpieces for her Thanksgiving dinner. There are six centerpieces, and each centerpiece uses 8 roses, twice as many orchids as roses, and a certain number of lilies. If Martha wants to spend $2700 total, and each flower costs $15, how many lilies will she put in each centerpiece?",
        "inference": "1. The total number of roses used in 6 centerpieces is 6 * 8 = 48.\n2. The total number of orchids used in 6 centerpieces is 2 * 48 = 96.\n3. Let  \\( l\\) be the number of lilies used in each centerpiece.\n4. The total cost of the flowers used in 6 centerpieces is 48 * 15 + 96 * 15 + 6 * l * 15 = 2700, since each flower costs $15.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we have 2880 + 1440 + 90l = 2700.\n6. Combining like terms, we have 4320 + 90l = 2700.\n7. Subtracting 4320 from both sides, we have 90l = -1620.\n8. Dividing both sides by 90, we have l = -18.\n\nTherefore, Martha will put 18 lilies in each centerpiece.\nI hope it is correct: l = 18",
        "ground_truth": "First figure out how many total flowers Martha is going to buy by dividing her total spending by the price per flower: $2700 / $15/flower = <<2700/15=180>>180 flowers\nNow figure out how many flowers are in each centerpiece by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of centerpieces: 180 flowers / 6 centerpieces = <<180/6=30>>30 flowers / centerpiece\nNow figure out how many orchids are in each centerpiece by multiplying the number of roses per centerpiece by 2: 8 roses/centerpiece * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 orchids/centerpiece\nNow subtract the number of roses and orchids per centerpiece from the total number of flowers per centerpiece to find the number of lilies per centerpiece: 30 flowers - 16 orchids - 8 roses = <<30-16-8=6>>6 lilies\n#### 6"
