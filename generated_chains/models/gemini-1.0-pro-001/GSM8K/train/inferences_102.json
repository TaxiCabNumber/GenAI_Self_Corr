At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEllie has found an old bicycle in a field and thinks it just needs some oil to work well again.  She needs 10ml of oil to fix each wheel and will need another 5ml of oil to fix the rest of the bike. How much oil does she need in total to fix the bike?",
