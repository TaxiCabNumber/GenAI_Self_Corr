At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt's Ava's birthday party. Her parents bought a unicorn pi\u00f1ata for $13 and filled it with all of her favorite treats. They bought 4 bags of Reese's for $9 per bag, 3 bags of Snickers for $5 per bag, and 5 bags of Skittles for $7 per bag. How much did the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost altogether?",
        "inference": "1. The cost of the unicorn pi\u00f1ata is $13.\n2. The cost of 4 bags of Reese's is $9 per bag, so the total cost is 4 x $9 = $36.\n3. The cost of 3 bags of Snickers is $5 per bag, so the total cost is 3 x $5 = $15.\n4. The cost of 5 bags of Skittles is $7 per bag, so the total cost is 5 x $7 = $35.\n5. The total cost of the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats is $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $99.\n\nI hope it is correct: $99",
        "ground_truth": "The four bags of Reese's cost $9 x 4 = $<<9*4=36>>36.\nThe three bags of Snickers cost $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\nThe five bags of Skittles cost $7 x 5 = $<<7*5=35>>35.\nTherefore, the unicorn pi\u00f1ata and the treats cost $13 + $36 + $15 + $35 = $<<13+36+15+35=99>>99.\n#### 99"
