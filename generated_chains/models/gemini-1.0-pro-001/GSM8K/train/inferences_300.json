At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt costs $.10 to print one page. Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay. She also wants to buy 7 pens that each cost $1.50. If she pays the store with 2 twenty dollar bills, how much money should she get in change?",
