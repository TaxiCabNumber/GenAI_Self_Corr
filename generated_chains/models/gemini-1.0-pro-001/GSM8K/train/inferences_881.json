At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark loves to see shows in theaters. He decided to visit the theater at least once a week. One performance lasts 3 hours. The price of the ticket depends on the time spent in the theater and stands at $5 for each hour. How much will Mark spend on visits to the theater in 6 weeks?",

        "ground_truth": "The price of one performance is 3 * $5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nMark intends to go to the theater once a week, so in 9 weeks he will spend 6 * $15 = $<<6*15=90>>90.\n#### 90"
