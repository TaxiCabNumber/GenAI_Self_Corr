At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn a school trip to the seashore, Alan and his friends collected shells. Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. Ben got a late start and only collected a third of what Laurie did. If Laurie collected 36 shells how many did Alan collect?",
