At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohns goes to the gym 3 times a week.  He spends 1 hour each day lifting weight. Additionally, he also spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day.  How many hours does he spend at the gym a week?",
        "inference": "First, we need to calculate the total time John spends weightlifting each week. Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week and spends 1 hour each day lifting weights, he spends a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours weightlifting each week.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total time John spends warming up and doing cardio each week. Since he spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day, he spends a total of 3 * 1/3 = 1 hour warming up and doing cardio each week.\n\nFinally, we can add the total time John spends weightlifting and the total time he spends warming up and doing cardio to get the total time he spends at the gym each week. This gives us 3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours.\n\nI hope it is correct: $4$",
        "ground_truth": "He spends 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 minutes warming up\nSo he spends 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes at the gym per day\nThat means he spends 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 minutes at the gym\nSo he spends 240/60=<<240/60=4>>4 hours at the gym a week\n#### 4"
