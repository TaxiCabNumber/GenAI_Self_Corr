At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLouie obtained 80% on a math quiz. He had 5 mistakes. How many items were there on the math quiz?",
        "inference": "Let the number of items on the quiz be 'x'\n\nAccording to the given information, 80% of the total items were correct. So, the number of correct items is: \nCorrect items = 80 * x/100 = 4 * x/5\n\nThe number of incorrect items was 5. So, the total number of items on the quiz is:\n\nTotal items (x) = Correct items + Incorrect items = 4 * x/5 + 5\n\nNow, we need to solve for 'x'.\n\nSubtracting 4 * x/5 from both sides, we get:\nx - 4 * x/5 = 5\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n5 * x - 4 * x = 25\nx = 25\nI hope it is correct: The number of items on the quiz is 25",
        "ground_truth": "Louie got 100% - 80% = 20% of the total items incorrect, which is equal to 5 items.\nSo 1% is equal to 5/20 = 1/4 of an item.\nHence, the total number of items, represented by 100%, on the math quiz was 1/4 of an item x 100 = <<1/4*100=25>>25.\n#### 25"
