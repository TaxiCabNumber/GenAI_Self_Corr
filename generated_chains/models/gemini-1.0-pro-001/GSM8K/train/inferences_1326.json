At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGargamel needed new tires for his truck. He went to the auto shop and bought 4 tires on sale for $75 each. The salesman told him that he saved a total of $36. If Gargamel saved the same amount on each tire, what was the original price of each tire?",
