At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA store received 20 pallets of paper products to stock. Half the pallets were paper towels, a quarter were tissues, and a fifth were paper plates. The rest were paper cups. How many pallets of paper cups did the store receive?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of pallets of paper towels: 20 pallets / 2 = 10 pallets of paper towels\n2. Calculate the number of pallets of tissues: 20 pallets / 4 = 5 pallets of tissues\n3. Calculate the number of pallets of paper plates: 20 pallets / 5 = 4 pallets of paper plates\n4. Subtract the total number of pallets of paper towels, tissues, and paper plates from the total number of pallets received to get the number of pallets of paper cups: 20 pallets - 10 pallets of paper towels - 5 pallets of tissues - 4 pallets of paper plates = 1 pallet of paper cups\nI hope it is correct: 1 pallet of paper cups",
        "ground_truth": "The store received 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 pallets of paper towels.\nThey received 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pallets of tissues.\nThey received 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 pallets of paper plates.\nThus, the store received 20 - 10 - 5 - 4 = <<20-10-5-4=1>>1 pallet of paper cups.\n#### 1"
