At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn takes a 10-minute shower every other day for 4 weeks. If his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.  How much water does he use in those 4 weeks?",

Each shower is 10 minutes long, so he will have showered for a total of 14 * 10 = 140 minutes.\n3. His shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute, so he will have used a total of 140 * 2 = 280 gallons of water.\n\nI hope it is correct: 280",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4*7=<<4*7=28>>28 days in those 4 weeks\nThat means he takes 28/2=<<28/2=14>>14 showers\nSo he takes a total of 14*10=<<14*10=140>>140 minutes of showers\nSo he uses 2*140=<<2*140=280>>280 gallons of water\n#### 280"
