        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn the first day of the journey, the Skipper sailed his ship halfway to the destination by traveling due east for 20 hours at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, and then turned the ship's engines off to let them cool down. But while the engines were off, a wind storm blew his vessel backward in a westward direction.  After the storm, the Skipper used his GPS device to determine the new location of the ship, and he discovered that he was only one-third of the way to his destination.  How many kilometers had the ship been blown in a westward direction by the storm?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the distance traveled on the first day:\nDistance = speed x time = 30 km/h x 20 h = 600 km\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the fraction of the journey completed on the first day:\nFraction = 1/2 (since the Skipper sailed halfway to the destination)\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the remaining distance to the destination:\nRemaining distance = Total distance - Distance traveled on the first day = 600 km - 600 km = 0 km\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the fraction of the journey remaining:\nFraction = 1 - Fraction completed on the first day = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the distance blown westward by the storm:\nLet's represent the distance blown westward as \"x\". Since the ship is now one-third of the way to the destination, we have:\n1/3 x Total distance = x\n\nSubstituting the value of the total distance (0 km) into the equation, we get:\n1/3 x 0 km = x\n\n**Therefore, the ship was blown backward in a westward direction by 0 kilometers by the storm.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 0 km",
        "ground_truth": "Traveling 20 hours due east at 30 kilometers per hour, the ship sailed 20*30=<<20*30=600>>600 kilometers the first day.\nIf half the distance to the destination is 600 kilometers, then 2*600=<<2*600=1200>>1200 kilometers is the total distance from start to destination.\nOne-third of the distance from start to destination is 1/3 * 1200 = <<1200/3=400>>400 kilometers.\nThus, the wind storm blew the ship in a westward direction for 600 - 400 = <<600-400=200>>200 kilometers.\n#### 200"
