At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA high school bowling team's 3 members scored a total of 810 points in their first match.  The first bowler scored 1/3 as many points as the second, and the second bowler scored 3 times as high as the third bowler.  How many points did the third bowler score?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of points scored by the third bowler. \n\nThe second bowler scored 3x points. \n\nThe first bowler scored 1/3 of 3x = x points. \n\nThe total points scored by the three bowlers is x + 3x + x = 5x. \n\nThis total is given as 810, so 5x = 810. \n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 162. \n\nI hope it is correct: The third bowler scored 162 points.",
