At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Determine the percentage of germs killed by each spray separately.**\n\n* Spray 1 kills 50% of germs, so 50% of germs remain after using spray 1.\n* Spray 2 kills 25% of germs, so 75% of germs remain after using spray 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the percentage of germs killed by both sprays together.**\n\n* The 5% of germs killed by both sprays are already included in the percentages killed by each spray separately.\n* Therefore, the percentage of germs killed by both sprays together is 50% + 25% - 5% = 70%.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the percentage of germs remaining after using both sprays together.**\n\n* 70% of germs are killed by both sprays together, so 100% - 70% = 30% of germs remain.\n\n**Therefore, the percentage of germs left after using both sanitizer sprays together is 30%.**\n\nI hope it is correct: 30%",
        "ground_truth": "After the first spray kills 50% of germs, there will be 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50% left.\nThe second spray kills 25%, but 5% have already been killed by the 50% spray, so it kills 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20%.\nAfter the second spray kills 20% of the remaining germs, there will be 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30% left.\n#### 30"
