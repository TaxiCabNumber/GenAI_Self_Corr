At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo pass the time while she is waiting somewhere Carla likes to count things around her. While she is waiting for school to start on Monday she counts the tiles on the ceiling--38. While she is waiting for everyone to finish their tests after she has handed in hers, she counts the books in the room--75. On Tuesday Carla counts all the tiles twice in a row and she counts the books three times in a row when she has to wait for a long time for the teacher to finish handing out the graded tests. If every time Carla counts something counts as once, how many times has Carla counted something on Tuesday?",

She counted the tiles 76 times, and the books 225 times, so she counted a total of 76 + 225 = 301 times on Tuesday\nI hope it is correct: 301",
        "ground_truth": "When Carla was waiting on Monday she counted 38 ceiling tiles and on Tuesday she counted them twice, 38 ceiling tiles x 2 = <<38*2=76>>76 times she counted a ceiling tile.\nShe also counted 75 books in the room on Monday and counted them three times in a row on Tuesday, 75 books x 3 = <<75*3=225>>225 times she counted a book.\nOn Tuesday Carla counted the ceiling tiles 76 times + counted books 225 times = <<76+225=301>>301 times Carla counted something on Tuesday.\n#### 301"
