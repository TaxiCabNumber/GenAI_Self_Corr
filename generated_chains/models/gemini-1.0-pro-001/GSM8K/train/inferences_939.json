At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 20 students in the class. Half of them play basketball. Two-fifths play volleyball and one-tenth play both basketball and volleyball.  How many students in this class do not play either game?",
        "inference": "1. Half of the students play basketball, which is 20 * 1/2 = 10 students.  \n2. Two-fifths of the students play volleyball, which is 20 * 2/5 = 8 students.  \n3. One-tenth of the students play both basketball and volleyball, which is 20 * 1/10 = 2 students.  \n4. To find the number of students who do not play either game, we need to subtract the number of students who play basketball, volleyball, or both from the total number of students.  \n5. So, the number of students who do not play either game is 20 - 10 - 8 + 2 = 4.  \nI hope it is correct: 4",
