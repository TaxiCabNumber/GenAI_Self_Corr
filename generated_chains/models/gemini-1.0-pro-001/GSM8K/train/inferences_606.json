At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a big box, there are marbles in 4 colors. Inside, there are 20 red marbles.  There are three times more green marbles than red.  Yellow marbles make up 20% of the green marbles. How many marbles are of a different color if the total of all marbles in the box is three times more than the number of green marbles?",

The number of yellow marbles is 20% of the number of green marbles, so there are 0.2 x 60 = 12 yellow marbles.\n\n3. The total number of marbles in the box is three times the number of green marbles, so there are 3 x 60 = 180 marbles in total.\n\n4. The number of marbles that are of a different color is the total number of marbles minus the number of red, green, and yellow marbles, so there are 180 - 20 - 60 - 12 = 88 marbles that are of a different color.\nI hope it is correct: 88",
