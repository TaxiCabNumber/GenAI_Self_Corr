At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA certain tree was 100 meters tall at the end of 2017. It will grow 10% more than its previous height each year. How long has the tree grown from 2017 until the end of 2019?",
        "inference": "- In 2018, the tree was 100% + 10% = 110% of its 2017 height, which is 110% x 100 m = 110 m.\n- In 2019, the tree was 110% + 10% = 121% of its 2018 height, which is 121% x 110 m = 133.1 m.\n- Therefore, the tree has grown 133.1 m - 100 m = 33.1 m from 2017 until the end of 2019.\nI hope it is correct: 33.1 m",
        "ground_truth": "At the end of 2018, the tree will grow 100 x 10/100 = <<100*10/100=10>>10 meters more.\nThus, its height at the end of 2018 is 100 + 10 = <<100+10=110>>110 meters.\nAt the end of 2019, the tree will grow 110 x 10/100 = <<110*10/100=11>>11 meters more.\nSo, its height at the end of 2019 is 110 + 11 = <<110+11=121>>121 meters.\nTherefore, the tree has grown 121 - 100 = <<121-100=21>>21 meters.\n#### 21"
