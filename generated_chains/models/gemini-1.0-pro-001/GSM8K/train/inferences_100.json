At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?",
        "inference": "1. Let's call the number of sales in the stationery section \"S\".\n\n2. We know that the craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, so the number of sales in the fabric section is 36/3 = 12.\n\n3. We also know that the craft store makes a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, so the number of sales in the jewelry section is 36/4 = 9.\n\n4. Therefore, the number of sales in the stationery section is S = 36 - 12 - 9 = 15.\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
