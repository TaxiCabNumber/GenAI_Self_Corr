At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHannah comes home from work to find her older son taped her younger son to a chair with 22 strands of duct tape. If Hannah can cut 8 strands per minute and her son can cut 3 strands per minute, how long will it take them to free her younger son?",
        "inference": "**Hannah's rate:**  8 strands per minute\n**Son's rate:** 3 strands per minute\n\n**Combined rate:** 8 + 3 = 11 strands per minute\n\n**Number of strands to cut:** 22 strands\n\n**Time to cut:** 22 strands / 11 strands per minute = 2 minutes\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total number of strands the two of them can cut per minute: 8 strands + 3 strands = <<8+3=11>>11 strands\nThen divide the total number of strands by the number of strands they cut per minute to find the number of minutes it takes to cut all the strands: 22 strands / 11 strands/minute = <<22/11=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2"
