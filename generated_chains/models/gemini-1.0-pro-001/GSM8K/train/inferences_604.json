At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSantana has 7 brothers. 3 of them have birthdays in March, 1 of them has a birthday in October, 1 has a birthday in November, and another 2 of them were born in December. If Santana always buys each of her brothers a birthday present and a Christmas present, how many more presents does she have to buy in the second half of the year than the first half of the year?",
        "inference": "Santana has 7 brothers. 3 of them have birthdays in March, which is in the first half of the year. So, she needs to buy 3 birthday presents in the first half of the year. 1 of her brothers has a birthday in October, 1 in November, and 2 in December, which are all in the second half of the year. So, she needs to buy 4 birthday presents in the second half of the year. She also needs to buy Christmas presents for all 7 of her brothers, regardless of when their birthdays are. So, she needs to buy 7 Christmas presents. Therefore, the total number of presents she needs to buy in the second half of the year is 4 + 7 = 11. And the total number of presents she needs to buy in the first half of the year is 3 + 7 = 10. So, she needs to buy 11 - 10 = 1 more present in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.\nI hope it is correct: 1",
        "ground_truth": "Santana has 1 + 1 + 2 = <<1+1+2=4>>4 brothers with birthdays in the second half of the year.\nShe has 7 brothers - 4 brothers = <<7-4=3>>3 brothers with birthdays in the first half of the year.\nAltogether, she has to buy 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 presents in the second half of the year.\nTherefore, she has to buy 11 - 3 = <<11-3=8>>8 more presents in the second half of the year.\n#### 8"
