The first center processes 10000 packages per day, and the second center processes three times that volume. If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, how much profit per week do the two centers make combined?",

Calculate the number of packages processed by both centers per week.\n40000 x 7 = 280000 packages per week\n\n4. Calculate the profit per package.\n5 cents per package\n\n5.
