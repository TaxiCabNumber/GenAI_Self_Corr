At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary does her grocery shopping on Saturday. She does her shopping only at a specific store where she is allowed a credit of $100, which must be paid in full before her next shopping trip. That week she spent the full credit limit and paid $15 of it on Tuesday and $23 of it on Thursday. How much credit will Mary need to pay before her next shopping trip?",

        "ground_truth": "So far, Mary has paid back $15 +$23=$<<15+23=38>>38 of the credit.\nSo she still needs to pay $100-$38=$<<100-38=62>>62\n#### 62"
