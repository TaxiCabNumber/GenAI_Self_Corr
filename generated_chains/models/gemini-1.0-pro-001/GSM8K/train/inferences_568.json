At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn pays for half the cost of raising a child.  It cost $10,000 a year for the first 8 years and then twice that much per year until the child is 18.  University tuition then costs $250,000.  How much did it cost?",
