At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJosh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?",
        "inference": "1. Let's call the width of the sandbox 'w' feet.\n2. Since the length is twice the width, the length is '2w' feet.\n3. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(length + width)\n4. Substituting the values we know, we get: 30 = 2(2w + w)\n5. Simplifying the equation: 30 = 2(3w)\n6. Dividing both sides by 2: 15 = 3w\n7. Dividing both sides by 3: w = 5\n8. Therefore, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.\n\nI hope it is correct: w=5",
        "ground_truth": "There are four sides to a rectangle, the width is W and so the length is 2W, and we can put that in this equation: W + W + 2W + 2W = 30 feet.\nIf we add the sides together, we get 6W = 30 feet.\nTo find W, we divide both sides by 6, like this: 6W / 6 = 30 feet / 6, so W = 5 feet.\n#### 5"
