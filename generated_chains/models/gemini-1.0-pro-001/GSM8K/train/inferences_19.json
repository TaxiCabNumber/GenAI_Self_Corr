At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",

He also rides 200 miles on the weekend, for a total of 200 + 200 = 400 miles per week.  At 25 mph, it takes him 400 / 25 = 16 hours to bike each week.\n\nI hope it is correct: #### 16 hours",
        "ground_truth": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16"
