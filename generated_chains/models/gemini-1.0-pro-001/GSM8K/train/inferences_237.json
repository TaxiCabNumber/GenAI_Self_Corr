At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected?",
        "inference": "1. In the first round, Tank collected 10 eggs more than Emma. Suppose Tank collected x eggs in the first round. Then Emma collected (x - 10) eggs.\n2. In the second round, Emma collected twice as many eggs as Tank, which is 2 * x eggs. Tank collected 20 eggs less than the number he gathered in the first round, which is (x - 20) eggs.\n3. Let the total number of eggs collected by the other 6 egg hunters be y. Then the total number of eggs collected in both rounds by all 8 people is x + (x - 10) + 2 * x + (x - 20) + y = 400 eggs.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get 5 * x - 30 + y = 400.\n5. We know that Emma collected 60 eggs in the second round. Therefore, y = 400 - (5 * x - 30 + 60) = 310.\nI hope it is correct: 310",
