At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBobby needs to buy a new pair of fancy shoes.  He decides to go to a cobbler and get them handmade.  The cobbler charges $250 to make the mold.  He then charges $75 an hour for 8 hours to make the shoes.  The cobbler agrees to only charge 80% of the cost for work to make the shoes, since it is his first pair of shoes.  How much did Bobby pay?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the cost of the mold: $250\n2. Calculate the cost of the labor: 8 hours x $75/hour = $600\n3. Calculate the discount on the labor: $600 x 0.80 = $480\n4. Add the cost of the mold and the discounted labor cost: $250 + $480 = $730\nI hope it is correct: $730$",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of labor is 75*8=$<<75*8=600>>600\nSo Bobby pays 600*.8=$<<600*.8=480>>480\nSo that means Bobby pays 480+250=$<<480+250=730>>730\n#### 730"
