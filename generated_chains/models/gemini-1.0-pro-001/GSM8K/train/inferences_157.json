At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA young girl pours 23 blue beads and 16 yellow beads into a bowl. She divides the total into 3 equal parts, removes some beads from each part, and doubles the rest to have 6 beads in each part now. How many beads were removed from each part?",
        "inference": "1. First, we find the total number of beads: 23 + 16 = 39 beads.\n2. Next, we find the number of beads in each part after the division: 39 / 3 = 13 beads.\n3. Now, we subtract the number of beads in each part after the division from the number of beads in each part after the doubling: 13 - 6 = 7 beads.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 7**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 23+16=<<23+16=39>>39 beads in the bowl\nDividing them into 3 equal parts give 39/3=<<39/3=13>>13 beads each\nBefore doubling the number of beads, she had 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 beads left in each part.\nTherefore she had removed 13-3=<<13-3=10>>10 beads from each part.\n#### 10"
