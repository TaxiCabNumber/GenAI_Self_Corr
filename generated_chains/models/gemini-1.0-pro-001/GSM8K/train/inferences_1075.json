At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCelina enjoys hiking in the mountains. Due to a lack of proper equipment, she decided to order a new pair of boots, a flashlight, and a special hoodie. The hoodie cost $80 and the flashlight was only 20% of that price. The pair of boots cost was $110, but due to a special promotion, Celina was able to buy them 10% cheaper. How much did Celina spend in total on the above-mentioned equipment?",
        "inference": "**1- Flashlight cost:**\n20% of $80 = 0.2 x $80 = $16\n\n**2- Boots discounted cost:**\n10% cheaper than $110 = $110 - 0.1 x $110 = $99\n\n**3- Total expenditure:**\nFlashlight ($16) + Hoodie ($80) + Boots ($99) = $195\n\n\nI hope it is correct: $195",
        "ground_truth": "The flashlight was 20% of the price of the hoodie, so 80 * 20/100 = $<<80*20/100=16>>16.\nThe promotion for a pair of boots was 110 * 10/100 = $<<110*10/100=11>>11.\nSo the pair of boots cost 110 - 11 = $<<110-11=99>>99.\nCelina therefore spent 80 + 16 + 99 = $<<80+16+99=195>>195 on the equipment.\n#### 195"
