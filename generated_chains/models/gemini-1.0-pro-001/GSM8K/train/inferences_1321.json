At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPauline is buying school supplies. The total amount of all the items she wants to buy add up to $150 before sales tax. Sales tax is 8% of the total amount purchased. How much will Pauline spend on all the items, including sales tax?",

        "ground_truth": "Sales tax is 8/100 x $150= $<<8/100*150=12>>12.\nTherefore, Pauline wil spend $150 + $12 = $<<150+12=162>>162, including sales tax.\n#### 162"
