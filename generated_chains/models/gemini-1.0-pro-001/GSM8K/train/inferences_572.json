At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSteve wanted to make a total of $100 within four days, so he took on a berry-picking job in Sweden. The job paid $2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. On Monday he picked 8 pounds. Tuesday\u2019s harvest was triple what he had picked the previous day. On Wednesday he felt very tired and decided to rest. How many pounds of lingonberries did Steve have to pick on Thursday?",
        "inference": "- Steve picked 8 pounds on Monday and earned 8 x 2 = $16.\n\n\n- On Tuesday, he picked three times as much as he did on Monday, so he picked 8 x 3 = 24 pounds and earned 24 x 2 = $48.\n\n\n- Steve did not pick any lingonberries on Wednesday.\n\n\n- So, to make a total of $100 within four days, he needs to earn $100 - $16 - $48 = $36 on Thursday.\n\n\n- To calculate how many pounds of lingonberries Steve needs to pick on Thursday, we divide the amount he needs to earn by the amount he earns per pound: $36 / 2 = 18 pounds. \nI hope it is correct: 18$",
