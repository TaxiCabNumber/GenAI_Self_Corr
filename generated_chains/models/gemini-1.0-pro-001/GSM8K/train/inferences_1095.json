A friend of his owns different types of cycles, which have three times are many tires as Ignatius's bikes have. He has one unicycle, a tricycle, and the rest are bikes. How many bicycles does the friend own?",
        "inference": "- Ignatius has 4 bicycles, so each bicycle has 2 tires (4 * 2 = 8 tires). \n- The friend has three times as many tires as Ignatius's bikes, so the friend has 24 tires (8 * 3 = 24 tires). \n- The friend has one unicycle, which has 1 tire, and a tricycle, which has 3 tires, so the friend has 4 tires (1 + 3 = 4 tires) from these two cycles. \n- The friend has 24 tires total, and 4 tires from the unicycle and tricycle, so the friend has 20 tires (24 - 4 = 20 tires) from bikes. \n- Since each bike has 2 tires, the friend has 10 bikes (20 tires / 2 tires per bike = 10 bikes).\n\nI hope it is correct: 10",
