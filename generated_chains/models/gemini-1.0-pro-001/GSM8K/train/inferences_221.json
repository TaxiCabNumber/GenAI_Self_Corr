At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMira jogs every morning. She jogs 5 miles per hour. If she jogs for 2 hours every morning, how many miles can she jog for five days?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the number of days to hours: 5 days \u00d7 24 hours/day = 120 hours\n2. Multiply the number of hours by the speed: 120 hours \u00d7 5 miles/hour = 600 miles\nI hope it is correct: 600 miles",
        "ground_truth": "Mira jogs 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles per day.\nTherefore she can jog 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50 miles for 5 days.\n#### 50"
