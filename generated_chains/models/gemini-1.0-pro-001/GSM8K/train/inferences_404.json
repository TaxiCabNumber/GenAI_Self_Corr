At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hay farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres of grass per month last year. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres of grass. If the farmer also owns 9 horses and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, how many bales of hay would the farmer have left by the end of December if he starts feeding them this year's hay beginning the first day of September?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the number of bales of hay harvested per acre**\n- 560 bales / 5 acres = 112 bales per acre\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of bales of hay harvested from the additional 7 acres**\n- 112 bales per acre x 7 acres = 844 bales\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of bales of hay harvested this year**\n- 560 bales + 844 bales = 1,404 bales\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of days between September 1st and December 31st**\n- December 31st - September 1st = 122 days\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of bales of hay consumed by the horses**\n- 3 bales per horse per day x 9 horses = 27 bales per day\n- 27 bales per day x 122 days = 3,318 bales\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the number of bales of hay left**\n- 1,404 bales - 3,318 bales = -1,914 bales\n\n**Conclusion:** The farmer would have -1,914 bales of hay left by the end of December. This means that he would not have enough hay to feed his horses for the entire year.\n\nI hope it is correct: -1,914 bales",
