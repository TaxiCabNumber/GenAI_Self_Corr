At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAbigail is trying a new recipe for a cold drink. It uses 1/4 of a cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 of a cup of lemonade to make one drink. If she fills a pitcher with 18 total cups of this drink, how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the total number of drinks in the pitcher: \n18 cups / 1 drink = 18 drinks\n\n2. Calculate the amount of lemonade in each drink: \n1 and 1/4 cups / drink = 1.25 cups lemonade / drink\n\n3. Multiply the amount of lemonade per drink by the total number of drinks:\n1.25 cups lemonade / drink * 18 drinks = 22.5 cups lemonade\n\nI hope it is correct: 22.5",
        "ground_truth": "Each drink uses 1.5 cups because 1/4 cup + 1 and 1/4 cup = <<1.5=1.5>>1.5 cups\nThe pitcher contains 12 total drinks because 18 / 1.5 = <<18/1.5=12>>12\nThere are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher because 12 x 1 and 1/4 = 15\n#### 15"
