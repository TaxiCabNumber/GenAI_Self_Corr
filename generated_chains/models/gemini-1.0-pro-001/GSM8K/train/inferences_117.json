At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish. 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank, and the remaining blowfish swim into a display tank.  An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, but then a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.  If the aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, how many clownfish are now in the display tank?",

Since there is an equal number of clownfish, there are also x clownfish.\n\n**Step 2:** 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so the remaining blowfish are x - 26.\n\n**Step 3:** An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so the number of clownfish in the display tank is also x - 26.\n\n**Step 4:** Then, a third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank, so the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is: (x - 26) / 3\n\n**Step 5:** The aquarium holds a combined total of 100 fish, so we can write an equation: x + x - 26 + (x - 26) / 3 = 100\n\n**Step 6:** Solving for x:\n- 3x - 78 = 300\n- 3x = 378\n- x = 126\n\n**Step 7:** Therefore, the number of clownfish in the display tank is: (x - 26) / 3 = (126 - 26) / 3 = 33\n\n**I hope it is correct: 33.**",
