At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA typical tournament of tennis has 4 rounds. There are 8 games in the first round, 4 in the second round, 2 in the third round and 1 during the finals. If each game requires new tennis balls, and on average each game uses 5 cans of tennis balls, how many tennis balls in total are used at the end of the tournament if each can has 3 tennis balls?",

This gives a total of 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 games.\n\n2. We need to find the number of tennis balls used in each game. On average, each game uses 5 cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. Therefore, each game uses a total of 5 * 3 = 15 tennis balls.\n\n3. We need to find the total number of tennis balls used in the tournament. We have 15 games and each game uses 15 tennis balls. Therefore, the total number of tennis balls used is 15 * 15 = 225 tennis balls.\n\nI hope it is correct: 225",
