At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJenny has a tummy ache. Her brother Mike says that it is because Jenny ate 5 more than thrice the number of chocolate squares that he ate.  If Mike ate 20 chocolate squares, how many did Jenny eat?",
