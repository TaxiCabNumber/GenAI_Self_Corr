At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?",
        "inference": "1. Frankie won half as many games as Carla. \n2. If Frankie won x games, then Carla won 2x games. \n3. Frankie and Carla played 30 games in total, so x + 2x = 30. \n4. Combining like terms, we have 3x = 30. \n5. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 10. \n6. Therefore, Carla won 2x games, which is 2 * 10 = 20 games.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of games that Frankie won.\nThen the number of games Carla won would be 2*x.\nAnd the sum of all the games would be x+2*x=30 games.\nThus, the expression simplifies to 3*x=30.\nAnd the value of x=<<10=10>>10 games.\nTherefore, the number of Carla's wins would be 2x=20 games.\n#### 20"
