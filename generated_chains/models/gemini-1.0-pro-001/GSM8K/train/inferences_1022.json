At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?",
        "inference": "Let's assume Leah's age is 'x'. Therefore, Rachel's age is 'x + 4'.\n\nAccording to the given information, the sum of their ages is 34. So, we can write an equation:\nx + (x + 4) = 34\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n2x + 4 = 34\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n2x = 30\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, Leah's age is 15, and Rachel's age is 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nI hope it is correct: 19",
        "ground_truth": "If Rachel and Leah have the same age, then the sum of their ages would be 34 - 4 = <<34-4=30>>30.\nSo Leah would be 30/2 = <<30/2=15>>15 years old.\nHence, Rachel is 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19"
