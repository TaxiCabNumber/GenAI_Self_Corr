At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nChang's Garden has two kinds of apples. Sweet ones and sour ones. He can sell the sweet ones for $.5 an apple. The sour ones sell for $.1 an apple. 75% of the apples he gets are sweet and the rest are sour. If he earns $40, how many apples did his trees give him?",
