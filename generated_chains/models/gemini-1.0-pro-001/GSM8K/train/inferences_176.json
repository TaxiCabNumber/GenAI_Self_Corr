At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA store sells 20 packets of 100 grams of sugar every week. How many kilograms of sugar does it sell every week?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the weight of each packet from grams to kilograms: 100 grams = 0.1 kilograms\n2. Multiply the weight of each packet by the number of packets sold: 0.1 kilograms/packet x 20 packets = 2 kilograms\n3. Therefore, the store sells 2 kilograms of sugar every week.\nI hope it is correct: 2 kg",
        "ground_truth": "A total of 20 x 100 = <<20*100=2000>>2000 grams are sold every week.\nSince 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, then 2000/1000 = <<2000/1000=2>>2 kilograms of sugar are sold every week.\n#### 2"
