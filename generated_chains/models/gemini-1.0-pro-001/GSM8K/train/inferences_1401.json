At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn one month in the Smith house, Kylie uses 3 bath towels, her 2 daughters use a total of 6 bath towels, and her husband uses a total of 3 bath towels. If the washing machine can fit 4 bath towels for one load of laundry, how many loads of laundry will the Smiths need to do to clean all of their used towels?",
