At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the 20% down payment: $1000 x 0.20 = $200\n2. Add the additional $20: $200 + $20 = $220\n3. Subtract the total down payment from the total cost: $1000 - $220 = $780\n4. Divide the remaining balance by the number of months Tara wants to pay for (4): $780 / 4 = $195\nTherefore, Tara's balance after paying for 4 months will be $195.\nI hope it is correct: 195",
        "ground_truth": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200>>200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $<<1000-220=780>>780.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $<<780/12=65>>65/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $<<65*4=260>>260.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $<<780-260=520>>520.\n#### 520"
