At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA plumber is trying to decide which of three different jobs he should take to make the most money.  The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks at an apartment complex.  The second involves two toilets and five sinks at a different apartment complex.  The third involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks at a third apartment complex.  If the plumber charges $30 to fix a sink, $40 to fix a shower and $50 to fix a toilet, what is the most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs?",
        "inference": "1. The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks, so the total cost would be: 3 x $50 + 3 x $30 = $150 + $90 = $240.\n2. The second job involves fixing two toilets and five sinks, so the total cost would be: 2 x $50 + 5 x $30 = $100 + $150 = $250.\n3. The third job involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks, so the total cost would be: 1 x $50 + 2 x $40 + 3 x $30 = $50 + $80 + $90 = $220.\n\nSo, the most money the plumber can earn is $250.\n\nI hope it is correct: The most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs is $250.",
        "ground_truth": "If the plumber chooses the first job, he would earn 3*50 + 3*30 = $<<3*50+3*30=240>>240.\nIf he chooses the second, he'd earn 2*50 + 5*30 = $<<2*50+5*30=250>>250.\nIf he chooses the third, he'd earn 50 + 2*40 + 3*30 = $<<50+2*40+3*30=220>>220.\nTherefore, the most money he can earn from one of these jobs is $<<250=250>>250.\n#### 250"
