        "inference": "Let's call the length of Samantha's last name \"x\". \n\nWe know that Bobbie's last name has three more letters than Samantha's, so it has \"x + 3\" letters. \n\nIf Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have \"(x + 3) - 2 = x + 1\" letters left. \n\nWe also know that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, it would be twice the length of Jamie's last name. Jamie's last name is \"Grey\", which has five letters. So, \"x + 1 = 2 * 5 = 10\". \n\nSolving for \"x\", we get x = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\n> I hope it is correct: 9",
