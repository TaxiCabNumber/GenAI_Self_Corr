She gets 6 client requests every day and works on four of them each day. How many client requests will she have remaining to work on after 5 days.",

We know she gets 6 client requests every day, so we can multiply 6 by 5 to find out how many client requests she gets in 5 days. 6 * 5 = 30\n2. Next, we need to find out how many client requests Maia works on each day. We know she works on four of them each day, so we can multiply 4 by 5 to find out how many client requests she works on in 5 days. 4 * 5 = 20\n3. Finally, we can subtract the number of client requests Maia works on in 5 days from the number of client requests she gets in 5 days to find out how many client requests she will have remaining to work on after 5 days. 30 - 20 = 10\nI hope it is correct: 10",
