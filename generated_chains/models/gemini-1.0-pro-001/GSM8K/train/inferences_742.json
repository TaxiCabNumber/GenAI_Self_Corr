At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBrendan can cut 8 yards of grass per day, he bought a lawnmower and it helped him to cut more yards by Fifty percent per day. How many yards will Brendan be able to cut after a week?",
        "inference": "1. **First, find out how many yards Brendan can cut with the lawnmower.**\n\nWe know that he can cut 8 yards per day, and the lawnmower helps him to cut 50% more yards.\n\n50% more yards means 8 * 1.5 = 12 yards per day.\n\n2. **Next, find out how many days Brendan will be cutting grass in a week.**\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so Brendan will be cutting grass for 7 days.\n\n3. **Finally, multiply the number of yards Brendan can cut per day by the number of days he will be cutting grass.**\n\n12 yards per day * 7 days = 84 yards\n\nI hope it is correct: 84",
        "ground_truth": "The additional yard Brendan can cut after buying the lawnmower is 8 x 0.50 = <<8*0.50=4>>4 yards.\nSo, the total yards he can cut with the lawnmower is 8 + 4 = <<8+4=12>>12.\nTherefore, the total number of yards he can cut in a week is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 yards.\n#### 84"
