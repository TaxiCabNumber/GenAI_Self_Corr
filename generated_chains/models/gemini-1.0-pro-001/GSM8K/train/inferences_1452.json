An hour later Alice leaves from the same point for the same destination, traveling 40 miles per hour. How much earlier does Abel reach the destination in minutes??",

It will take her 50 miles / 40 miles per hour = 1.25 hours to catch up to Abel.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take Alice 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes to reach the destination.  Abel will reach the destination 75 minutes earlier.\n\nI hope it is correct: 75 minutes.",
