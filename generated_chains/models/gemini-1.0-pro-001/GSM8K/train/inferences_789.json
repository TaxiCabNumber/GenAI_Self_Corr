At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames hurt himself exercising.  The pain subsided after 3 days, but he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal. After that, he wanted to wait another 3 days before he started working out again.  If he wants to wait 3 weeks after that to start lifting heavy again, how long until he can lift heavy again?",
        "inference": "3 days to recover from the pain + 5 (3 days) = 15 days to heal + 3 days to rest before working out = 18 days to start working out again + 3 weeks = 24 days total\n\nI hope it is correct: 24 days",
        "ground_truth": "The injury would be fully healed after 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 days\nSo he would start exercising again in 15+3=<<15+3=18>>18 days\nHe would then wait for 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 more days to start lifting heavy again\nThat means he needs to wait 18+21=<<18+21=39>>39 days\n#### 39"
