At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJeff spends three times as many hours on the weekend catching up with his Facebook pals as he does working. Monday through Friday, however, he spends four times as many hours working as he does catching up. If he spends 3 hours every day catching up, how many hours does he spend working in an entire week?",
