At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of toys Bill has B. We know that Hash has 9 more than half as many toys as Bill has, so the number of toys Hash has is H = 1/2 * B + 9. We are told that Bill has 60 toys, so B = 60. Substituting this into the equation for H, we get H = 1/2 * 60 + 9 = 30 + 9 = 39. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has and the number of toys Hash has: Total = B + H = 60 + 39 = 99.\nI hope it is correct: 99",
        "ground_truth": "First we need to know what half of Bills toys are, 60 toys / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 toys.\nHash has 9 toys + 30 toys = <<9+30=39>>39 toys.\nTogether the boys have 60 toys + 39 toys = <<60+39=99>>99 toys.\n#### 99"
