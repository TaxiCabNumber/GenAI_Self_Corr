At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nVictor works at Clucks Delux, a restaurant specializing in chicken. An order of Chicken Pasta uses 2 pieces of chicken, an order of Barbecue Chicken uses 3 pieces of chicken, and a family-size Fried Chicken Dinner uses 8 pieces of chicken. Tonight, Victor has 2 Fried Chicken Dinner orders, 6 Chicken Pasta orders, and 3 Barbecue Chicken orders. How many pieces of chicken does he need for all the orders?",
