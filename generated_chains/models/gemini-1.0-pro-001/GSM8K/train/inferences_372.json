At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTJ ran a 10K race last Saturday. He ran the first half in 20 minutes. He completed the second half in 30 minutes. What was his average time per kilometer?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the time taken for each half to hours.\n\n* First half: 20 minutes = 20/60 = 1/3 hour\n\n\n* Second half: 30 minutes = 30/60 = 1/2 hour\n\n**Step 2:** Add the times taken for both halves to get the total time taken.\n\n* Total time = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 hour\n\n**Step 3:** Convert the distance (10K) to kilometers.\n\n* 10K = 10,000 meters = 10 kilometers\n\n**Step 4:** Divide the total time taken by the total distance to get the average time per kilometer.\n\n* Average time per kilometer = 5/6 hour / 10 kilometers = 1/12 hour/kilometer = **5 minutes per kilometer**\n\nI hope it is correct: 5 minutes per kilometer",
        "ground_truth": "He ran the 10 kilometers in a total of 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.\nTherefore, he ran at a pace of 50 minutes / 10 kilometers = <<50/10=5>>5 minutes per kilometer.\n#### 5"
