At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nStella wanted to buy a new dress for the upcoming dance.  At the store she found out that the dress she wanted was $50.  The store was offering 30% off of everything in the store.  What was the final cost of the dress?",
        "inference": "- First, we need to find the discount that Stella will receive. \n- To do this, we will multiply the original price of the dress ($50) by the discount rate (30% or 0.3). \n- This gives us a discount of $15 ($50 x 0.3 = $15).\n- Next, we need to subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost. \n- This gives us a final cost of $35 ($50 - $15 = $35). \n\nI hope it is correct: $35",
