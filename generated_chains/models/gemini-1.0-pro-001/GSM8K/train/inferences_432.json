        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTina is getting $20 for each book she sells. If she realizes a $120 profit on her sales, how many people have she sold the books to if each book costs $5 to make and every customer buys 2 at a time?",
        "inference": "First, let me find out how much money Tina has made from selling the books. I am told she made a profit of $120, and books cost her $5 each to make. So, I'll need to add the $120 to the cost of the books, which would be 5 times the number of books she sold, which is unknown and let's call it x. So, 5x + 120 = total earnings from selling the books. \n\nNext, I am given that she sells two books to each customer. So, the number of customers she has sold the books to is half of the number of books she sold, which is x/2. \n\nNow I can set up a proportion: total earnings from selling the books / number of customers = $20 (the amount Tina gets for each book she sells). So, (5x + 120) / (x/2) = 20. \n\nI can solve for x by cross-multiplying: 5x + 120 = 20 * (x/2). \n\n5x + 120 = 10x.\n\n120 = 5x.\n\nx = 24. \n\nSo, Tina has sold the books to 24 / 2 = 12 customers, considering each customer buys 2 books at a time. I hope it is correct: 12",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to determine the profit per book. To do this, we perform 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 dollars in profit per book.\nNext, we divide the total sales by the profit per book, performing 120/15=<<120/15=8>>8 books sold in total.\nSince the books are sold 2 at a time, we divide the number sold by 2 to find the total number of people sold to, performing 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 people in total.\n#### 4"
