At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Sanchez found out that 40% of his Grade 5  students got a final grade below B. How many of his students got a final grade of B and above if he has 60 students in Grade 5?",
        "inference": "40% of 60 students is 0.4 * 60 = 24 students.\nTherefore, 60 - 24 = 36 students got a final grade of B and above.\nI hope it is correct: 36",
