        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLucille is painting her room. Two of her walls are 3 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The third wall is 5 meters wide and 2 meters tall. The final wall is 4 meters wide and 2 meters tall. If each can of paint covers 2 square meters, how many cans of paint does Lucille need?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the area of each wall:\n\u2022 Wall 1: 3m x 2m = 6 square meters\n\u2022 Wall 2: 3m x 2m = 6 square meters\n\u2022 Wall 3: 5m x 2m = 10 square meters\n\u2022 Wall 4: 4m x 2m = 8 square meters\n\n2. Add the areas of all the walls:\n6 square meters + 6 square meters + 10 square meters + 8 square meters = 30 square meters\n\n3. Divide the total area by the area covered by each can of paint:\n30 square meters / 2 square meters per can = 15 cans of paint\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
        "ground_truth": "For the first set of walls, each wall covers 3 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<3*2=6>>6 square meters.\nThere are two of these walls, so this becomes a total of 6 meters * 2 walls = <<6*2=12>>12 square meters.\nThe third wall covers 5 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<5*2=10>>10 square meters.\nThe final wall covers 4 meters wide * 2 meters tall = <<4*2=8>>8 square meters.\nSo in total, the paint needs to cover 12 + 10 + 8 = <<12+10+8=30>>30 metres.\nSince each can covers 2 meters, Lucille needs 30 meters / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 cans of paint.\n#### 15"
