For every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, and one-quarter of the brown toads are spotted.  If there are 50 spotted brown toads per acre, how many green toads are there per acre?",

For every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, so there are 200 / 25 = 8 green toads per acre.\n\nI hope it is correct: 8 toads per acre",
