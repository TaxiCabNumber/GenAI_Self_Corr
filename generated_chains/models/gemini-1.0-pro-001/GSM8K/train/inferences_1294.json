At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo get to an island called \"Virgo\", Tom needs to travel by plane and then by boat. The plane trip is four times longer than the boat trip, and the boat trip takes up to 2 hours. In how many hours is Tom able to get to the \"Virgo\" island?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the time taken by the boat trip.\n\nThen, the time taken by the plane trip is $4x$.\n\nTotal time taken = Time taken by boat trip + Time taken by plane trip\n= $x + 4x = 5x$\n\nIt is given that the boat trip takes up to 2 hours, so $x \\leq 2$.\n\nTherefore, the total time taken to get to the \"Virgo\" island is $5x \\leq 5(2) = 10$ hours.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 10**",
        "ground_truth": "The plane trip is four times longer than the 2-hour long boat trip, which means it takes 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours.\nSo in total, the whole journey to \"Virgo\" islands lasts 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 hours.\n#### 10"
