At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKimberly went strawberry picking with her family over the weekend. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?",

Find the number of strawberries Kimberly picked: $45 \\times 8 = 360$ strawberries.\n3. Find the total number of strawberries Kimberly's parents picked: $360 - 93 = 267$ strawberries.\n4. Find the total number of strawberries they picked: $45 + 360 + 267 = 672$ strawberries.\n5. Find the number of strawberries each person would have if they divided the total number equally: $672 \\div 4 = 168$ strawberries.\n\n**Answer**\nI hope it is correct: 168",
