At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Friday, Remy paid Sally\u2019s Woodworking LLC a total of $20,700 for 150 pieces of furniture. Later that evening, the company\u2019s accountant discovered that a new intern in the sales department had overcharged Remy.
