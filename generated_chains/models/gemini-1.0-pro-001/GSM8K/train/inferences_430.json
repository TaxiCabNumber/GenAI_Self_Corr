At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTanya went to the grocery store to buy some fruit.  She bought 6 pears, 4 Granny Smith apples, 2 pineapples, and a small basket of plums, which were all placed in a single paper bag.  Unfortunately, the bag that the fruit had been placed in had developed a hole.  Therefore, as Tanya walked home, half of the fruit fell out of the bag.  When she later counted the fruit left in the bag, there were only 9 pieces remaining.  How many plums did she buy?",
        "inference": "- Total fruit pieces: 6 + 4 + 2 + x\n= 12 + x \n\n- Half of the fruit pieces dropped: (6 + 4 + 2 + x)/2\n\n- There were 9 pieces remaining: 12 + x - (6 + 4 + 2 + x)/2 = 9\n\n- Simplify the equation: 12 + x - (12 + x)/2 = 9\n\n- 12 + x - 6 - x = 9\n6 = 9, which is not true. It means there is no solution for 'x', the number of plums Tanya bought.\n\nI hope it is correct: None$",
        "ground_truth": "If half of the fruit equals 9 pieces, then Tanya bought 2*9=<<2*9=18>>18 pieces of fruit.\nThus, Tanya bought 18-6-4-2=<<18-6-4-2=6>>6 plums.\n#### 6"
