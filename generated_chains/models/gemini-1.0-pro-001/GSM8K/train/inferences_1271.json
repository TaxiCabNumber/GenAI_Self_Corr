At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDorothy is 15 years old and wants to go to a museum with her family. Her family consists of her, her younger brother, her parents, and her grandfather. The regular ticket cost is $10. People 18 years old or younger have a discount of 30%. How much money will Dorothy have after this trip, when she currently has $70?",
        "inference": "First, I must calculate the discount for Dorothy and her brother. Since they both are less than 18 years old, they would receive a 30% discount. \nSo, the 30% discount for Dorothy and her brother is 0.3 * 10 = $3 off the regular price of $10 per ticket. \n\nNext, I will calculate the total cost if everyone paid full price.\nDorothy, her brother, her parents, and her grandfather will buy tickets, so a total of 5 people will be buying tickets.\nSo, 5 * $10 = $50\n\nI then subtract the discount received by Dorothy and her brother to get the actual cost or amount to be paid by the family.\nThat is, $50 - $3 = $47\n\nFinally, I subtract the total cost of the ticket from the amount Dorothy has to find out how much she will have after this trip.\nThat is, $70 - $47 = $23\nI hope it is correct: $23",
        "ground_truth": "The discount per one ticket is 10 * 30/100 = $<<10*30/100=3>>3.\nSo Dorothy's and her brother's tickets are cheaper by 2 * 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.\nHer family consists of 5 people, so the ticket cost stands at 5 * 10 = $<<5*10=50>>50.\nIncluding the discount will lower the price to 50 - 6 = $<<50-6=44>>44 in total.\nDorothy will be left with 70 - 44 = $<<70-44=26>>26.\n#### 26"
