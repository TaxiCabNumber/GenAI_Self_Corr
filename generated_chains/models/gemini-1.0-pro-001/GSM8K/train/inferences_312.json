At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFarmer Brown raises emus, large birds. His flock has a total of 60 heads and legs. How many emus are in his flock?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of emus.\n\nEach emu has one head, so the total number of heads is x.\n\nEach emu has two legs, so the total number of legs is 2x.\n\nThe total number of heads and legs is given as 60, so we have the equation:\n\nx + 2x = 60\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n3x = 60\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nx = 20\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
        "ground_truth": "Each emu has 1+2=<<1+2=3>>3 heads and legs.\nThen the flock has 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 animals.\n#### 20"
