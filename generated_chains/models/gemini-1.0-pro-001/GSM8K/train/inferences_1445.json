At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJenny wants to read 3 books in the next 10 days. She can read 100 words per hour. If the first book has 200 words, the second book has 400 words, and the third book has 300 words, how many minutes per day, on average, should she spend reading?",
