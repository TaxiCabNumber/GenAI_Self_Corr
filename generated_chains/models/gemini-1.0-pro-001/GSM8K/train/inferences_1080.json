At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn the engineering department, 70% of the students are men and 180 are women. How many men are there?",
        "inference": "1) Assume the total number of students in the department is \"x\". \n2) 70% of the students are men, which means 100% - 70% = 30% of them are women. \n3) We know that 180 students are women, so 30% of \"x\" is equal to 180. \n\n4) Putting in the values, we get 30/100 * x = 180\n5) Solving for x, we get x = (180 * 100) / 30 = 600. \n\n**6) Therefore, the total number of students in the department is 600 and since 70% of them are men, there are 600 * 70/100 = 420 men.\n\nI hope it is correct: 420",
        "ground_truth": "The percentage for women is 100% - 70% = 30%.\nSince 180 represents 30%, then 180/30 = 6 students represent 1%.\nHence, 6 x 70 = <<6*70=420>>420 students are men.\n#### 420"
