Kobe ordered five pieces of fried chicken, and Pau ordered twice as much fried chicken as Kobe did. If they order another set of fried chicken, how many pieces of fried chicken will Pau have eaten in all?",

Total pieces of chicken ordered so far: 5 + 10 = 15\n4. If they order another set of fried chicken, the total number of pieces ordered will be 15 + 5 = 20\n5. Pau will have eaten half of the total number of pieces, which is 20 / 2 = 10 pieces\n\nI hope it is correct: 10",
