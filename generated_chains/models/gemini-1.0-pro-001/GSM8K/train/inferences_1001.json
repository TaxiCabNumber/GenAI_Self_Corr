At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA plant supplier was able to sell 20 pieces of orchids for $50 each and 15 pieces potted Chinese money plant for $25. The money he earned was then used to pay his two workers $40 each and to buy new pots worth $150. How much money was left from the plant supplier's earnings?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Orchids: 20 pieces * $50 = $1,000\n2. Money Plants: 15 pieces * $25 = $375\n3. Total Earnings: $1,000 + $375 = $1,375\n4. Total Expenses: $40 + $40 + $150 = $230\n5. Money Left: $1,375 - $230 = $1,145\n\n**Answer:** I hope it is correct: $1,145",
        "ground_truth": "The plant supplier earned $50 x 20 = $<<50*20=1000>>1000 for the orchids.\nHe earned $25 x 15 = $<<25*15=375>>375 for the potted Chinese money plants.\nSo, his total earnings was $1000 + $375 = $<<1000+375=1375>>1375.\nThen he paid $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 to his workers.\nHe used a total of $80 + $150 = $<<80+150=230>>230 for the worker's pay and new pots.\nHence, he was left with $1375 - $230 = $<<1145=1145>>1145 from his earnings.\n#### 1145"
