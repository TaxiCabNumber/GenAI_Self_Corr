At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAt Esme's school, there are 30 teachers and 45 staff members. On a Monday morning, The Best Pizza Inn brought pizza for the staff and teachers as a promotion offer. If 2/3 of the teachers and 4/5 of the staff members ate Pizza, how many non-pizza eaters are at Esme's school?",
