At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhile Greg was camping with his family for a week, it rained for 3 days. When he looked at the weather records, he saw that the amount of rain was 3 mm, 6 mm, and 5 mm on the three days. During the same week, it rained 26 mm at his house. How much less rain did Greg experience while camping?",
        "inference": "1. Add the amount of rain that fell on each of the three days while Greg was camping: 3 mm + 6 mm + 5 mm = 14 mm.\n\n2. Subtract the amount of rain that fell while Greg was camping from the amount of rain that fell at his house: 26 mm - 14 mm = 12 mm.\n\nI hope it is correct: 12 mm",
