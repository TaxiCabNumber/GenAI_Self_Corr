At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWendi brought home 4 chickens.  After a few days, she brought home enough additional chickens to double the number of chickens she owned.  Then, a neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens.  Finally, Wendi found an additional 4 less than ten chickens and brought them home too.  After this, how many chickens does Wendi have?",
        "inference": "1. Wendi started with 4 chickens.\n2. She then doubled the number of chickens she owned by bringing home additional chickens. So, she had 4 * 2 = 8 chickens.\n3. A neighbor's dog ate one of her chickens, so she had 8 - 1 = 7 chickens.\n4. Finally, Wendi found an additional 4 less than ten chickens and brought them home too. So, she found 10 - 4 = 6 chickens and brought them home.\n5. Therefore, Wendi has 7 + 6 = 13 chickens.\n\nI hope it is correct: 13",
        "ground_truth": "Wendi doubled her number of chickens from 4 to 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 chickens.\nAfter a dog ate one of the chickens, 8-1=<<8-1=7>>7 chickens remained.\n4 less than 10 is 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6.\nTherefore, Wendi added another 4 less than ten chickens for a total of 7+6=13 chickens.\n#### 13"
