At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarrie wants to buy a new iPhone. The new iPhone costs $800. She can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. She can make $80 per week babysitting. How many weeks does she have to work before she can purchase the iPhone?",
