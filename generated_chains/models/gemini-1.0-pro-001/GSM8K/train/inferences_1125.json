At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSharon wants to get kitchen supplies. She admired Angela's kitchen supplies which consist of 20 pots, 6 more than three times as many plates as the pots, and half as many cutlery as the plates. Sharon wants to buy half as many pots as Angela, 20 less than three times as many plates as Angela, and twice as much cutlery as Angela. What is the total number of kitchen supplies Sharon wants to buy?",
        "inference": "1. Angela's kitchen supplies:\n- Pots: 20\n- Plates: 6 more than three times as many pots = 3 * 20 + 6 = 66\n- Cutlery: half as many plates = 66 / 2 = 33\n\n2. Sharon's kitchen supplies:\n- Pots: half as many pots as Angela = 20 / 2 = 10\n- Plates: 20 less than three times as many plates as Angela = 3 * 66 - 20 = 180\n- Cutlery: twice as much cutlery as Angela = 33 * 2 = 66\n\n3.
