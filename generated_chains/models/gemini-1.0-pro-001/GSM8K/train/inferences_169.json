At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBorris liquor store uses 90 kilograms of grapes every 6 months. He is thinking of increasing his production by twenty percent. How many grapes does he need in a year after increasing his production?",
        "inference": "1. **Calculate the current amount of grapes used in a year:**\n\nCurrent grapes used in 6 months = 90 kg\nCurrent grapes used in 1 year = 90 kg * 2 = 180 kg\n\n2. **Calculate the percentage increase:**\n\nPercentage increase = 20%\n\n3. **Calculate the increased amount of grapes used in a year:**\n\nIncreased grapes used in 1 year = 180 kg * (1 + 20/100) = 216 kg\n\n**Answer:**\n\nI hope it is correct: 216",
        "ground_truth": "Borris uses 90 x 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 kilograms of grapes per year.\nThe increase of kilograms of grapes he needed per year is 180 x 0.20 = <<180*0.20=36>>36.\nTherefore, Borris needs 180 + 36 = <<180+36=216>>216 kilograms of grapes in a year.\n#### 216"
