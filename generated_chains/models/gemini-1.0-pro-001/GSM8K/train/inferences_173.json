At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark has two pets, a hare that runs 10 feet/second and a turtle that crawls 1 foot/second. If they're going to run a 20 foot-race, how much of a head start (in seconds) does the turtle need to finish in a tie?",
        "inference": "The hare runs 10 feet/second, so it will take him 2 seconds to run 20 feet.\nThe turtle runs 1 foot/second, so it will take him 20 seconds to run 20 feet.\nTo finish in a tie, the turtle needs a head start of 20 - 2 = 18 seconds.\nI hope it is correct: 18 seconds",
        "ground_truth": "We can find how long the hare spends running by dividing the distance of the race by the hare's speed: 20 feet / 10 feet/second = <<20/10=2>>2 seconds\nWe can do the same for the turtle: 20 feet / 1 foot/second = <<20/1=20>>20 seconds\nFinally, subtract the hare's run time from the turtle's run time to find the length of the head start the turtle needs: 20 seconds - 2 seconds = <<20-2=18>>18 seconds\n#### 18"
