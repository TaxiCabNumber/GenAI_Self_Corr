At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMaria wants to paint a picture and needs some tools to do that. She wants to buy a set of brushes for $20 and some canvas for three times more than the brushes. The paint costs Maria $8 per liter, and she needs at least 5 liters. How much money will she earn on the painting if she will be able to sell it for $200?",
        "inference": "1. Brushes cost $20\n2. Canvas costs three times more than the brushes, so it costs $3 * 20 = $60\n3. Paint costs $8 per liter and she needs at least 5 liters, so it costs $8 * 5 = $40\n4. Total cost of materials: $20 + $60 + $40 = $120\n5. Profit on the painting: $200 - $120 = $80\n\nI hope it is correct: $80",
        "ground_truth": "Maria wants to pay 3 * 20 = $<<3*20=60>>60 for the canvas.\nMaria needs 5 liters of paint, so the cost of it would be 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo in total Maria will earn 200 - 40 - 60 - 20 = $<<200-40-60-20=80>>80 if she will be able to sell the painting at the mentioned price.\n#### 80"
