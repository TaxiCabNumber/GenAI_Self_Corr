At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe age difference between Asaf and Alexander's age is half the total number of pencils Asaf has. The sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old. If Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf, calculate the total number of pencils they have together.",

This means that the number of pencils Asaf has is twice the difference between their ages.\n2) The sum of their ages is 140, and Asaf is 50 years old. This means that Alexander is 140 - 50 = 90 years old.\n3) Alexander has 60 more pencils than Asaf. This means that Alexander has 60 + 2 * (the difference between their ages) pencils, while Asaf has 2 * (the difference between their ages) pencils.\n4) We can now set up an equation to find the difference between their ages:\n60 + 2 * (the difference between their ages) = 2 * (the difference between their ages) + 90\n60 = 90\nThis is a contradiction, which means that there is no solution to the problem.\nI hope it's correct: No solution",
