At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJimmy is going to sell pizzas at the carnival to make some money. The carnival only gave him 7 hours to do so. He bought a 22kg sack of flour to make his pizzas and he takes 10 min to make each pizza for the customers. At the end of the 7 hours, he saw some flour was left. Knowing that each pizza needs 0.5kg of flour to make, how many pizzas can he make to bring home with the flour left?",
        "inference": "**1. Convert 7 hours to minutes:**\n7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes\n\n**2. Calculate how many minutes Jimmy has left after making pizzas:**\n420 minutes - (10 minutes/pizza * number of pizzas)\n\n**3. Convert the remaining flour to kg:**\n22 kg * remaining minutes / 420 minutes = remaining flour (in kg)\n\n**4. Calculate how many pizzas Jimmy can make with the remaining flour:**\nremaining flour (in kg) / 0.5 kg/pizza = number of pizzas\n\n**5. Subtract the number of pizzas sold from the total pizzas made:**\ntotal pizzas made - number of pizzas sold = number of pizzas to bring home\n\nI hope it is correct: 6 $pizzas$",
