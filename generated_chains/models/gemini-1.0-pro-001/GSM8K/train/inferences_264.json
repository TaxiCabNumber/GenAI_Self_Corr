At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn Italian restaurant earns $600 every weekday and twice as much on the weekend. How much money does it earn by the end of the month?",

        "ground_truth": "On weekdays it earns $600/weekday * 5 weekdays = $<<600*5=3000>>3000\nDuring the weekend it earns twice as much each day so it makes ($600 * 2)/weekend day * 2 weekend days = $<<(600*2)*2=2400>>2400\nEvery week it earns $3000 + $2400 = $<<3000+2400=5400>>5400\nBy the end of the month, it earns $5400/week * 4 weeks = $21600\n#### 21600"
