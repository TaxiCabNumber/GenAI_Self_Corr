At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA couple with two children, ages 6 and 10 years old, decided to go to an amusement park. The regular ticket costs $109, but children below 12 years old have a $5 discount. If they gave the cashier $500, how much change will they receive?",

        "ground_truth": "The ticket costs 109 - 5 = $<<109-5=104>>104 for each child.\nSo the ticket cost of the two children is 104 x 2 = $<<104*2=208>>208.\nThe couple needs to pay the regular price, so it's 109 x 2 = $<<109*2=218>>218.\nThus, the family needs to pay a total of 208 + 218 = $<<208+218=426>>426.\nTherefore, their change is 500 - 426 = $<<500-426=74>>74.\n#### 74"
