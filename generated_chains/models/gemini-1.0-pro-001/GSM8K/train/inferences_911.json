At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt took an alligator named Paul 4 hours to walk from his home at the River Nile to the Nile Delta.  On the return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, the journey taking 2 more hours than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, to reach their home at the River Nile. What's the combined time the alligators walked?",
        "inference": "The return journey took 2 hours more than Paul took to walk to the Nile Delta, so the return journey took 4 + 2 = 6 hours. The combined time the alligators walked is the sum of the time it took Paul to walk to the Nile Delta (4 hours) and the time it took them to return home (6 hours), which is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.\nI hope it is correct: 10",
        "ground_truth": "If on the return journey to its home, the alligator took 2 more hours than it took to travel to the Nile Delta, Paul took 4+2=<<4+2=6>>6 hours to travel back to its home.\nThe total time Paul took to travel from its home to the Nile Delta and back is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10\nOn his return journey, Paul traveled with six other alligators, and since each alligator traveled for six hours up the Nile to their home, they took a total of 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 hours to do so.\nTogether with Paul, all the alligators took 10+36=<<10+36=46>>46 hours traveling between Nile Delta and up the Nile.\n#### 46"
