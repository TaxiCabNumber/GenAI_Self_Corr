At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSarah, Mary, and Tuan decided to go to the restaurant for a meal. They decided to split the cost of the meal evenly. If the total price of the meal comes to $67 and they have a coupon for $4, how much does each person need to contribute to the bill?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the meal after the coupon is applied: $67 - $4 = $63\n\n2. Divide the total cost of the meal by the number of people to find the amount each person needs to contribute: $63 / 3 = $21\n\nI hope it is correct: 21",
        "ground_truth": "After using the coupon, the final price comes to 67 - 4 = <<67-4=63>>63 dollars.\nWith three people, they each need to pay 63 / 3 = <<63/3=21>>21 dollars each.\n#### 21"
