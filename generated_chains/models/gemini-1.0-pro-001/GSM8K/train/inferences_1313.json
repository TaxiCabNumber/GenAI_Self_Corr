At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrank is walking through a corn maze. He has already spent 45 minutes inside. He has done 4 other corn mazes and finished those in 50 minutes on average. How much longer can he spend inside if he wants to ensure that his average doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze?",
        "inference": "1. Frank has already spent 45 minutes in the current maze.\n2. He has spent 4 * 50 minutes = 200 minutes in the previous mazes.\n3. His total time spent in the mazes so far is 45 + 200 = 245 minutes.\n4. He wants to ensure that his average doesn't go above 60 minutes per maze.\n5. So, he can spend a total of 5 * 60 = 300 minutes in all the mazes.\n6. He has already spent 245 minutes.\n7. Therefore, he can spend 300 - 245 = 55 more minutes in the current maze.\nI hope it is correct: 55 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "He needs to keep his total time at 300 or below because 5 x 60 = <<5*60=300>>300\nHis total time spent in the other mazes is 200 because 4 x 50 = <<4*50=200>>200\nHis total time spent in the five mazes thus far is 245 because 200 + 45 = <<200+45=245>>245\nHe can spend 55 more minutes on this maze before his average go above 60 because 300 - 245 = <<300-245=55>>55\n#### 55"
