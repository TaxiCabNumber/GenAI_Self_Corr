At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThree cats sat on a fence, meowing at the moon.  The first cat meowed 3 times per minute.  The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the first cat.  And the third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat.  What is the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes?",
        "inference": "First, find the number of meows each cat makes in 5 minutes:\n- The first cat meows 3 times per minute, so in 5 minutes it will meow 3 * 5 = 15 times.\n- The second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat, so in 5 minutes it will meow 2 * 15 = 30 times.\n- The third cat meows at one-third the frequency of the second cat, so in 5 minutes it will meow 1/3 * 30 = 10 times.\n\nNext, add up the number of meows each cat makes to find the total number of meows:\n15 + 30 + 10 = 55\n\nI hope it is correct: 55",
        "ground_truth": "The second cat meowed twice as frequently as the three meows per minute from the first cat, for a total of 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 meows per minute.\nThe third cat meowed at one-third the frequency of the second cat, for a total of 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 meows per minute.\nThus, combined, the three cats meow 3+6+2=<<3+6+2=11>>11 times per minute.\nIn five minutes, the three cats meow 5*11=<<5*11=55>>55 times.\n#### 55"
