The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. Roger has 13 members on his baseball team, plus 3 coaches and 2 helpers. How many packs of trail mix does he need to buy?",

Determine how many individual pouches of trail mix Roger needs:\nTotal pouches needed = Total people x Number of pouches per pack\nTotal pouches needed = 18 people x 6 pouches per pack = 108 pouches\n\n3. Determine the number of packs of trail mix Roger needs:\nNumber of packs needed = Total pouches needed / Number of pouches per pack\nNumber of packs needed = 108 pouches / 6 pouches per pack = 18 packs\n\nI hope it is correct: 18 packs",
