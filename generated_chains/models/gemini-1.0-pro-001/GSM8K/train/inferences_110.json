The candy bars cost $2 each.  Marvin sold 35 candy bars total.  Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.  How much more money did Tina make for the class trip selling candy bars compared to Marvin?",

Tina sold 105 candy bars that cost $2 each, so she made 105 * $2 = $210.\n4. Tina made $210 - $70 = $140 more money than Marvin for the class trip selling candy bars.\nI hope it is correct: $140",
