At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames buys $3000 worth of stuff from Amazon.  He has to return a TV that cost $700 and a bike that cost $500.  He also sells another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  He then buys a toaster for $100.  How much is he out of pocket for everything?",

He sold another bike that cost 20% more than the bike he returned for 80% of what he bought it for.  The bike he returned cost $500, so the bike he sold cost $500 x 1.20 = $600.  He sold it for 80% of $600, so he got back $600 x 0.80 = $480.\n\n4. He then bought a toaster for $100.\n\n5. So, in total, he spent $3000 and got back $1200 + $480 = $1680.\n\n6.
