At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelanie is making meatballs for dinner. The recipe calls for breadcrumbs. To make the breadcrumbs Melanie is going to tear 2 slices of bread into smaller pieces and then add them to a blender to grind them into fine crumbs. First she tears the bread slices each in half, then tears those halves in half. How many bread pieces is Melanie going to put into the blender?",
        "inference": "1. Melanie tore each bread slice in half: 2 slices x 2 halves = 4 pieces\n2. Melanie tore each of those halves in half: 4 pieces x 2 halves = 8 pieces\nI hope it is correct: $8$",
        "ground_truth": "Melanie starts with 1 slice of bread that she tears in half, making 2 halves.\nShe takes both of those halves and tears them each in half, 2 halves x 2 more halves in half = <<2*2=4>>4 pieces per slice of bread.\nMelanie is using 2 slices of bread x 4 pieces each = <<2*4=8>>8 pieces overall to add to the blender.\n#### 8"
