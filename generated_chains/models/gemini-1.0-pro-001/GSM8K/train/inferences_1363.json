At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPrudence was starting a cupcake business.  She figured that each cupcake cost $0.75 to make.  The first 2 dozen that she made burnt and she had to throw them out.  The next 2 came out perfectly and she ended up eating 5 cupcakes right away.  Later that day she made 2 more dozen cupcakes and decided to eat 4 more. If she sells the remaining cupcakes at $2.00 each, how much is her net profit?",

        "ground_truth": "She burnt 2 dozen, cooked 2 dozen and then another 2 dozen that evening. So she made 2+2+2 =<<2+2+2=6>>6 dozen cupcakes\nEach dozen makes 12 cupcakes, so she made 6*12= <<6*12=72>>72 cupcakes\nShe threw away 2 dozen cupcakes, so 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cupcakes\nShe made 72, threw away 24, ate 5 and then ate another 4 so she had 72-24-5-4 = <<72-24-5-4=39>>39 cupcakes left\nShe sells the 39 cupcakes at $2.00 each so she earned 39*2 = $<<39*2=78.00>>78.00\nShe made 72 cupcakes at a cost of $0.75 each for a total cost of 72*$0.75 = $<<72*0.75=54.00>>54.00\nIf she made $78 on the remaining cupcakes and it cost her $54.00 to make all of the cupcakes then her profit is $78-$54 = $<<78-54=24.00>>24.00\n#### 24"
