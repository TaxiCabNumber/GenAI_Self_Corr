Since the temperature will decrease to 3/4 of its current temperature, the decrease will be by the fraction 1 - 3/4 = 1/4. Now, we know that the current temperature is 84 degrees, so the decrease in temperature will be 1/4 of 84 degrees, which is 1/4 * 84 = 21 degrees.\nI hope it is correct: The temperature will decrease by 21 degrees $21$",
