At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA trader made a profit of $960 after a week of sales. To raise $610 to pay for her next shipment of wares, she splits the profit in half and solicits donations from her family and friends. If she received a total donation of $310 and adds it to one-half of her profit, how much money did she make above her goal?",

She split it in half, so she has $960/2 = $480.\n\n**Step 2**: She received a donation of $310, so she now has $480 + $310 = $790.\n\n**Step 3**: Her goal was to raise $610, so she is $790 - $610 = $180 above her goal.\nI hope it is correct: $180$",
