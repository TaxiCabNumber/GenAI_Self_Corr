During one hour the bakery can make 12 pies. Creating one pie costs the bakery $0.5. Considering the bakery would be able to sell all pie pieces, how much money would it make?",

So, the bakery makes 36 * $4 = $144 per hour.\nThe bakery spends $0.50 to make each pie. So, the bakery spends 12 * $0.50 = $6 per hour.\nThe bakery's profit is the difference between what it makes and what it spends.\nSo, the bakery's profit is $144 - $6 = $138 per hour.\n\nI hope it is correct: 138",
