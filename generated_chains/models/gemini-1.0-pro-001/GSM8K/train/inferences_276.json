At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSabrina went to the library and found a historical series novel called The Rangers Apprentice. There are 14 books in the series, and each book has 200 pages. She read four books in a month and half the number of books remaining in the second month. What's the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the whole series?",
