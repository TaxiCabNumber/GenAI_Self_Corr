At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt's Yvette's turn to treat herself and her three best friends to a round of ice cream sundaes.  Alicia orders the peanut butter sundae for $7.50.  Brant orders the Royal banana split sundae for $10.00.  Josh orders the death by chocolate sundae for $8.50 and Yvette orders the cherry jubilee sundae for $9.00.  She leaves her waiter a 20% tip.  How much will her final bill be?",
