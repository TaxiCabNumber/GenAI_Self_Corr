At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlice has 20 quarters. She wants to exchange them for nickels and so she goes to the bank. After getting back from the bank, she discovers that 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. What is the total value of her money now?",
        "inference": "1. Alice has 20 quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so she has a total of 20 * 25 = 500 cents.\n\n2. She exchanges all of her quarters for nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so she will get 500 / 5 = 100 nickels.\n\n3. 20% of her nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. So, she has 100 * 0.20 = 20 iron nickels.\n\n4. The total value of her iron nickels is 20 * $3 = $60.\n\n5. The total value of her remaining (non-iron) nickels is 100 - 20 = 80 nickels. Each non-iron nickel is worth 5 cents, so the total value of her non-iron nickels is 80 * 5 = $4.\n\n6. Therefore, the total value of her money now is $60 + $4 = $64.\nI hope it is correct: $64",
