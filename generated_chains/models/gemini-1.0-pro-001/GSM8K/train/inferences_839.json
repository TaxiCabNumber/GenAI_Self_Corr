        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?",
        "inference": "Let's calculate the total number of omelets needed for each group:\n- Small children: 53 * 0.5 = 26.5 omelets\n- Older children: 35 * 1 = 35 omelets\n- Adults: 75 * 2 = 150 omelets\n- Seniors: 37 * 1.5 = 55.5 omelets\n\nThen, we add these values: 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 omelets.\n\nFinally, we add 25 extra omelets: 267 + 25 = 292 omelets.\n\nSince each omelet uses 2 eggs, the total number of eggs needed is: 292 * 2 = 584 eggs.\n\nI hope it is correct: 584",
        "ground_truth": "They'll need to make an estimated 0.5 * 53 = <<0.5*53=26.5>>26.5 omelets for small children.\nThey'll need to make an estimated 1 * 35 = <<1*35=35>>35 omelets for older children.\nThey'll need to make an estimated 2 * 75 = <<2*75=150>>150 omelets for the adults.\nAnd they'll need to make an estimated 1.5 * 37 = <<1.5*37=55.5>>55.5 omelets for the seniors.\nAlong with the 25 extra omelets they'll make as a buffer, they will need enough eggs for 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 + 25 = <<26.5+35+150+55.5+25=292>>292 omelets.\nSo they will need 2 * 292 = <<2*292=584>>584 eggs.\n#### 584"
