At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames paves a new parking lot.  It is 400 feet by 500 feet.  Only 80% of that is useable for parking.  It takes 10 square feet to park a car.  How many cars can be parked?",

Calculate the useable area for parking: 200,000 square feet x 0.80 = 160,000 square feet\n3. Divide the useable area by the area required to park a car: 160,000 square feet / 10 square feet per car = 16,000 cars\nI hope it is correct: 16,000",
