At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA fruit and vegetable merchant installed 15 kg of carrots, 13 kg of zucchini and 8 kg of broccoli. He sold only half of them. What mass of vegetables did he sell?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total mass of vegetables: 15 kg + 13 kg + 8 kg = 36 kg.\n2. Calculate the mass of vegetables sold by taking half of the total mass: 36 kg \u00f7 2 = 18 kg.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 18 kg**",
        "ground_truth": "You first need to know the total weight of the vegetables, so you add each quantity: 15 + 13 + 8 = <<15+13+8=36>>36 kg\nThen you have to find half of 36: 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 kg.\nSo, he sold 18 kg of vegetables.\n#### 18"
