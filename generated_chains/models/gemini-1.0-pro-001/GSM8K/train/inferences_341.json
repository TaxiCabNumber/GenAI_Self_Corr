At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSamuel swept the porch and cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from it. As he walked across the porch afterward, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind. How many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept if there were 331 after he walked across it?",
        "inference": "1. Let x be the number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it.\n2. Samuel swept nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch, so after he swept it, there were 0.1x dust particles left.\n3. Samuel's shoes left 223 dust particles behind, so after he walked across the porch, there were 0.1x + 223 dust particles on the porch.\n4. We know that there were 331 dust particles on the porch after Samuel walked across it, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n```\n0.1x + 223 = 331\n```\n\n5. Solving for x, we get:\n\n```\n0.1x = 108\n```\n\n```\nx = 1080\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: 1080",
        "ground_truth": "Before Samuel walked across the porch, there were 331 - 223 = <<331-223=108>>108 dust particles.\nThose 108 were 1/10 of the original amount, so there were 108 * 10 = <<108*10=1080>>1080 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept.\n#### 1080"
