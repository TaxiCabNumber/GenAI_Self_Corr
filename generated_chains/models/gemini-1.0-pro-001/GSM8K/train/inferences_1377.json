At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA teacher asked Adelaide, Ephraim, and Kolton to buy ducks and monitor their growth patterns and features for their science class. Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought, while Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton. If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, what's the average number of ducks the three bought?",
        "inference": "**Adelaide:** 30 ducks\n**Ephraim:** 30 / 2 = 15 ducks\n**Kolton:** 15 + 45 = 60 ducks\n\n**Total Ducks:** 30 + 15 + 60 = 105\n\n**Average Ducks:** 105 / 3 = 35\n\nI hope it is correct: 35",
        "ground_truth": "If Adelaide bought 30 ducks, Ephraim bought 30 ducks / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 ducks.\nSince Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton, Kolton bought 45 ducks + 15 ducks = <<45+15=60>>60 ducks\nThe total number of ducks the three bought is 60 ducks + 15 ducks + 30 ducks = <<60+15+30=105>>105 ducks\nThe average number of ducks each bought is 105 ducks / 3 people = <<105/3=35>>35 ducks/person\n#### 35"
