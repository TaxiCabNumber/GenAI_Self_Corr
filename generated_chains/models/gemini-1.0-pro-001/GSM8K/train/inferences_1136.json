At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nEmily loves to have pets and for that reason, she has 4 dogs in her home. Each one eats 250 grams of food per day. She has to go on vacation for 14 days. How many kilograms of food should she buy for her 4 dogs so they don't starve while she is out?",

Calculate the total amount of food all 4 dogs eat in 14 days: 3500 grams/dog x 4 dogs = 14000 grams\n3. Convert the total amount of food to kilograms: 14000 grams / 1000 grams/kilogram = 14 kilograms\nI hope it is correct: 14",
        "ground_truth": "Each dog would eat 250 grams so 4 will would eat 4 x 250 grams = <<4*250=1000>>1000 grams of food per day.\n1.000 grams is equal a 1 kilogram.\nEmily is going on vacation for 14 days and with the 4 dogs together eating 1 kilogram of food per day, 14 days x 1 kg of food/day = <<14*1=14>>14 kg of food would be enough for two weeks.\n#### 14"
