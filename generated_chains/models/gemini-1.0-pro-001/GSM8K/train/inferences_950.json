At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTheodore can craft 10 stone statues and 20 wooden statues every month. A stone statue costs $20 and a wooden statue costs $5. He also pays 10 percent of his total earnings in taxes. How much is his total earning every month?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate Theodore's earnings from stone statues:\n10 stone statues x $20 per statue = $200\n\n2. Calculate Theodore's earnings from wooden statues:\n20 wooden statues x $5 per statue = $100\n\n3. Calculate Theodore's total earnings:\n$200 + $100 = $300\n\n4. Calculate the amount of taxes Theodore pays:\n10% of $300 = $30\n\n5. Subtract the taxes from Theodore's total earnings to get his net earnings:\n$300 - $30 = $270\nI hope it is correct: $270",
        "ground_truth": "Theodore's total earnings from the stone statues are 10 x $20 = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nHis total earnings from wooden statues are 20 x $5 = $<<20*5=100>>100.\nSo his total earnings from the stone and wooden statue are $200 + $100 = $<<200+100=300>>300.\nThe amount he pays for the tax is $300 x 10/100 = $<<300*10/100=30>>30.\nTherefore his total monthly earnings are $300 - $30 = $<<300-30=270>>270.\n#### 270"
