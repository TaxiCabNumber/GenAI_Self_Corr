Every Monday he delivers 20 yards of fabric, and every Tuesday he delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday. Every Wednesday, he delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday. If each yard of fabric costs $2 and each yard of yarn costs $3, how much does he earn from Monday to Wednesday?",

On Tuesday, Daniel delivers twice the amount of fabric he delivers on Monday, so he delivers 20 x 2 = 40 yards of fabric. He earns 40 x $2 = $80. \n\n\n3. On Wednesday, Daniel delivers 1/4 of the amount of fabric he delivers on Tuesday, so he delivers 40 x 1/4 = 10 yards of fabric. He earns 10 x $2 = $20.\n\n\n4.
