At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn earthquake caused four buildings to collapse. Experts predicted that each following earthquake would have double the number of collapsing buildings as the previous one, since each one would make the foundations less stable. After three more earthquakes, how many buildings had collapsed including those from the first earthquake?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of buildings that collapsed in each subsequent earthquake.\n\n* First earthquake: 4 buildings\n* Second earthquake: 4 x 2 = 8 buildings\n* Third earthquake: 8 x 2 = 16 buildings\n\n**Step 2:** Add the number of collapsed buildings from each earthquake.\n\n4 (first earthquake) + 8 (second earthquake) + 16 (third earthquake) = 28 buildings\n\n**Final Answer:** I hope it is correct: 28 buildings",
        "ground_truth": "The second earthquake caused 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 buildings to collapse.\nThe third earthquake caused 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 buildings to collapse.\nThe fourth earthquake caused 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 buildings to collapse.\nIncluding the first earthquake, the earthquakes caused 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = <<4+8+16+32=60>>60 buildings to collapse.\n#### 60"
