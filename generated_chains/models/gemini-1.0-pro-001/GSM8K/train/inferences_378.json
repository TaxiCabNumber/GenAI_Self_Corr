At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nUki owns a bakery. She sells cupcakes at $1.50 each, cookies at $2 per packet, and biscuits at $1 per packet. In a day, she can bake an average of twenty cupcakes, ten packets of cookies, and twenty packets of biscuits.  How much will be her total earnings for five days?",
