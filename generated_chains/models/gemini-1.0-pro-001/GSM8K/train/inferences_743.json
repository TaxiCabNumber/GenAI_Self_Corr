        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarol is an aviation engineer deciding how much fuel to put in a jet. The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile. Each person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, and each bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile. If there are 30 passengers and 5 flight crew, and each person brought two bags, how many gallons of fuel does the plane need for a 400-mile trip?",
        "inference": "The empty plane needs 20 gallons of fuel per mile.\nEach person on the plane increases this amount by 3 gallons per mile, so 35 people (30 passengers + 5 flight crew) will increase the fuel need by 35 * 3 = 105 gallons per mile.\nEach bag increases it by 2 gallons per mile, so 70 bags (35 people * 2 bags each) will increase the fuel need by 70 * 2 = 140 gallons per mile.\nTherefore, the total fuel needed per mile is 20 + 105 + 140 = 265 gallons per mile.\nFor a 400-mile trip, the plane will need 265 * 400 = 106,000 gallons of fuel.\nI hope it is correct: 106000 $answer$",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = <<30+5=35>>35 people\nThen find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 35 people * 2 bags/person = <<35*2=70>>70 bags\nThen find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 35 people * 3 gallons/mile/person = <<35*3=105>>105 gallons/mile\nThen multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 70 bags * 2 gallons/mile/bag = <<70*2=140>>140 gallons/mile\nNow add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 140 gallons/mile + 105 gallons/mile + 20 gallons/mile = <<140+105+20=265>>265 gallons/mile\nNow multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 265 gallons/mile * 400 miles = <<265*400=106000>>106,000 gallons of fuel\n#### 106000"
