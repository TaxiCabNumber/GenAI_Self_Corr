At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA real estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?",
        "inference": "1. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 newspaper ads. So, the total cost of newspaper ads is 5 x 50 = $250.\n\n2. The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 television ads. So, the total cost of television ads is 75 x 15 = $1125.\n\n3. The total cost of all the ads is the sum of the cost of newspaper ads and the cost of television ads. So, the total cost is 250 + 1125 = $1375.\n\nI hope it is correct: $1375$",
        "ground_truth": "He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.\nHe spent a total of $75 x 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125 for the television ads.\nTherefore, the real estate agent spent $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375 on buying all the ads.\n#### 1375"
