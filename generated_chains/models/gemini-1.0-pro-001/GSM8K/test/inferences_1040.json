At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Monday the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. On Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. How many letters did the post office deliver Monday - Wednesday?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.\nOne-fifth of 425 is 425/5 = 85.\nSo, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.\nTwice as many as 102 is 102 x 2 = 204.\nSo, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.\n\n**Step 3:** Add the number of letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.\n\nI hope it is correct: 736",
