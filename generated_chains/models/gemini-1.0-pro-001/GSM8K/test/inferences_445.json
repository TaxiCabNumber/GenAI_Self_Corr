At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMichael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?",

Determine the number of bails of hay eaten: 16 miles \u00d7 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails of hay\n4. Calculate the total cost of the hay: Total cost = Number of bails \u00d7 Cost per bail = 8 bails \u00d7 $3/bail = $24\n5. Determine the amount of money Michael has: Amount of money = Number of bills \u00d7 Value per bill = 6 bills \u00d7 $5/bill = $30\n6. Calculate the change Michael has: Change = Amount of money - Total cost = $30 - $24 = $6\n7. $6\n\nI hope it is correct: $6",
