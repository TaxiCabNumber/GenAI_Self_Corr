She counts 12 female lions, half as many male lions, and 14 lion cubs. How many lions are in the enclosure?",
        "inference": "1. The zookeeper counts 12 female lions.\n2. She counts half as many male lions as female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.\n3. She also counts 14 lion cubs.\n4. To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, the number of male lions, and the number of lion cubs.\n5. So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.\n\nI hope it is correct: 32",
