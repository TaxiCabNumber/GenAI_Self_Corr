        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing to perform a laboratory experiment.  Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench.  By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.  And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench.  In total, the number of items Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29.  How many beakers did Igor lose?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nDr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered 16/2 = 8 test tubes.\nIgor gathered 14 Petri dishes, and 2 more than that is 14 + 2 = 16.\nTherefore, Igor gathered a total of 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items.\nHowever, Igor only had 29 items on the lab bench, which means he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 2 beakers",
        "ground_truth": "On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.\nOn the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.\nSince the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.\nThus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.\n#### 2"
