At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?",
        "inference": "First, let's find the total number of skeins needed for one grandchild.\n\n2 skeins for a hat\n4 skeins for a scarf\n12 skeins for a sweater\n1 skein for a pair of mittens\n2 skeins for a pair of socks\nTotal: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins\n\nNow, let's multiply this number by the number of grandchildren (3):\n\n21 skeins x 3 grandchildren = 63 skeins\n\nI hope it is correct: 63 $skeins$",
        "ground_truth": "A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.\n#### 63"
