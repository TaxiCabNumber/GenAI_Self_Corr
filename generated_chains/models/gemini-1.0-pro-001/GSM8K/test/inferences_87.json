At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company pays each of its employees $600 in a month. The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years of service?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate Sylvie's salary for the first five years:\n$600 x 12 months x 5 years = $36,000\n2. Calculate the 10% increase for the first year after the five years:\n$36,000 x 0.10 = $3,600\n3. Add the increase to the salary for the first year after the five years:\n$36,000 + $3,600 = $39,600\n4. Calculate the 10% increase for the second year after the five years:\n$39,600 x 0.10 = $3,960\n5. Add the increase to the salary for the second year after the five years:\n$39,600 + $3,960 = $43,560\n6. Calculate the 10% increase for the third year after the five years:\n$43,560 x 0.10 = $4,356\n7. Add the increase to the salary for the third year after the five years:\n$43,560 + $4,356 = $47,916\nI hope it is correct: $47,916",
        "ground_truth": "In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.\nSylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.\nIn three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160\nAfter three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360\n#### 9360"
