At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA singer has 50 microphones that he wants to arrange in pairs on a stage. While making the arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs:\n20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones\n\n2. Determine the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs:\n50 - 10 = 40 microphones\n\n3. Divide the number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2 to find the number of pairs:\n40 / 2 = 20 pairs\n\nI hope it is correct: 20 pairs",
        "ground_truth": "The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10\nThis means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.\nSince a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.\n#### 20"
