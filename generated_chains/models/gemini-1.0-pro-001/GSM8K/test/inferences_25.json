At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?",
