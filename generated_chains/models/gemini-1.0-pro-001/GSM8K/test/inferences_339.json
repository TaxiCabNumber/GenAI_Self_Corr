He has twice as many chickens as cows. How many legs do the animals have, all together?",

The total number of animals is x + 2x = 3x, which is given as 60.\n\n4. So, x = 60 / 3 = 20.\n\n5. The number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is 2 * 20 = 40.\n\n6. A cow has 4 legs, and a chicken has 2 legs.\n\n7. So, the total number of legs is (20 * 4) + (40 * 2) = 80 + 80 = 160.\n\nI hope it is correct: 160",
