At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day how many grams of protein does he get per week?",
        "inference": "Each 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein.\nSince John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 2 times 3 grams of protein, which is 6 grams of protein per day.\nIn a week, there are 7 days, so John gets 6 * 7 grams of protein per week.\nTherefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.\nI hope it is correct: 42",
        "ground_truth": "He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day\nSo that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day\nSo he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week\n#### 42"
