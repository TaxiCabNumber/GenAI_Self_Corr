At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBritany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok. How much time does Britany spend on TikTok in a month with four weeks?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the time spent on TikTok videos to hours: 18 videos x 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week = 1.2 hours/week\n2. Convert the time spent on writing songs to hours: 2 hours/week\n3. Convert the time spent on makeup to hours: 15 minutes/day x 6 days/week = 1.5 hours/week\n4. Add up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and makeup: 1.2 hours/week + 2 hours/week + 1.5 hours/week = 4.7 hours/week\n5. Multiply the time spent on TikTok per week by the number of weeks in a month: 4.7 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 18.8 hours/month\n\nI hope it is correct: 18.8 hours/month",
