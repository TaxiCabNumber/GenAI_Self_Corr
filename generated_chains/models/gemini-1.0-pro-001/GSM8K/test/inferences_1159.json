At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarla just gave birth to identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. If all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows, what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?",

        "ground_truth": "First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies\nThen multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies\nThen subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies\nNow divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%\n#### 50"
