At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- Clara paid $20 per pomegranate. She bought 20 pomegranates, so she paid $20 \\times 20 = $400$.\n- She used a $2 voucher, which lowered the price by $2. So, she paid $400 - $2 = $398$.\n- Sheila paid $30 per pomegranate. She bought 20 pomegranates, so she paid $30 \\times 20 = $600$.\n- The discount was 10%, so she paid $600 \\times 0.10 = $60$ less.\n- She paid $600 - $60 = $540$.\n- The difference between the prices paid is $540 - $398 = $142$.\n**I hope it is correct: $142$**",
        "ground_truth": "On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400\nUsing the voucher, she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398\nOn Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.\nShe then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60\nSheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540\nThe difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142\n#### 142"
