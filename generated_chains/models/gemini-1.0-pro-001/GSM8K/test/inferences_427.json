He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?",

(2/3) * x = 2x/3\n\nKenny sold each card for $1.5, so the total amount he made from selling cards is (2x/3) * $1.5 = $x.\n\nHe used $50 of that money to buy spending cash, so he has $100 - $50 = $50 left to buy the ticket.\n\nTherefore, $x = $50.\n\nI hope it is correct: 100 $cards$",
