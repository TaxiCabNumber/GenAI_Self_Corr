At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?",

Mathematically, we can write this as:\n\n32 - 4 = 2(x + x)\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n28 = 4x\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.\n\nI hope it is correct: 7",
