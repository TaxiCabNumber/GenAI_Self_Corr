At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the small pool currently has \"x\" gallons of water.\n\nFour minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so the big pool had 2x gallons of water.\n\nNow, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the big pool has 4x gallons of water.\n\nTherefore, the big pool gained 2x gallons of water in the last four minutes.\n\nSince both pools are leaking at the same rate of 4 gallons/minute, the big pool gained 4 gallons of water in four minutes from the small pool leaking.\n\nSo, the small pool lost 4 gallons in four minutes.\n\nHence, the small pool currently has x - 4 gallons of water.\n\nI hope it is correct: $x - 4$",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons\nLet b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32\nSubtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16\nDividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8"
