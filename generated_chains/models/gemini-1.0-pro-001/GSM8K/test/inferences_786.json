At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRicardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes while each plant of eggplant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?",
        "inference": "1. Multiply the number of tomato plants by the number of tomatoes each plant yields: 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes\n2. Multiply the number of eggplant plants by the number of eggplants each plant yields: 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants\n3. Add the number of tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142\nI hope it is correct: 142",
        "ground_truth": "Ricardo can get 22 x 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 tomatoes.\nHe can get 4 x 8 = <<4*8=32>>32 eggplants.\nTherefore, Ricardo can get a total of 110 +32 = <<110+32=142>>142 fruits from his plants.\n#### 142"
