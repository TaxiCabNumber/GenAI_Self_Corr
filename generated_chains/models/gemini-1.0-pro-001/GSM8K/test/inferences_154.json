On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?",
        "inference": "- **Step 1**: First, calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He has three 1-hour classes each day, three times per week, for a total of 9 hours per week.\n- **Step 2**: Next, calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He has two 2-hour classes each day, two times per week, for a total of 8 hours per week.\n- **Step 3**: Add the number of hours Kimo spends in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to the number of hours he spends in class on Tuesdays and Thursdays: 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week.\n- **Step 4**: Multiply the number of hours Kimo spends in class per week by the number of weeks in a semester: 17 hours per week * 16 weeks = 272 hours per semester.\nI hope it is correct: 272",
