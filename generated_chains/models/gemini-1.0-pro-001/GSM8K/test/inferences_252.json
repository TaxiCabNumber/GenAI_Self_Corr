At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast night Rick killed ten wolves and 15 cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?",
        "inference": "1. Last night Rick killed ten wolves and 15 cougars while hunting. So, the total number of animals he killed last night is 10 + 15 = 25.\n2. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. So, if he killed x cougars today, he killed 3x wolves.\n3. Today Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, if he killed x cougars today, he killed x + 3 cougars last night.\n4. We know that the total number of cougars Rick killed is the sum of the number he killed last night and today. So, the total number of cougars he killed is x + (x + 3) = 2x + 3.\n5. We also know that the total number of animals Rick killed is 25. So, we can write an equation to solve for x:\n25 = 10 + 15 + 3x + 2x + 3\n25 = 25 + 5x\n0 = 5x\nx = 0\n6. This means that Rick killed 0 cougars today.\n7. Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, he killed 3 * 0 = 0 wolves today.\n8. Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed today is 0 + 0 = 0.\n9. Adding the number of animals Rick killed last night and today, we get 25 + 0 = 25.\n\nI hope it is correct: 25",
