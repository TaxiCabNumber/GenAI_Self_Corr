At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDenise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday, while Daniel was not able to read any pages today. How many more pages did Denise read more than Daniel?",
        "inference": "Denise read 10 pages yesterday. Today, she read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday, which was 13. So, today she read 13 + 5 = 18 pages. Therefore, in total, Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages.\n\nDaniel read 13 pages yesterday. Today, he didn't read any pages. So, in total, Daniel read 13 + 0 = 13 pages.\n\nTherefore, Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.\n\nI hope it is correct: 15",
