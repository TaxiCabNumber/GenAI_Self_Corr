At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLiam and Mitchell own competing lemonade stands across the street from one another. When Liam bragged that he had made $63 one weekend, Mitchell laughed and told Liam he had sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece the same weekend. How many more dollars did Mitchell make selling lemonade that weekend than Liam?",
