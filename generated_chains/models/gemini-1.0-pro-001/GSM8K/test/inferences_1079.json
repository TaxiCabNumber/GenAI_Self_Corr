At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?",
        "inference": "Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so he paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it, so his friend paid 1.2 * $1500 = $1800. Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is (2000 - 1800) / 2000 * 100 = 10%.\nI hope it is correct: 10 %",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10"
