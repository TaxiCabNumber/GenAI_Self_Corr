On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.",

Add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance.\n- Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance\n- Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles\n- Total distance = 110 miles\n\nI hope it is correct: 110 miles",
