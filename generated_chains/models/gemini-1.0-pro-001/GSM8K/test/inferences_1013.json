At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJanet gets a job as a waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  She wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work to save the down payment?",

Calculate the amount of the down payment: $10000 x 20% = $2000\n4. Divide the amount of the down payment by the amount Janet will save in one week: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks\nI hope it is correct: 2 weeks",
        "ground_truth": "She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working\nThat means each week she makes 25*40=$<<25*40=1000>>1000\nShe wants to make 10000*.2=$<<10000*.2=2000>>2000\nSo she needs to work 2000/1000=<<2000/1000=2>>2 weeks\n#### 2"
