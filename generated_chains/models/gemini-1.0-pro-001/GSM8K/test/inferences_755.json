At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJoey plays football every week. Last week he played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. How many matches did Joey play in one week?",
        "inference": "Joey played 2 matches on Monday. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, so he played 2 * 2 = 4 matches on Saturday. He also played 1 match on Friday. Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 2 + 4 + 1 = 7. I hope it is correct: 7",
