At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTwo cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?",
