At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGarrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**\n\nFind the number of kernels that popped in each time interval:\n* First 30 seconds: 20 kernels\n* Second 30 seconds: 3 * 20 = 60 kernels\n* Third 30 seconds: 4 * 20 = 80 kernels\n* Final 30 seconds: 80 / 2 = 40 kernels\n* Residual heat: 40 / 4 = 10 kernels\n\n**Step 2**\n\nSum the number of kernels that popped in each time interval:\n* Total kernels popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels\n\n**Step 3**\n\nSince Garrett popped the popcorn for a snack, assume he will eat all of it:\n* Number of pieces of popcorn to eat: 210\n\nI hope it is correct: 210",
        "ground_truth": "In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.\nIn the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.\nThus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 210"
