At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn visits his parents twice a month.  It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph.  Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\n* First, we need to calculate the distance John drives one way to visit his parents.\n\n```\nDistance = Speed * Time\n= 70 mph * 2 hours\n= 140 miles\n```\n\n* Next, we need to calculate the total distance John drives in one month, considering the round trip.\n\n```\nTotal Distance = Distance One Way * Number of Visits per Month\n= 140 miles * 2 visits per month\n= 280 miles\n```\n\n**I hope it is correct: 280 miles**",
        "ground_truth": "His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away\nSo he drives 140*2=<<140*2=280>>280 miles a round trip\n280*2 = <<280*2=560>>560 miles a month\n#### 560"
