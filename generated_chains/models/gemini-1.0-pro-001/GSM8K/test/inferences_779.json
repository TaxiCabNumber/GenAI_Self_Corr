At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?",
        "inference": "1. The Llesis family drove 50mph and hiked 5mph less than half that speed, which is 25-5=20mph.\n2. Since they spent 1.5 hours hiking we multiply the speed by time to get the distance covered hiking. 20mph * 1.5h = 30 miles\n3. Since the total time was 6 hours, we subtract the time spent hiking (1.5 hours) from the total time to get the time spent driving 6h - 1.5h = 4.5h\n4. We multiply the driving speed by the time spent driving to get the distance covered driving, 50mph * 4.5h = 225 miles\n5. We then add the distances covered driving and hiking to get the total distance to their vacation spot, 30 miles + 225 miles = 255 miles \nI hope it is correct: 255",
        "ground_truth": "Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.\nSo, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.\nIt took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.\nSo, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.\nTherefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.\n#### 255"
