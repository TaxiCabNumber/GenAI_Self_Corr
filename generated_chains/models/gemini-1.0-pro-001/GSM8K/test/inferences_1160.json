At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast week the IRS received 5168 tax reports. On Monday and Tuesday they received a total of 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday they received a total of 2136 reports. How many reports did they receive on Wednesday?",

We also know that they received a total of 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday, and a total of 2136 reports on Thursday and Friday.\n3. To find the number of reports they received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports they received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports they received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports they received last week.\n4. So, the number of reports they received on Wednesday is 5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125.\nI hope it is correct: $1125$",
