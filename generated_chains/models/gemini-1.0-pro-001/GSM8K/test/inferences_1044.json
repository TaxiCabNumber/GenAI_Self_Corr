At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height now?",
        "inference": "1. Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches: 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches\n\n\n2. Add the growth to both Cole's and Xavier's height:\n- Cole's new height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches\n- Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches\n\n\n3. Find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's new heights:\n- Difference = Cole's new height - Xavier's new height\n= 52 inches - 51 inches\n= 1 inch\n\nI hope it is correct: 1 $inch$",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let\u2019s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height is now 52 \u2013 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1"
