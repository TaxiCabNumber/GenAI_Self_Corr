        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden. The wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long. How many pieces did she obtain?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 4 feet to inches: 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches\n2. Divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces\nI hope it is correct: 8",
        "ground_truth": "If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.\nSince the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces\n#### 8"
