At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch them all, Pokemon that is.  Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. How many Pokemon has Stan caught?",

Together, they have caught x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339 Pokemon.\n\n9x - 21 = 339\n9x = 360\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = **147** Pokemon.\n\nI hope it is correct: 147",
