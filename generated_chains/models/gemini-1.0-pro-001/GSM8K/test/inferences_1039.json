At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?",
        "inference": "1. **Figure out how big the pieces of fabric need to be.**\nThe bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The pieces of fabric need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they need to be 8 feet long by 10 feet wide.\n\n2. **Calculate the area of each piece of fabric.**\nThe area of a rectangle is length times width. The area of each piece of fabric is 8 feet x 10 feet = 80 square feet.\n\n3. **Add the areas of the two pieces of fabric to find the total area of fabric Jim needs to buy.**\nJim needs to buy 80 square feet + 80 square feet = 160 square feet of fabric.\n\nI hope it is correct: 160 square feet",
        "ground_truth": "First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet\nThen find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet\nThen find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet\nThen double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet\n#### 160"
