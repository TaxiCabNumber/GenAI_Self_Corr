At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMartha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people and 3 families with 4 people. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?",
        "inference": "- First, I will calculate the total number of people invited. 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12 people. 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12 people. So, 12 + 12 = 24 people were invited.\n- Next, I will subtract the number of people who couldn't come due to illness. 8 people couldn't come, so 24 - 8 = 16 people were able to come.\n- Finally, I will subtract the number of people who had previous commitments. 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2, so 16 - 2 = 14 people showed up for Martha's party.\n\nI hope it is correct: 14",
