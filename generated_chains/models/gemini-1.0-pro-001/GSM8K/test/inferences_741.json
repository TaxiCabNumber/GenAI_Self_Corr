At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard and threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. How many birds are now in the backyard?",
