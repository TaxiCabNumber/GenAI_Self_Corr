She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. If Melissa is paid $15 per day but also has to pay $3 for parking each day, how much jury pay does she make per hour after expenses?",

Calculate the total amount Melissa earns for jury duty: $15/day x 3 days = $45\n3. Calculate the total amount Melissa spends on parking: $3/day x 3 days = $9\n4. Subtract the total amount Melissa spends on parking from the total amount she earns for jury duty: $45 - $9 = $36\n5.
