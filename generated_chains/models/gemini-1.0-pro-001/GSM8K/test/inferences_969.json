At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?",

Calculate the cost of the third phone, which is half price: $600 / 2 = $300.\n\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the fourth phone, which is half price: $600 / 2 = $300.\n\n\n4. Add the cost of all the phones: $1200 + $300 + $300 = $1800.\n\n\n5. Conclusion: John paid $1800 for all 4 phones.\n\nI hope it is correct: $1800$",
        "ground_truth": "He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones\n2 of the phones cost 600 so their cost is 2*600=$<<2*600=1200>>1200\nThe other two phones cost 600/2=$<<600/2=300>>300\nSo they cost 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600\nSo the total cost is 1200+600=$<<1200+600=1800>>1800\n#### 1800"
