They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?",

It takes them $15$ minutes per classroom, which is $\\frac{15}{60} = 0.25$ hours per classroom. Therefore, the custodian will spend $80\\cdot 0.25 = 20$ hours cleaning classrooms.
