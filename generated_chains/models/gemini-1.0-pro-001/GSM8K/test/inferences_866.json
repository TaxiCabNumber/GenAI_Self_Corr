At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTogether, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?",
        "inference": "1. Let's represent Anne's number of books as \"x\".\n2. According to the given information, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne. Therefore, Sofie's number of books is \"x + 25\".\n3. Also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. So, Fawn's number of books is \"x + 12\".\n4. Now we know that the total number of books is 85. So, we can write the equation as:\nx + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85\n5. Combining like terms:\nx + x + x + 25 + 12 = 85\n3x + 37 = 85\n6. Subtracting 37 from both sides:\n3x = 85 - 37\n3x = 48\n7. Dividing both sides by 3:\nx = 16\n8. Fawn has 12 books more than Anne. So, Fawn's number of books is:\nx + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28\n\nI hope it is correct: 28",
