At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn the first half of a soccer match, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.
