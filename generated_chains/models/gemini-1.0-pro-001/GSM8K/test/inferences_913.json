At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBenny threw bologna at his balloons.  He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the number of yellow balloons is y. Then, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons is 3y. Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2(20) = 40. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is the sum of the pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow and red balloons, which is 3y + 40. Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total. Therefore, 3y + 40 = 58. Solving for y, we get 3y = 18. Dividing both sides by 3, we get y = 6.\n\nI hope it is correct: y = 6",
        "ground_truth": "If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.\nIf he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at balloons in the bundle, then he threw 58-40=<<58-40=18>>18 pieces of bologna at yellow balloons.\nIf he threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, then he had 18/3=<<18/3=6>>6 yellow balloons.\n#### 6"
