At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFarmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?",
        "inference": "Let's define the number of chickens as \"c\" and the number of cows as \"n\".\n\nWe know that c + n = 20 (Total number of animals)\n\nWe also know that 2c + 4n = 70 (Total number of legs)\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for c:\n\nc = 20 - n\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n2(20 - n) + 4n = 70\n\n40 - 2n + 4n = 70\n\n2n = 30\n\nn = 15\n\nTherefore, the number of cows is 15. Substituting this back into c + n = 20, we get:\n\nc = 20 - 15\n\nc = 5\n\nTherefore, the number of chickens is 5.\n\nI hope it is correct: 5",
