Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours. If he was driving at an average speed of 18mph for both parts of the journey, how far is he from his house now?",

Calculate the distance traveled east:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 18 mph \u00d7 8 hours\n   Distance = 144 miles\n3. Subtract the distance traveled east from the distance traveled west to find the net distance from his house:\n   Net distance = Distance traveled west - Distance traveled east\n   Net distance = 90 miles - 144 miles\n   Net distance = -54 miles\nI hope it is correct: -54 miles",
