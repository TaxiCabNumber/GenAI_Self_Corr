He gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times and an 8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of Wall Street Journal if each costs $5 and $15 respectively?",

Calculate the commission on the Wall Street Journal sales: 8% of 10 copies x $15 = $0.12 per copy x 10 copies = $1.20\n3.
