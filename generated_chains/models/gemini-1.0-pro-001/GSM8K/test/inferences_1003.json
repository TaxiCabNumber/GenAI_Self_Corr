It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of renting the studio for a month: $25 x 3 days/week x 4 weeks/month = $300\n2. Calculate the total cost per student per month: $1.50 x 10 students x 3 days/week x 4 weeks/month = $180\n3. Add the cost of renting the studio and the cost per student: $300 + $180 = $480\nI hope it is correct: $480$",
        "ground_truth": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480"
