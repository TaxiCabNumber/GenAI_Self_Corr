Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.  How many barrels of wine does her farm produce per year?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the total number of tons of grapes produced per year. To do this, multiply the number of acres by the number of tons of grapes produced per acre: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes\n2. Determine the number of barrels of wine produced per year. To do this, multiply the number of tons of grapes by the number of barrels produced per ton: 50 tons of grapes * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine\nI hope it is correct: 100",
