She already finished writing 1/3 of the paper. How many pages does she have left to write?",
        "inference": "1. We need to find out how many pages Shiela has already written.\n2. We know that she has finished writing 1/3 of the paper, so we can multiply the total number of pages (15) by 1/3 to find out how many pages she has written.\n3. 15 x 1/3 = 5\n4. So, Shiela has written 5 pages.\n5. We need to find out how many pages she has left to write.\n6. We can subtract the number of pages she has written (5) from the total number of pages (15) to find out how many pages she has left to write.\n7. 15 - 5 = 10\n8.
