At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOctavia wants to make a quilt for her sister. She is going to build it from small, medium, and large t-shirts that her family is done with. A small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric. A medium one is 4 square feet. A large one is 6 square feet. If she uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium, and 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?",
        "inference": "11 small shirts = 11 x 3 square feet = 33 square feet\n8 medium shirts = 8 x 4 square feet = 32 square feet\n6 large shirts = 6 x 6 square feet = 36 square feet \nTotal square feet = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet\nI hope it is correct: 101",
