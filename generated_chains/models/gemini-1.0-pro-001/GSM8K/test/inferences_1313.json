At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1) Find the total amount of profit made: Profit = 25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20\n\n2) Find the total selling price:  Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = $80 + $20 = $100\n\n3) Find the selling price of each watermelon: Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons = $100 / 50 = $2\n\nI hope it is correct: $2$",
        "ground_truth": "The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.\nSo, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.\nThus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.\n#### 2"
