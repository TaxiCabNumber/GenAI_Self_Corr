At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMiguel uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. If there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper, how many sheets of paper does he use every month?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Convert 1 week to days: 1 week = 7 days\n2. Determine the number of sheets Miguel uses in 1 day: 30 sheets / 7 days = 4.29 sheets/day\n3. Convert 1 month to days: 1 month = 30 days\n4. Calculate the number of sheets Miguel uses in 1 month: 4.29 sheets/day * 30 days = 128.7 sheets\n\nI hope it is correct: 128.7",
