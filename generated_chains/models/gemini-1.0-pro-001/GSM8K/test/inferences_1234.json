At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRegina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of novels she has written this year. \n    - We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. \n    - So, 9 / 3 = x / 4 and Cross-multiplying, we get 9 * 4 = 3 * x or 36 = 3 * x. \n    - Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 12. \nI hope it is correct: 12",
        "ground_truth": "Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\n9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels\n#### 12"
