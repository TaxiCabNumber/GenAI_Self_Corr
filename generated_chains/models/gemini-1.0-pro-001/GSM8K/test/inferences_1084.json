At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIf Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left over for Sam?",
        "inference": "Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so if Sam gets x, Harry gets x + 60.\n\nTogether, they have 100 feet, so:\nx + (x + 60) = 100\n\nCombining like terms:\n2x + 60 = 100\n\nSubtracting 60 from both sides:\n2x = 40\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\nx = 20\n\nSo Sam gets 20 feet of fence.\nI hope it is correct: 20",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100\nSubtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.\n#### 20"
