At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA bird decides to leave her summer home in the north and travel to her winter home in the south.  To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?",
        "inference": "1. Flight Distance Southward = 10 * 30 = 300  Miles\n2. Flight Distance Northward = 2 * 18 = 36 Miles\n3. Flight Distance Southward = 5 * 22 = 110 Miles\n4. Distance between homes = 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 Miles.\n\nI hope it is correct: $374$",
        "ground_truth": "Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.\nFlying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.\nAnd flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.\nAltogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles\n#### 374"
