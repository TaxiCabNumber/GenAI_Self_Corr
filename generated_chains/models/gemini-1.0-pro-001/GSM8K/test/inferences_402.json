The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?",
        "inference": "- One quadruple batch of brownies requires 12 cups of flour (3 x 4 = 12) and 4 cups of milk (1 x 4 = 4).\n- Mark can buy 6 bags of flour (12 cups \u00f7 2 cups/bag = 6 bags) and 2 bottles of milk (4 cups \u00f7 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles).\n- Therefore, Mark has to buy 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. I hope it is correct: 4",
