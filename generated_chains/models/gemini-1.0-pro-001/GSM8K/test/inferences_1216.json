At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA bus has a capacity of 200 people. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.",
        "inference": "1. At the first station, 40 people entered the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.\n2. At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered the bus, which is 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.\n3. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, so the total number of people on the bus became 90 * 2 = 180.\n4. To fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need 200 - 180 = 20 people.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
        "ground_truth": "If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.\nAfter the second station, the number of people on the bus was 20 people initially on the bus + 40 who entered at the first station + 30 who entered at the second station= <<20+40+30=90>>90 people.\nThe number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.\nIf the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people\n#### 20"
