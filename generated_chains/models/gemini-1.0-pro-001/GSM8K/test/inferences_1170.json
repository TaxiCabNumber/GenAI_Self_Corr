At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA wall mural has four different colors of paint in it: red, white, purple, and yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints of red paint was used?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nLet's assume x is the amount of red, white, and purple paint used. Then, the amount of yellow paint used is 2x. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we have: x + x + x + 2x = 12. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 12. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 2.4. Therefore, the amount of red paint used is x = 2.4 pints.\nI hope it is correct: 2.4",
        "ground_truth": "Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.\nThe mural has equal amounts of the other three colors, so it used 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 pints of red paint.\n#### 2"
