At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRyan\u2019s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the allowance he made from doing his chores: \nAllowance = number of weeks * allowance per week\nAllowance = 3 * $6 = $18\n\n2. Then calculate how many ice cream cones he could buy:\nNumber of cones = Allowance / cost per cone\nNumber of cones = $18 / $1.25 = 14.4\n\n3. The number of cones is not a whole number, so take the floor of the value and multiply it by the cost of the cone:\nNumber of cones = 14 * $1.25 = $17.50\n\n4. Subtract the cost of the cones from his allowance:\nRemaining balance = Allowance - cost of cones\nRemaining balance = $18 - $17.50 = $0.50\n\n5. Finally, calculate how many movie tickets he can buy:\nNumber of tickets = Remaining balance / cost per ticket\nNumber of tickets = $0.50 / $6.50 = 0.0769\n\n6. Round the answer down to the nearest whole number to arrive at the number of tickets he can buy:\nNumber of tickets = 0\n\nI hope it is correct: 0",
        "ground_truth": "Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.\nHe bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.\nThe ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.\nRyan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.\nWith the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.\n#### 2"
