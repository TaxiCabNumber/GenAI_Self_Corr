Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. On the second street, each child is joined by another child and on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children. The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?",

Each of the 5 children from the first street is joined by another child, so there are 5 x 2 = 10 children on the second street.\n\nNext, let's consider the number of children on the third street. Each of the 10 children from the second street is joined by another 2 children, so there are 10 x 3 = 30 children on the third street.\n\nFinally, the original 5 children from the first street leave the group, so there are 30 - 5 = 25 children now following the truck.\n\nI hope it is correct: 25",
