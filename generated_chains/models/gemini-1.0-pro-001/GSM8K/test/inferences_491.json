At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJaime places eggs on the tray. Each tray can hold 24 eggs. If he has 64 eggs and 2 trays, how many eggs won't he be able to place on the tray?",

Subtract the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs: 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs\n3. Therefore, 16 eggs will not be able to be placed on the tray.\nI hope it is correct: 16 eggs",
        "ground_truth": "Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.\nTherefore, there are 64 - 48 = <<64-48=16>>16 eggs that he won't be able to place on the tray.\n#### 16"
