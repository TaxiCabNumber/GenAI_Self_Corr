At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn packs M&M in small bags to eat.  He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each.  If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 in each small bag?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the weight of the large bags to ounces: 3 * 10 ounces = 30 ounces.\n2. Calculate the total number of M&M: 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.\n3. Divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M in each small bag: 900 M&M / 10 M&M/bag = 90 bags.\nI hope it is correct: 90",
        "ground_truth": "He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 ounces of M&M\nThat means he got 30*30=<<30*30=900>>900 M&Ms\nSo he can make 900/10=<<900/10=90>>90 bags\n#### 90"
