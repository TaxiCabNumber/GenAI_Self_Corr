At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?",
