Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.**\n\nThere are 31 days in January, 28 days in February, 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 days in June, and 19 days in July (up to the 19th).\n\nSo, the total number of days is 365 - 365 - 31 - 28 - 31 - 30 - 31 - 30 + 19 = 199 days.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn.**\n\nAndy wants to lose 30 lbs. and each pound requires 3500 calories to burn.\n\nSo, the total number of calories Andy needs to burn is 30 * 3500 = 105000 calories.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit.**\n\nTo lose 30 lbs. by July 19th, Andy needs to burn 105000 calories over 199 days.\n\nSo, the daily calorie deficit is 105000 / 199 = 527 calories.\n\nI hope it is correct: 527",
        "ground_truth": "January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.\nHe wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,\nTo reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.\n#### 525"
