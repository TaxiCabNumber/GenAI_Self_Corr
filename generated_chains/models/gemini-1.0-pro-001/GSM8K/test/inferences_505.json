At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the cost per stick for each size of wood.\n- 2 x 4: $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick\n- 2 x 8: $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick\n\n2. Determine how many sticks Frederick can buy for $24 with each size of wood.\n- 2 x 4: $24 / $0.02 per stick = 1,200 sticks\n- 2 x 8: $24 / $0.015 per stick = 1,600 sticks\n\n3. Choose the size of wood that gives Frederick the most sticks for his money.\n- 2 x 8 gives Frederick 1,600 sticks, which is more than the 1,200 sticks he would get from 2 x 4s.\n\n4. Determine the total number of sticks Frederick can make with the 2 x 8s.\n- Frederick can buy 1,600 sticks with $24.\n- Since each 2 x 8 gives him 400 sticks, he can make a total of 1,600 / 400 = 4 popsicles.\n\nI hope it is correct: 4",
