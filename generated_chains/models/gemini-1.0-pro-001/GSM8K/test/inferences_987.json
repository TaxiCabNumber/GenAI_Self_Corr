At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nArtemis is potting flowers with her father. They buy a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds. Each Sunflower needs 3 pounds. If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations:\n4 sunflowers x 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds\n10 carnations x 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds\nTotal soil needed for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds\n\n2. Subtract the soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil:\n30 pounds (total soil) - 27 pounds (soil needed for sunflowers and carnations) = 3 pounds\n\n3. Divide the remaining soil by the amount needed for each rose to find the number of roses that can be planted:\n3 pounds (remaining soil) / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses\n\nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12\nThey used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15\nThey have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27\nThey have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3\nThe can plant three roses because 3 / 1 = <<3/1=3>>3\n#### 3"
