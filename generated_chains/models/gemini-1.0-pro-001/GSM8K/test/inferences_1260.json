At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJade bought a new cell phone with an incredible camera, so she spent all week taking pictures of her daily life. At the end of the week, she had taken 210 photos. She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?",
