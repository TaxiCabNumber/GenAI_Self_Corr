At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?",
