        "inference": "**Problem:**\nMark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, what was his initial weight?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the total weight lost: 10 pounds/month x 3 months = 30 pounds lost.\n2. Subtract the weight lost from the final weight: 70 pounds (final weight) - 30 pounds (weight lost) = 40 pounds.\n3.
