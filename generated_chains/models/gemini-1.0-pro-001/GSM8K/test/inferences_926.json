At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nColby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?",
