        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**  \n- There are 300 rolls, each 4 inches long. So the total length of the rolls is 300 x 4 = 1200 inches or 1200 / 12 = 100 feet.  \n- There are 120 croissants, each 6 inches long. So the total length of the croissants is 120 x 6 = 720 inches or 720 / 12 = 60 feet.  \n- There are 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long. So the total length of the baguettes is 60 x 2 = 120 feet.  \n- The total length of all the baked goods is 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet.  \nI hope it is correct: 280 feet",
