At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\n1. Calculate Jen's earnings for one week:\n\n```\n7.5 hours/day x 6 days/week x $1.5/hour = $67.50\n```\n\n2. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance:\n\n```\n$67.50 + $10 = $77.50\n```\n\n3. Multiply by the number of weeks in April:\n\n```\n$77.50 x 4 weeks = $310\n```\n\n**Final Answer:** I hope it is correct: $310",
        "ground_truth": "In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week\nSo in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.\n180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.\nSince she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.\n#### 280"
