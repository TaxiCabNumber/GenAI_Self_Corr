A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?",

Let x be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.\n4. The number of large jellyfish that change color is 6.\n5. So, 1/3 * (1/5 * x) = 6\n6. Solve for x.\nI hope it is correct: 150 $jellyfish$",
