At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTerri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?",
        "inference": "Body of the sweater: 900 stitches.\nCollar: 1/10 of 900 = 90 stitches.\nRosette: 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.\nTotal: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.\nEach sleeve: (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.\nI hope it is correct: 315",
        "ground_truth": "The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.\nThe rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.\nThe body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.\nThus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.\nThus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.\n#### 315"
