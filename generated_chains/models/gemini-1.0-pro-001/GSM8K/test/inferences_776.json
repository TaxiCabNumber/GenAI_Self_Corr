At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe price of a laptop is $1000. If you get a 20% discount, how much do you have to pay?",

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price: 1000 - 200 = 800.\n4.  Therefore, you have to pay $800.\nI hope it is correct: 800",
