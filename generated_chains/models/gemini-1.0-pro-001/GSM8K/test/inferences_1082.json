At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames decided to walk to the store.  When he got halfway there he realized he forgot something at home and had to walk back.  If his home is 4 miles from the store and he walks 4 miles per hour how long did it take him to reach the store?",
        "inference": "1. He walked halfway to the store, which is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.\n2. He walked back home, which is another 2 miles.\n3. Then he walked to the store again, which is another 2 miles.\n4. So, he walked a total of 2 miles + 2 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.\n5. He walked 4 miles per hour, so it took him 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\nI hope it is correct: 1.5 hours",
        "ground_truth": "He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around\nSo in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.\nThat means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours\n#### 2"
