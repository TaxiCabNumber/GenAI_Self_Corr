At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarilyn wants to buy a pair of boots online. On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4. On eBay, those same pair of shoes are only $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon. How much more expensive do the boots work out to be on eBay?",

To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we add the price of the boots to twice the shipping cost on Amazon: $13 + 2 x $4 = $21.\n3. To find how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.\n\nI hope it is correct: $1$",
