She wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days by storing them in the freezer. Her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies.  How many dozens of cookies will she need to make so she has enough for 30 days?",

One dozen is equal to 12 cookies.\n4. Shannon eats 2 cookies a night.\n5. Therefore, she will need 2 cookies * 30 days = 60 cookies in total.\n6.
