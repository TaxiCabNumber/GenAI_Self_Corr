At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCrista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?",

Find the total number of cups of water needed for the plants that need 1 cup of water: 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups of water.\n3. Find the total number of cups of water needed for the plants that need a quarter of a cup of water: 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.\n4. Add the total number of cups of water needed for each group of plants: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water.\nI hope it is correct: 12 $",
        "ground_truth": "She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups\nShe will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.\nSince she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.\nSince 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.\nIn total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.\n#### 12"
