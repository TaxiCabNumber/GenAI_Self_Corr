He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?",

Calculate the total volume of potting soil needed for all 10 raised beds:\n\nTotal volume = number of beds x volume of each bed\nTotal volume = 10 beds x 32 cubic feet\nTotal volume = 320 cubic feet\n\n3. Calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed:\n\nNumber of bags = total volume / volume per bag\nNumber of bags = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag\nNumber of bags = 160 bags\n\n4.
