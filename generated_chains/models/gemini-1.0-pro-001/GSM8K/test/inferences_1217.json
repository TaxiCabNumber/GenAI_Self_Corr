At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?",
