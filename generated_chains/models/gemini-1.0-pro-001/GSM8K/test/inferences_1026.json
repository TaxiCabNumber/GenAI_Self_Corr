He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?",
        "inference": "1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. \n\n2. He can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe. \n\n3. He can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, so he can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. \n\n4. So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore per day. \n\n5. In a month with 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore.\nI hope it is correct: 43200",
