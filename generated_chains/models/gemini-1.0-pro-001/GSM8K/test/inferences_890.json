At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?",
        "inference": "1. One-fourth of Mrs. Smith's plants are indoor plants, so there are 100 * 1/4 = 25 indoor plants.\n\n\n2. The remaining plants are 100 - 25 = 75 plants.\n\n\n3. Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so there are 75 * 2/3 = 50 outdoor plants.\n\n\n4. The remaining plants are 75 - 50 = 25 plants.\n\n\n5. Therefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants.\nI hope it is correct: 25%",
        "ground_truth": "There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.\nSo, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.\nThere are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.\nAnd 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.\nThus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.\n#### 25"
