At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  Each bedroom has 2 windows each.  There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.  How many total windows are there between the houses?",
