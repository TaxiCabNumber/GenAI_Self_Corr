At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.\n2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is. So, the house is $60 * 7 = 420$ inches tall.\n3. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. So, the first-floor ceiling is $60 * 3 = 180$ inches high.\n4. The roof from the second floor's floor is the difference between the total height of the house and the height of the first floor. So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is $420 - 180 = 240$ inches.\n\nI hope it is correct: 240",
        "ground_truth": "Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.\nThe floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.\nHence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.\n#### 240"
