At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA three-toed sloth moves very slowly, and only eats when he is up in his tree.  For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up into his tree.  Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?",
        "inference": "1. The sloth takes 4 hours to make one trip, and he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. So, he needs to make 2 trips.\n2. If he collects the same number of berries on each trip, and he needs to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, he needs to collect 12 berries on each trip.\nI hope it is correct: 12",
        "ground_truth": "If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.\nTo collect 24 berries per 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 berries per trip.\n#### 12"
