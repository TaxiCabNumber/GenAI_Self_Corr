At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhen the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWhen the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. \n\nWhen the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long, which is $2(16)+2 = 34$ minutes. \n\nTherefore, Ray takes $34-16 = 18$ minutes more to swim a mile when the water is warm. \n\nTo swim 3 miles when the water is warm, Ray will take $34 \\times 3 = 102$ minutes. \n\nTo swim 3 miles when the water is cold, Ray will take $16 \\times 3 = 48$ minutes. \n\nSo, Ray takes $102-48 = \\boxed{54}$ minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.\nI hope it is correct: 54",
