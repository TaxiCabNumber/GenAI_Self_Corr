At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBilly is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n1. Calculate the number of days between March 1st and April 19th:\n   - April 19th is the 109th day of the year.\n   - March 1st is the 60th day of the year.\n   - Number of days = 109 - 60 = 49 days.\n\n2. Calculate the number of days Billy works:\n   - Billy takes 20% of 49 days off, which is 0.2 * 49 = 9.8 days.\n   - Billy works for 49 - 9.8 = 39.2 days.\n\n3. Calculate the number of hours Billy works:\n   - Billy works for 3 hours a day, so he works for 39.2 * 3 = 117.6 hours.\n\n4. Calculate the number of people Billy helps:\n   - Billy can help 2 people per hour, so he can help 2 * 117.6 = 235.2 people.\n\n5. Round the answer to the nearest whole number, since you cannot help a fraction of a person:\n   - 235.2 rounded to the nearest whole number is 235.\n\nI hope it is correct: 235",
        "ground_truth": "First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days\nThen subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%\nThen multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days\nThen find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day\nThen multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people\n#### 240"
