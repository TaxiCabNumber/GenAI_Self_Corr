At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPrince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.  Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  But Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.  How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?",

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.  Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew (1/5) * 150 = 30 dragons.\nI hope it is correct: he has slain 30 dragons",
