At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGriffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?",
        "inference": "1. Griffin started with 24 fries.\n 2. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. \n3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries, leaving Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.\n 4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, but we don't know how many.  Let's call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin 'x'. So now Griffin has 9 + x fries.\n5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. So Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries, leaving Griffin with (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.\n 6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries. So, 7 + x = 27.\n 7. Solving for x, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20.\n Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.\n\nI hope it is correct: Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.",
