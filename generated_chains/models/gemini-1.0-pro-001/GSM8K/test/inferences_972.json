She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Then she kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest. How many oranges did Mrs. Harrington sell if each box contains 20 oranges?",

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 240/4 = 60 oranges.\n4. She sold the rest, which is 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.\nI hope it is correct: 140",
