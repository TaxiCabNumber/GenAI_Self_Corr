An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. How many cents does Grayson earn from recycling in a four-week month?",
        "inference": "1. Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda a week, so in a four-week month, she drinks 3 * 4 = 12 aluminum cans.\n2. Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week, so in a four-week month, she drinks 5 * 4 = 20 plastic bottles.\n3. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, so 12 aluminum cans are worth 12 * 2 = 24 cents.\n4. Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents, so 20 plastic bottles are worth 20 * 3 = 60 cents.\n5. Grayson earns a total of 24 + 60 = 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.\nI hope it is correct: 84",
        "ground_truth": "Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.\nShe earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cents from water bottles a week.\nThus, she earns 6 + 15 = <<6+15=21>>21 cents from recycling each week.\nIn a four week month, she earns 21 * 4 = <<21*4=84>>84 cents from recycling.\n#### 84"
