At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJen decides to travel to 3 different countries.  He has to pay $400 for the supplies he needs, in total.  The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.  How much does travel cost?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the cost of the supplies\n\nThe cost of the supplies is $400.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the cost of the tickets\n\nThe cost of the tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies, so it is $400 x 1.5 = $600.\n\n**Step 3:** Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the tickets to get the total cost of travel\n\nThe total cost of travel is $400 + $600 = $1000.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1000",
        "ground_truth": "He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies\nThat means the tickets cost 400+200=$<<400+200=600>>600\nSo it cost 600+400=$<<600+400=1000>>1000 in total.\n#### 1000"
