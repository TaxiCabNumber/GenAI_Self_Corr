At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBeatrice bought ten packets of crayons for her Art class. Six of the packets had eight pieces of colors each, and the other four packets had sixteen pieces of colors each. How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?",
