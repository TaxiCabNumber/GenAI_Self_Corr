Multiply the number of half-hour intervals by the number of bottles of water John drinks in each half hour.\n\n4. **Solve the problem.**\n\n1. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku puzzle, which takes 45 minutes. So, an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.\n2. There are 180 minutes / 30 minutes/half-hour = 6 half-hour intervals in 180 minutes.\n3. John drinks 1 bottle of water every half hour, so in 6 half-hour intervals, he drinks 6 * 1 = 6 bottles of water.\n\n5. **Check the solution.**\n\nThe solution is reasonable because John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, and an extreme sudoku puzzle takes 6 half-hour intervals to solve.\n\nI hope it is correct: 6",
