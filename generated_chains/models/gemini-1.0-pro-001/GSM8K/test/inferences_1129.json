        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nLet x be the number of eggs that Arnold and Madeline each painted.\nThen we have x + x + 30 = 56, since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.\nSimplifying this equation, we get 2x + 30 = 56.\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 26.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 13.\nNow, since Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and Sarah painted x eggs, Camden painted x + 12 eggs.\nTherefore, Camden painted 13 + 12 = 25 eggs.\nSo, Camden painted 25 - 13 = 12 more eggs than Arnold.\nI hope it is correct: 12",
