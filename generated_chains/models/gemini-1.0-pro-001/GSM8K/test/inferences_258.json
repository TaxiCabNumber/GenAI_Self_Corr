At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?",
        "inference": "1) First, calculate the total amount of cents Nancy owes for the overdue books: 8 x $0.50 = $4.00\n2) Then, add the flat $2.00 fee: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00\nI hope it is correct: $6.00",
        "ground_truth": "First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00\nThen add the \"more than a week overdue\" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00\n#### 6"
