At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nChris has a two-speed lawn mower. He can mow his entire lawn in \"turtle\" mode in 1 hour, or 40 minutes in \"rabbit\" mode. Today, he experimented by mowing half in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. How many minutes did it take him to mow the lawn?",
