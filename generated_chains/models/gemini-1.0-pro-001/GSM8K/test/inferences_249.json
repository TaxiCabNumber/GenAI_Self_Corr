At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.**\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of calories Sue consumed.**\n\nSue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.\n\nEach cookie has 200 calories, so Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9,200 calories.\n\n**Step 3: Find the total number of calories Sue's sister consumed.**\n\nSue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.\n\nEach cookie has 200 calories, so Sue's sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3,600 calories.\n\n**Step 4: Find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister.**\n\nSue consumed 9,200 calories, while her sister consumed 3,600 calories.\n\nTherefore, Sue consumed 9,200 - 3,600 = 5,600 more calories than her sister.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 5600**",
