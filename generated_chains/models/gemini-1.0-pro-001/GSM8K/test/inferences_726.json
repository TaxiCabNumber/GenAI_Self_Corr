        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTopher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher\u2019s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby\u2019s shoes?",
        "inference": "We are told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as:\n$$T = 9B + 10$$\nwhere $T$ is the length of one of Topher's shoes and $B$ is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.\n\nWe are also told that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. We can convert this to inches by multiplying by 12:\n$$T = 8 \\cdot 12 + 4 = 96 \\text{ inches}$$\nSubstituting this value of $T$ into the first equation, we get:\n$$96 = 9B + 10$$\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get:\n$$86 = 9B$$\nDividing both sides by 9, we get:\n$$B = \\frac{86}{9} = 9.56 \\text{ inches}$$\nI hope it is correct: $9.56$",
        "ground_truth": "Since Topher\u2019s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher\u2019s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10"
