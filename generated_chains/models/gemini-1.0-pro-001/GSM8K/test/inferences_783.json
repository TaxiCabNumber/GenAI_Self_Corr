At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBob had 7 fish in his ornamental fish pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. He decided he wanted to get some more, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of white fish Bob bought at the store. \nSo, the number of orange fish he bought at the store = 17 - x. \nNow, the total number of white fish Bob has now = 4 + x. \nAnd, the total number of orange fish Bob now has = 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x.\nGiven that Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we have:\n20 - x = 2(4 + x)\n20 - x = 8 + 2x\n3x = 12\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.\n\nI hope it is correct: 4.",
