At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMelissa works as a pet groomer. This week, she has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, 5 cats that need their nails clipped, 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, and 12 horses that need to be brushed. If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?",
        "inference": "1. Add up the total number of animals: 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28\n2. Since there are 7 days in a week, divide the total number of animals by 7 to find the number of animals she will groom each day: 28 \u00f7 7 = 4\nI hope it is correct: 4",
        "ground_truth": "Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.\nTherefore, She will groom 28 / 7 = <<28/7=4>>4 animals each day.\n#### 4"
