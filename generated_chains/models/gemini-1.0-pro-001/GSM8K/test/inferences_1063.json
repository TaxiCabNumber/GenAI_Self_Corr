He responds to the rest of them.  How many emails does he respond to in a 5 day work week?",

Calculate the number of emails that require a response: 80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails\n4. Multiply the number of emails that require a response by the number of days in a work week: 64 emails * 5 days = 320 emails\n\nI hope it is correct: 320 emails",
