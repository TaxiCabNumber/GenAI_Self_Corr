At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJean is two years older than Mark.  Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.  If Jan is 30 how old is Jean?",
        "inference": "1. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age: \nMark's age 2 years ago = half of Jean's age at the time - 5\n2. Jean is two years older than Mark: \nJean's age = Mark's age + 2\n\n3. Given that Jean is currently 30: \nJean's age = 30\n\n4. Substituting Jean's age into the equation from step 2: \n30 = Mark's age + 2\nSolving for Mark's age: \nMark's age = 28\n\n5. Substituting Mark's age into the equation from step 1 and solving for Jean's age at the time: \n28 = half of Jean's age at the time - 5\n56 = half of Jean's age at the time\nJean's age at the time = 112 \n\n6. Adding the two years that have passed since then: \nJean's current age = 112 + 2\nI hope it is correct: Jean's current age is 32.",
