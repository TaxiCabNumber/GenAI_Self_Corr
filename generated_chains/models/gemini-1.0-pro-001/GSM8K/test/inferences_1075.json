At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJenny goes to the florist to buy some flowers. Roses cost $2 each and $15 for a dozen. If she bought 15 roses and arrived with five 5 dollar bills and they only have quarters for change, how many quarters does she leave with?",

Find the number of dozens of roses she bought.\n15 roses / 12 roses/dozen = 1.25 dozens\n4. Find the cost of the dozens of roses.\n1.25 dozens * $1.25/dozen = $1.5625\n5.
