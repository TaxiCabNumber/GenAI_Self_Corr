He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?",

Calculate the amount of the discount.\n$1,200 x 0.20 = $240\n\n4. Calculate the total cost of the fireworks after the discount.\n$1,200 - $240 = $960\n\n5.
