At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSophia is thinking of taking a road trip in her car, and would like to know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. She has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. The owner's manual for her car says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?",
        "inference": "Since she already has driven 100 miles and put 4 gallons in, the total number of gallons used is 4 + 8 = 12.  Since Sophia's car's tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive (12/4) * 100 = 300 miles on a single tank of gas.\nI hope it is correct: 300",
        "ground_truth": "To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon\nTo find how far Olivia can go on a single tank, multiply 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = <<25*12=300>>300 miles\n#### 300"
