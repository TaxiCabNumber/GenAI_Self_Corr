Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?",

Calculate the number of cookies given to the church:**\n\n1500 cookies * 1/2 = 750 cookies\n\n**3. Divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:**\n\n750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = **50 people**\n\nI hope it is correct: 50",
