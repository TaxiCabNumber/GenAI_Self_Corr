At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Sasha paid $10 per board for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she paid $10 * 10 = $100 for all ten boards. \n2. Sasha paid $16 per board for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she paid $16 * 5 = $80 for all five boards.\n3. Sasha paid $100 + $80 = $180 for all the boards.\n4. The lumber prices have gone up 50%, so the new price is $180 * 1.5 = $270.\n5. Sasha's profit is the new price minus the old price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.\nI hope it is correct: $90$",
