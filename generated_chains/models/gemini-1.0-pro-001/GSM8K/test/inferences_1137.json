At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDonny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",
        "inference": "The 4 ounces of water from the 33 degree mug decreases the overall water temperature by 4 times 33 = 132 degrees. The 1 ounce of water from the second mug increased the overall water temperature. To compensate for the 132deg decrease, the second mug must have increased the overall water temperature by 132 degrees. \nSince the second mug's volume is 1 ounce, the required water temperature must be 132 degrees.\nI hope it's correct: 132",
