At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFrankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?",
        "inference": "- Frankie watched a 1-hour episode on Monday, so that is 1 hour.\n- Frankie watched a 1-hour episode on Tuesday, so that is 1 hour.\n- Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday, so let's say he watched x episodes.\n- Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show on Thursday, so that is 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours.\n- Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes on Friday, so that is 2 hours.\n\nSo, the total number of hours Frankie watched TV is 1 + 1 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 hours.\n\nWe know that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all, so we can solve for x:\n\n1 + 1 + x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\nx + 3.5 = 7\nx = 7 - 3.5\nx = 3.5\n\nFrankie watched 3.5 30-minute episodes on Wednesday. Since he can't watch half an episode, he must have watched 3 episodes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3"
