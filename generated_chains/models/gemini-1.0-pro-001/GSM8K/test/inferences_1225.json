At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assume Carly makes x cupcakes.\n2. According to the problem, she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so she makes 3x - 2 brownies.\n3. We know that Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, so she needs to make a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.\n4. Since Carly makes cupcakes and brownies, the total number of treats she makes is equal to x + (3x - 2) = 4x - 2.\n5. To find the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to solve the equation 4x - 2 = 10.\n6. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation gives us 4x = 12.\n7. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives us x = 3.\nI hope it is correct: 3",
        "ground_truth": "First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats\nNext, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes\nWe know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10\nNow we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10\nWe add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12\nFinally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3\n#### 3"
