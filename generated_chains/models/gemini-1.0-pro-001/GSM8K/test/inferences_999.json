At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of slices: Two adults will get 2 slices, and four kids will get 4 slices, for a total of 6 slices.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the ratio of adult slices to kid slices: Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid. Therefore, the ratio is 2:1.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the size of each adult slice: The adult slices are twice as big as the kid slices, so each adult slice is 2/3 of the total watermelon (2 slices / 3 slices).\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets: Each adult gets 2/3 of the watermelon, which is equivalent to 66.67%.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 66.67%$",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25"
