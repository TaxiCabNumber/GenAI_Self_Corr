At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMax plans to watch two movies this weekend. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long while the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. How many minutes will it take Max to watch the two movies?",
        "inference": "- Convert the first movie's time to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes, 30 minutes = 30 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.\n\n- Convert the second movie's time to minutes: 2 hours = 120 minutes, 5 minutes = 5 minutes, so 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.\n\n- Add the minutes from both movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.\n\n- Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.\nI hope it is correct: 215",
        "ground_truth": "One hour has 60 minutes.\nThe first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.\nTwo hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.\nThe second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.\nMax will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.\n#### 215"
