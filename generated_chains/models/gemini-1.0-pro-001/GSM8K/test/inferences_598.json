At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nColby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?",
        "inference": "1. Convert all the coins to nickels:\n - 8 quarters = 8 x 5 = 40 nickels\n - 6 dimes = 6 x 2 = 12 nickels\n - 14 nickels = 14 nickels\n - 15 pennies = 15 pennies (since a penny is worth less than a nickel, we can't convert it to nickels)\n\n2. Add up the number of nickels: 40 + 12 + 14 + 15 = 81 nickels\n\n3. Divide the number of nickels by the cost of each gumball: 81 nickels / 5 nickels per gumball = 16.2 gumballs\n\nI hope it is correct: 16",
        "ground_truth": "He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.\nHe has $.6 in dimes because 6 times .1 equals <<6*.1=.6>>.6\nHe has $.7 in nickels because 14 times .05 equals .7\nHe has $.15 in pennies because 15 times .01 equals <<15*.01=.15>>.15\nHe has $3.65 because 2 plus .6 plus .7 plus .15 equals $<<2+.6+.7+.15=3.45>>3.45\nHe can buy 69 gum balls because 3.65 divided by .05 equals 69\n#### 69"
