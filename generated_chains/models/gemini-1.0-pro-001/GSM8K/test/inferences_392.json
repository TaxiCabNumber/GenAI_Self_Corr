At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services.  He gets Netflix for $10 a month.  Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a month each but he saves 20% for bundling.  How much money does he save by cancelling his $60 cable package?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the cost of the streaming services:\nNetflix: $10 per month\nHulu: $10 x 0.8 = $8 per month\nDisney Plus: $10 x 0.8 = $8 per month\nTotal cost of streaming services: $10 + $8 + $8 = $26 per month\n\n2. Calculate the savings:\nSavings = Cost of cable - Cost of streaming services\nSavings = $60 - $26\nSavings = $34\n\nI hope it is correct: $34",
        "ground_truth": "Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20\nBy bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4\nSo in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16\nSo he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming\nThat means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month\n#### 34"
