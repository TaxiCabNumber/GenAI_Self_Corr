        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGeorge needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He\u2019s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the implants: $2000 x 2 = $4000\n2. Add the cost of the porcelain crown: $4000 + $500 = $4500\n3. Subtract the deposit: $4500 - $600 = $3900\n4. Divide the remaining balance by the hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours\n\nI hope it is correct: 260 hours",
        "ground_truth": "The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nAdding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.\nSubtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.\nThis means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.\n#### 260"
