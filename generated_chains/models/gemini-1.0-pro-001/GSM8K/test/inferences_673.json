At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJaney has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of books Sally has \"x\".\nAccording to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, in equation form, we can write this as:\nJaney's books = 3 + 2 * Sally's books\nWe know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n21 = 3 + 2 * x\nNow we can solve for x, Sally's number of books:\n21 - 3 = 2 * x\n18 = 2 * x\nx = 18 / 2\nx = 9\nI hope it is correct: Sally has 9 books",
        "ground_truth": "Let x be the number of books that Sally has\nJaney has 3+2x books\n3+2x=21\n2x=18\nx=<<9=9>>9\n#### 9"
