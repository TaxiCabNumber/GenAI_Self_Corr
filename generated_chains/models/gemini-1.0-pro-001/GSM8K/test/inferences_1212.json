At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAli is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali\u2019s class which has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFirst, I need to find the capacity of Ali's class. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.\n\nNext, I need to find the capacity of each of John's two classes. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, so each class has a capacity of 120 * 1/8 = 15 students.\n\nFinally, I need to find the combined capacity of both schools. The combined capacity is the sum of the capacities of Ali's class and John's two classes. So, the combined capacity is 120 + 15 + 15 = 150 students.\n\nI hope it is correct: The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.",
