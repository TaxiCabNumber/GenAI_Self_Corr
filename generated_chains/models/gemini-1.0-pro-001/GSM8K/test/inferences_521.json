At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nChris is way behind on his math homework. He has 100 math problems to complete in total. He completes 12 problems on Monday night. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?",

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, so he completes $3 \\cdot 12 = 36$ problems.\n3. He has a total of $100$ problems to complete, so after completing $12 + 36 = 48$ problems, he has $100 - 48 = 52$ problems left.\n4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems, so he completes $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 52 = 13$ problems.\n5. Therefore, he has $52 - 13 = \\boxed{39}$ problems left to complete on Thursday.\n\nI hope it is correct: 39",
