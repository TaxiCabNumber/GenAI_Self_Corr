At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?",
        "inference": "- John has 6 periods in a day, and each period is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 6 * 40 = 240 minutes in class each day.\n- He has 2 extra classes, so he spends 2 * 40 = 80 minutes in extra classes each day.\n- He goes to class for 5 days a week, so he spends 240 * 5 + 80 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.\n- He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday. So, he spends 1600 / 16 * 2 = 200 minutes in extra learning time each week.\n- Therefore, he spends a total of 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week.\n- 1800 minutes is equal to 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.\nI hope it is correct: 30",
        "ground_truth": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday\nSo he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week\nSo he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week\n#### 30"
