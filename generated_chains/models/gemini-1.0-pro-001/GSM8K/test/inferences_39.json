        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the rate at which Dana runs.  Since she runs at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run, we can set up the following equation:  \n```\nRunning rate = 2 * Skipping rate = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph\n```\n\n**Step 2**: Calculate the distance Dana covers while running.  She spends one-third of the time running, which is 2 hours, so the distance she covers while running is:  \n```\nDistance covered while running = Running rate * Time spent running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Calculate the distance Dana covers while walking.  She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 4 hours, so the distance she covers while walking is:  \n```\nDistance covered while walking = Walking rate * Time spent walking = 3 mph * 4 hours = 12 miles\n```\n\n**Step 4**: Add the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana travels.  \n```\nTotal distance traveled = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles\n```\nI hope it is correct: 24 miles",
        "ground_truth": "If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.\nIf one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18"
