At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nNate's dog can dig six holes a day. He digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation. When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. How many weeks does it take him to fill in all the holes?",

Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so Nate actually fills in 9 - 6 = 3 holes a day.\n3. So, it takes Nate 84 / 3 = 28 days to fill in all the holes.\n4. 28 days is 4 weeks, so the answer is 4.\n\nI hope it is correct: 4",
        "ground_truth": "First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes\nThen find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day\nThen divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days\nThen divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks\n#### 4"
