        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?",
        "inference": "- First, find the volume of the jar: 6 in x 6 in x 15 in = 540 cubic inches\n- Then, find the volume of each jelly bean: 0.15 cubic inches\n- Multiply the volume of the jar by 80% to account for packing efficiency: 540 cubic inches x 0.80 = 432 cubic inches\n- Divide the volume of the jar by the volume of each jelly bean to find the maximum number of jelly beans that can fit: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches = 2880 jelly beans\n- Multiply the maximum number of jelly beans by 30% to estimate the number of red jelly beans: 2880 jelly beans x 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans\n- Find the difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the true number of red jelly beans: 864 jelly beans - 900 jelly beans = -36 jelly beans\n- The guess was 36 jelly beans too low.\n\nI hope it is correct: -36 jelly beans",
        "ground_truth": "The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches\nThat means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans\nWith 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there\nSo that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red\nSo his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36\n#### 36"
