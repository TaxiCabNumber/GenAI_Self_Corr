At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJay is making snowballs to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the rate at which Jay makes snowballs**\nJay makes 20 snowballs in an hour. In 15 minutes (0.25 hours), he makes 5 snowballs (20 * 0.25 = 5).\n\n**Step 2: Find the rate at which snowballs melt**\n2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. In 1 hour (4 quarters), 8 snowballs melt (2 * 4 = 8).\n\n**Step 3: Find the net rate at which Jay gains snowballs**\nJay gains 5 snowballs every 15 minutes, but loses 8 snowballs every hour. Therefore, his net gain is -3 snowballs every hour (5 - 8 = -3).\n\n**Step 4: Find the time it takes to make 60 snowballs**\nTo make 60 snowballs, Jay needs to gain 60 snowballs. At a rate of -3 snowballs per hour, it will take him 20 hours to make 60 snowballs (60 / -3 = 20).\n\nI hope it is correct: **20**",
        "ground_truth": "Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.\nAt the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.\nThis means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 \u2013 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.\nIt will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.\n#### 5"
