At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGeb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, how old is Geb?",
        "inference": "1. Haley's age is given as 26 years.\n\n2. Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age.\n\n3. Mathematically, Geb's age can be expressed as:\nGeb's age = (1/2) x Haley's age - 10\n\n4. Substituting Haley's age as 26 years in the above expression:\nGeb's age = (1/2) x 26 - 10\n\n5. Simplifying the expression:\nGeb's age = 13 - 10\n\n6. Calculating Geb's age:\nGeb's age = 3 years\n\nI hope it is correct: Geb's age is 3 years",
        "ground_truth": "Half of Haley's age is 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13.\nSo Geb is 13 - 10 = <<13-10=3>>3 years old.\n#### 3"
