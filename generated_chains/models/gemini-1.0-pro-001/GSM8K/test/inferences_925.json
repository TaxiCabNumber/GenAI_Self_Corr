At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?",

Therefore, there are 5000 gallons of water in the tank.\n4. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.\n5. Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 5000 - 6 * 500 = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.\nI hope it is correct: 2000",
