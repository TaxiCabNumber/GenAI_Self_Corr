At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this (smallest) group?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of students in each of the two equal groups x.\nSince the last group is 10 less than each of the other groups, there are x - 10 students in the last group.\nSince the class has a total of 200 students, we have:\nx + x + (x - 10) = 200\n2x + x - 10 = 200\n3x - 10 = 200\n3x = 210\nx = 70\nTherefore, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.\nI hope it is correct: 60",
        "ground_truth": "If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.\nNow taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.\n#### 60"
