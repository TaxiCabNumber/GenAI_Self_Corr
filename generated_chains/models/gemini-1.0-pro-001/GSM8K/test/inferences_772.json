At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTatiana is deciding how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. She is dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?",

Calculate the amount of time Tatiana will spend on video games:\n\u2153 of (12 hours - 3 hours for reading) = \u2153 of 9 hours = 3 hours\n\n3. Determine the amount of time left for soccer: \n12 hours (total time) - 3 hours (reading) - 3 hours (video games) = 6 hours\n\n4. Find the percentage of the weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:\n(6 hours of soccer / 12 hours of total time) \u00d7 100 = 50%\n\nI hope it is correct: 50 %",
