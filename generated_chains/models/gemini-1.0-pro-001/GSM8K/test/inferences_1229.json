At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn November, a toy was $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. In January, the price decreased by 50%. What was the price of the toy after it was discounted in January?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Find the price in December after the 80% increase:\n\n```\n40 * 1.80 = 72\n```\n\n2. Find the discount amount in January:\n\n```\n72 * 0.50 = 36\n```\n\n3. Subtract the discount amount from the December price to find the January price:\n\n```\n72 - 36 = 36\n```\n\n**Final Answer:** I hope it is correct: $36",
        "ground_truth": "In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.\nThe 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32\nIn December, the toy's price was 40 + 32 = $<<40+32=72>>72.\nThe 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36\nIn January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.\n#### 36"
