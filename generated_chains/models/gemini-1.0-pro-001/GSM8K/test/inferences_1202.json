At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAmy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?",
        "inference": "1. Amy has two palettes with four colors each, so she has 8 colors from the palettes.\n2. She has three makeup sets with six colors each, so she has 18 colors from the makeup sets.\n3. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors.\n4. She uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, so she loses 3 colors.\n5. Therefore, she has 8 + 18 - 4 - 3 = 17 eyeshadow colors left.\nI hope it is correct: 17",
        "ground_truth": "Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.\nHer sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.\nHalf the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.\nThus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.\n#### 19"
