At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides.  How long does the Rubik's cube take?",
