At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSamwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of smart TVs sold.**\nOne-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so:\n40 TVs * 1/4 = 10 smart TVs\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of analog TVs sold.**\nOne-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so:\n40 TVs * 1/8 = 5 analog TVs\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs sold.**\n40 TVs - 10 smart TVs - 5 analog TVs = 25 OLED TVs\n\nI hope it is correct: 25",
        "ground_truth": "Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.\nHe was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.\nSo, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.\nTherefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.\n#### 25"
