So, x + 14 = 3 * 8.\n\n**Step 4**: Solving for x, we get x + 14 = 24.\n\n**Step 5**: Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get x = 24 - 14.\n\n**Step 6**: Calculating the value of x, we get x = 10.\n\n**Conclusion**: Erin had 10 points before scoring the 14 additional points.\nI hope it is correct: Erin had 10 points before.",
