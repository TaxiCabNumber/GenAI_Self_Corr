        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?",
        "inference": "She started with 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so she had 3 * 5 = 15 petals.\nThen she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so she had 4 * 6 = 24 more petals.\nShe then added 5 flowers with 4 petals each, so she had 5 * 4 = 20 more petals.\nLastly she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so she had 6 * 7 = 42 more petals.\nIn total, she had 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.\nShe dropped 1 of each, so she had 1 less of each flower.\nTherefore, she has 2 less 5-petal flowers (15 - 2 = 13 petals), 3 less 6-petal flowers (24 - 3 = 21 petals), 4 less 4-petal flowers (20 - 4 = 16 petals), and 5 less 7-petal flowers (42 - 5 = 37 petals).\nIn total, she has 13 + 21 + 16 + 37 = 87 petals in the vase.\nI hope it is correct: 87 $answer$",
        "ground_truth": "Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.\nRose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.\nFinally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.\nRose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.\nBut the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.\nSo Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining\n#### 79"
