At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMorgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The Go-karts cost $10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?",

She has $90, so she can spend $80 on her friends.\n5. Each friend gets $5 in arcade tokens and rides the go-karts twice, which costs $20.\n6. She can invite 4 friends.\nI hope it is correct: 4",
        "ground_truth": "The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20\nEach person costs $30 because 5 + 5 + 20 = <<5+5+20=30>>30\nThree total people can attend because 90 / 30 = <<90/30=3>>3\nShe can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2\n#### 2"
