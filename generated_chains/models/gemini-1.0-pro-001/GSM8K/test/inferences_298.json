At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk. She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time and 3 other people each bid once. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?",
