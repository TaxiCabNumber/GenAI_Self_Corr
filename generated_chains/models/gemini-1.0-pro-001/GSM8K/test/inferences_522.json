Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour, while Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.  Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, and Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy.  In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?",
        "inference": "Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. \nBobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour. \nKathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 x 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour. \nRicky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour. \nIn total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 29",
        "ground_truth": "Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.\nKathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.\nRicky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour.
