        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?",
        "inference": "1.  Every flower is 12 inches wide, which is the equivalent of 1 foot.\n\n2.  Since Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, each plant will take up 2.5 feet of space (1 foot for the plant and 1.5 feet for the space between plants).\n\n3.  To find out how many plants will fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up: 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4 plants.\n\n4.  Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to buy 44.4 - 17 = 27.4 more plants.\n\n5.  Each plant costs $6, so to find the total cost, we need to multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant: 27.4 plants * $6 / plant = $164.4\n\nI hope it is correct: $164.4",
        "ground_truth": "Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.\nPat needs to buy 74 plants - 17 plants = <<74-17=57>>57 plants needed to purchase.\nPat will spend 57 plants * $6 = $<<57*6=342>>342.\n#### 342"
