If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much money is Andy's car consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles?",

Multiply the daily distance by the number of workdays in a week (Monday to Friday): 10 miles per day * 5 days = 50 miles per week.\n3. Divide the weekly distance by the car's fuel efficiency: 50 miles per week / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons per week. \n4.
