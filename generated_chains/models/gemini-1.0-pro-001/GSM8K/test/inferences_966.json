She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?",

So in total, she had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.  So, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left over.\n\nI hope it is correct: 48",
