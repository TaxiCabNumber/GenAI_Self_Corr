At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?",
        "inference": "The cost of the manicure is $35 x 0.80 = $28.\nThe cost of the pedicure is $40 x 0.80 = $32.\nThe cost of the nail art is $3 x 10 = $30.\nThe total cost is $28 + $32 + $30 = $90.\nI hope it is correct: $90",
        "ground_truth": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90"
