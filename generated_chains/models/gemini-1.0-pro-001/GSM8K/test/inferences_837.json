        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nErika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?",
        "inference": "1. The cost of the new laptop without trade in: $600\n2. The reduction in price for trading in the old laptop: $200\n3. The cost of the new laptop after trade in: $600 - $200 = $400\n4. The amount of money Erika already has: $150 (from her part-time job) + $80 (from her mom) = $230\n5. The amount of money Erika still needs: $400 (cost of the laptop after trade in) - $230 (amount of money Erika already has) = $170\n6. The amount of money Erika needs to have in her purse: $170 (amount of money Erika still needs) - $50 (extra money Erika needs) = $120\n**I hope it is correct: $120$**",
