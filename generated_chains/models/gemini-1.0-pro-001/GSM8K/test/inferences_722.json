At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRon is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Ron will pay $120 for the fine.\n2. Ron will pay 3 x $25 = $75 for the asphalt.\n3. Ron will save $450 - $120 - $75 = $255 by fixing the pothole.\n\nI hope it is correct: $255",
        "ground_truth": "First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75\nNow subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255\n#### 255"
