At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPeter has $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?",
        "inference": "Here is the solution:\n\n1. Calculate how much money Peter can spend on wooden action figures: $70 \u00f7 7 = $10 per day\n2. Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy with $10: $10 \u00f7 $5 = 2 action figures per day\n3. Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy in 4 days: 2 action figures per day x 4 days = 8 action figures\n4. Calculate how much money Peter has left after buying wooden action figures: $70 - ($10 x 4) = $30\n5. Calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy with $30: $30 \u00f7 $2 = 15 action figures\n6. Add the number of wooden and plastic action figures Peter will have: 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures\n\n**I hope it is correct: 23**",
