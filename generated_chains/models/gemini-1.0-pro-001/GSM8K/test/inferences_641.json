At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?",

Find the amount of the bonus: 0.5 * $21000 = $10500\n4. Add the bonus to the new salary: $21000 + $10500 = $31500\n5. Multiply the new monthly salary by the number of months in a year: $31500 * 12 = $378000\nI hope it is correct : 378000 $",
