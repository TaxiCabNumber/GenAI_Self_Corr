Calculate the total amount of money Frances made from selling cookies: $40 \\times $1 = $40$.\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Frances spent on trays: $5 \\times $4 = $20$.\n4. Calculate the total amount of money Frances has left: $40 + $40 - $20 = $60$.\n\nI hope it is correct: 60 $",
        "ground_truth": "20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.\n40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.\nSo, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.\nThe cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nTherefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.\n#### 60"
