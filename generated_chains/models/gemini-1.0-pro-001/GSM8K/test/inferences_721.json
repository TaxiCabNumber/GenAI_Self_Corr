At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHelga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?",

        "ground_truth": "During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.\nWith hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.\nWith hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.\nWith hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nWith hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.\nThus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times\n#### 2450"
