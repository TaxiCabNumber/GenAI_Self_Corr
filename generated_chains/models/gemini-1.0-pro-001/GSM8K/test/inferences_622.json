At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim has a 20 pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?",
        "inference": "Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school.  He's at school for 8 hours.  So, he chews $8/2 = 4$ pieces of gum at school.\n\nAfter school, he chews 1 piece of gum on the way home and 1 stick after dinner.  So, he chews a total of $4 + 1 + 1 = 6$ pieces of gum.\n\nHe gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister.  He has 20 pieces of gum, and he has chewed 6 pieces of gum, so he has $20 - 6 = 14$ pieces of gum left.  He gives half of these to his sister, so he gives $14/2 = 7$ pieces of gum to his sister.\n\nTherefore, Jim has $14 - 7 = \\boxed{7}$ pieces of gum left at the end of the day.\nI hope it is correct: 7",
