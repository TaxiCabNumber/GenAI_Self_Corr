At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nFord owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops every month?",

Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all three flower shops per month.\n20 roses x 1 month = 20 roses/month\n15 roses x 1 month = 15 roses/month\n30 roses x 1 month = 30 roses/month\nTotal = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/month\n\n3. Determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.\n160 roses/month - 65 roses/month = 95 roses/month\n\nI hope it is correct: 95",
