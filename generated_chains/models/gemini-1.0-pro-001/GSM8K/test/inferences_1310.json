At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAaron and Vanessa were relay race partners on a running team. Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes did Vanessa take to complete her part?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\n1) Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, he would take half the time to run a mile that Vanessa would take to run a mile. So, if Vanessa takes x minutes to run a mile, Aaron would take x/2 minutes to run a mile.\n\n2) Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, she would have taken 4x minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\n3) Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he would take x/2 minutes to run a mile, he must have run a distance of 16/(x/2) = 32/x miles.\n\n4) Since Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did, she must have run 2 * (32/x) = 64/x miles.\n\n5) Therefore, it would have taken Vanessa 4x minutes to complete her part of the race.\n\nI hope it is correct: 64",
