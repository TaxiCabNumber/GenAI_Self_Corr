At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to take a cooking class.  The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, how many recipes does he learn?",

Calculate the number of 1.5-hour blocks of class time: 48 hours / 1.5 hours/block = 32 blocks\n3. Calculate the number of recipes he learns: 32 blocks * 1 recipe/block = 32 recipes\nI hope it is correct: 32 recipes",
        "ground_truth": "He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week\nSo he takes classes for 8*6=<<8*6=48>>48 hours\nThat means he learned 48/1.5=<<48/1.5=32>>32 recipes\n#### 32"
