The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?",

So, 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.\n4- Brittany has 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.\n5- Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.\n6- Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the comforter measures 68 square feet.\nI hope it is correct: 68 square feet",
