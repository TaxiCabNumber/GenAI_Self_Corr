At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn adopts a dog.  He takes the dog to the groomer, which costs $100.  The groomer offers him a 30% discount for being a new customer.  How much does the grooming cost?",

        "ground_truth": "The groomer gave a 100*.3=$<<100*.3=30>>30 discount\nSo the grooming cost 100-30=$<<100-30=70>>70\n#### 70"
