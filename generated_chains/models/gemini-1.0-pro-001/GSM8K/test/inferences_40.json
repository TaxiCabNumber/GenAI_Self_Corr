        "inference": "Let x be the age of Suzy's iPhone.\nAccording to the given information:\n- Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Ben's iPhone is 2x years old.\n- Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2x = 8x years old.\n\nGiven that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we have:\nx = 1\n\nSubstituting this value of x into the expression for Brandon's iPhone's age, we get:\nBrandon's iPhone's age = 8x = 8 * 1 = 8 years\n\nI hope it is correct: Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.",
