At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?",

Calculate the amount of meat and cheese needed for 5 sandwiches.\n\n5 sandwiches x 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat\n5 sandwiches x 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese\n\n4. Determine the total cost of the meat and cheese.\n\n5 pounds of meat x $7.00 per pound = $35.00\n5 pounds of cheese x $3.00 per pound = $15.00\nTotal cost = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00\n\nI hope it is correct: $50.00$",
