When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?",

Calculate the total earning per day when they make silos:\n 5 silos x $220 per silo = $1100 per day\n3. Calculate the difference in earnings:\n $1100 - $1000 = $100 per day\n4. Calculate the percentage increase:\n $100 / $1000 x 100% = 10%\nI hope it is correct: 10%",
