At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, how many eggs will the family consume in a week?",

The rest of the family (2 people) eat two eggs each day, so they eat a total of 2 * 2 = 4 eggs per day.\n3. The family eats a total of 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.\n4. In a week (7 days), the family will eat a total of 13 * 7 = 91 eggs.\nI hope it is correct: 91",
        "ground_truth": "Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.\nSo, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.\nThus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.\nSo the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.\nTherefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.\n#### 91"
