Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  If Cindy carries all of her books at once, what will be the total weight of the books she is carrying?",

Her French book weighs 4 pounds, so the total weight of the three books is 4 + 4 = 8 pounds.\n\n3. Her English book weighs 3 pounds, so the total weight of the four books is 8 + 3 = 11 pounds.\n\n4. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so the history book weighs 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.\n\n5.
