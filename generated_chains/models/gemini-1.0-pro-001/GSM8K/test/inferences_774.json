At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJack decides to visit a museum 150 miles from home.  He drives 75 mph there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.  How long is he gone from home?",
        "inference": "To find the total length of time Jack is gone from home, we need to determine the time it takes him to drive there and back, and add the time he spends at the museum.\n\n**1. Calculate the time it takes Jack to drive there.**\n\nDistance = 150 miles\nSpeed = 75 mph\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 150 miles / 75 mph\nTime = 2 hours\n\n**2. Calculate the time it takes Jack to drive back.**\n\nDistance = 150 miles\nSpeed = 75 mph\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 150 miles / 75 mph\nTime = 2 hours\n\n**3. Calculate the total time Jack spends driving.**\n\nTotal driving time = Time to drive there + Time to drive back\nTotal driving time = 2 hours + 2 hours\nTotal driving time = 4 hours\n\n**4. Add the total driving time and the time spent at the museum to find the total time Jack is gone from home.**\n\nTotal time gone from home = Total driving time + Time at museum\nTotal time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours\nTotal time gone from home = **10 hours**\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 hours",
        "ground_truth": "He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles\nSo he drove for 300/75=<<300/75=4>>4 hours\nThat means he was gone from home for 4+6=<<4+6=10>>10 hours\n#### 10"
