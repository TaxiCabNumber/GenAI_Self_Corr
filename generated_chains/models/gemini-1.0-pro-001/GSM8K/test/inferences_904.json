At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 9 Fast and the Furious movies, Deepa has seen each one in the theatre three times. She has spent $216 seeing these movies. What is the average price she paid per ticket?",
