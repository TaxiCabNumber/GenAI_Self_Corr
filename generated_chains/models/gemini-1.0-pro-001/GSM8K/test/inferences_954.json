At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.",
        "inference": "First, we need to calculate how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. We know that he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, which is equal to 24 cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:\n\nNumber of measuring spoons = (2/3) x Number of measuring cups\nNumber of measuring spoons = (2/3) x 24\nNumber of measuring spoons = 16\n\nThis means that Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of measuring spoons that he gifted Pedro from the total number of measuring spoons he has. We know that he gifted Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so we can calculate the number of measuring spoons remaining as follows:\n\nNumber of measuring spoons remaining = Total number of measuring spoons - Number of measuring spoons gifted\nNumber of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6\nNumber of measuring spoons remaining = 10\n\nFinally, we need to add the number of measuring cups Jonathan has to the number of measuring spoons remaining to get the total number of utensils he has remaining. We know that he has 24 measuring cups, so we can calculate the total number of utensils as follows:\n\nTotal number of utensils = Number of measuring cups + Number of measuring spoons remaining\nTotal number of utensils = 24 + 10\nTotal number of utensils = 34\nI hope it is correct: $34$",
        "ground_truth": "A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.\nJonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.\nWhen he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.\nHe now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils\n#### 34"
