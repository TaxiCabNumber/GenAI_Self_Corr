At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.\n- The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade, or $2,500.\n- The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, or $2,000.\n- The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.\n\nSo, the total cost of the truck is $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.\n\nI hope it is correct: $43,500$",
