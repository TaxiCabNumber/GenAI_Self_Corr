At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHow much does it cost you for lunch today at Subway if you pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub and thrice as much for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub?",
        "inference": "The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 * $40 = $120. The total cost of lunch is the cost of the foot-long fish sub plus the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. Therefore, the total cost of lunch is $40 + $120 = $160.\nI hope it is correct: 160 $",
