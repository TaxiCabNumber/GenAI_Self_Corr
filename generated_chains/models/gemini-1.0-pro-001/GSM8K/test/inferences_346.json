The bag has 36 cookies and she puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.

So, in a week, she gives her son 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.\n3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. So, in a week, he eats 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.\n4. Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. So, the number of cookies Jenny eats = Total number of cookies - (Number of cookies given to son + Number of cookies eaten by husband)\n5. The total number of cookies is 36, the number of cookies given to her son is 20, and the number of cookies eaten by her husband is 7. So, the number of cookies Jenny eats = 36 - (20 + 7)\n6. Number of cookies Jenny eats = 36 - 27 = 9.\nI hope it is correct: $9$",
