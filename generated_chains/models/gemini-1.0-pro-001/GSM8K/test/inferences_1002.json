At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLisa and Peter are selling chocolate bars door to door. Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold four and a half boxes. They sold 64 chocolate bars together. How many chocolate bars are in a box?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the mixed numbers to fractions:\n3 and 1/2 = 7/2\n4 and 1/2 = 9/2\n\n2. Multiply the number of boxes each person sold by the number of chocolate bars in each box:\nLisa: 7/2 * x = 7x/2\nPeter: 9/2 * x = 9x/2\n\n3. Add the number of chocolate bars each person sold:\n(7x/2) + (9x/2) = 16x/2 = 8x\n\n4. Set the sum of the chocolate bars sold equal to the total number of chocolate bars sold:\n8x = 64\n\n5. Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for x:\nx = 8\n\n**I hope it is correct: 8 chocolate bars.**",
