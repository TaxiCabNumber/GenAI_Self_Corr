At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBob is in charge of doing laundry for a large hotel. Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many pieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms?",
        "inference": "1. There are 2 sheets per room, so for 80 rooms, there are 80 * 2 = 160 sheets.\n\n2. There is one comforter per room, so for 80 rooms, there are 80 comforters.\n\n3. There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so for 80 rooms, there are 80 * 2 * 2 = 320 pillow cases.\n\n4. There are twice as many towels as pillow cases, so for 80 rooms, there are 80 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 640 towels.\n\n5. To find the total number of pieces of laundry, we add the number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels: 160 + 80 + 320 + 640 = 1200 pieces.\nI hope it is correct: 1200",
