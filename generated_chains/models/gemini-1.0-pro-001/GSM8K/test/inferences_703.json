At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLarry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?",
        "inference": "1. Each female ate 3 dumplings.\n2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.\n3. There were 8 males and 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten is (8 x 4) + (6 x 3) = 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.\nI hope it is correct: 50",
        "ground_truth": "So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.\nHence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.\nThe 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.\nSo, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.\n#### 50"
