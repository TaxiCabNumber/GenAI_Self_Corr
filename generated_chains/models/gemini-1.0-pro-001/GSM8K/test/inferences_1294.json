At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake is shopping at a clothing store. The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?",
        "inference": "First, we must calculate the total cost of the T-shirts. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts at $8 each, the total cost is 2 * $8 = $16. However, since he gets one T-shirt 50% off, we need to subtract 50% of the cost of one T-shirt, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4. So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $16 - $4 = $12.\n\nNext, we must calculate the cost of the shoes. Since the shoes are 40% off the original price of $40, we need to subtract 40% of $40 from $40. 40% of $40 is $40 * 0.4 = $16. So, the cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.\n\nFinally, we need to add the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes to get the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. $12 + $24 = $36.\nI hope it is correct: $36",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4\nThe total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12\nThe amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16\nThe cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24\nThe total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36\n#### 36"
