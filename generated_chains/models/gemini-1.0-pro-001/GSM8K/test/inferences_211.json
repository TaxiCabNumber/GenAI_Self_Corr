At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?",
        "inference": "1) Let x be the number of red chickens.\n2) The number of white chickens is then x + 2.\n3) The total number of eggs produced per day is 3x + 5(x + 2) = 8x + 10.\n4) Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we have 8x + 10 = 42.\n5) Solving for x, we get x = 4.\nI hope it is correct: Number of red chickens = 4",
        "ground_truth": "First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.\nThen, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2\nNow substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\nNow multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42\nNow add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42\nNow subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32\nFinally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4\n#### 4"
