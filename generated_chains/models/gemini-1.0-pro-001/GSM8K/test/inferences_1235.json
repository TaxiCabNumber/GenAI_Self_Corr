If he goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he covered?",

Divide the distance Michael has covered by the total distance between Alaska and Texas:\n   3600km / 6000km * 100 = 60%\n\nI hope it is correct: Percentage Covered = 60%",
