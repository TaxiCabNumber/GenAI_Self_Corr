At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAlthough Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: We need to find the total number of miles Soledad plans to cover during her vacation period. We can do this by multiplying the number of days in June (30) by the number of miles she plans to cover each time she hikes (125).\n```\nTotal miles planned = 30 days \u00d7 125 miles/day = 3,750 miles\n```\n\n**Step 2**: We need to find out how many miles per day she needs to cover to complete her journey within June. We can do this by dividing the total number of miles she needs to cover (9,300 miles) by the number of days in June: \n```\nRequired miles per day = 9,300 miles \u00f7 30 days = 310 miles/day\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Finally, we need to find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey on time. We can do this by subtracting the number of miles she plans to cover each day (125) from the required number of miles per day:\n```\nAdditional miles per day needed = 310 miles/day - 125 miles/day = 185 miles/day\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: 185",
        "ground_truth": "June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day\nInitially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day\nTo complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day\n#### 60"
