At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTim wanted to make lemonade for a pool party.  For a gallon of lemonade, his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  He found that 6 lemons would yield 1 cup of juice.  He figured he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.  His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?",
        "inference": "1. He needs 1 cup of lemon juice for each gallon of lemonade.\n\n2. 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.\n\n3. So, for 4 gallons of lemonade, he needs 4 * 1 = 4 cups of juice.\n\n4. For 5 gallons of lemonade, he needs 5 * 1 = 5 cups of juice.\n\n5. He needs 6 lemons for 1 cup of juice.\n\n6. So, for 4 cups of juice, he needs 4 * 6 = 24 lemons.\n\n7. And for 5 cups of juice, he needs 5 * 6 = 30 lemons.\n\n8. Therefore, Tim needs 24 + 30 = 54 lemons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 54",
        "ground_truth": "Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch\nIn addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total\nAll total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice\nEach cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed\n#### 36"
