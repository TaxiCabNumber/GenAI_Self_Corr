At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours, how much will they pay for their rentals, altogether?",
