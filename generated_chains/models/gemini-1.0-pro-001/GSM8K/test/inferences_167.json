At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?",
        "inference": "1. Let Brooke's age be 'b'.\n2. Seth's age is twice that of Brooke, so Seth's age is '2b'.\n3. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be 'b + 2' and Seth's age will be '2b + 2'.\n4. The sum of their ages in 2 years is 28. So, 'b + 2 + 2b + 2 = 28'.\n5. Combining like terms, we get '3b + 4 = 28'.\n6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get '3b = 24'.\n7. Dividing both sides by 3, we get 'b = 8'.\n8. Therefore, Brooke's age is '8'.\n9. Seth's age is twice that of Brooke, so Seth's age is '2b'.\n10. Substituting 'b = 8', we get Seth's age as '2 x 8 = 16'.\nI hope it is correct: 16",
