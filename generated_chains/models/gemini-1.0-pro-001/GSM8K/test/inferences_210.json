At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?",
