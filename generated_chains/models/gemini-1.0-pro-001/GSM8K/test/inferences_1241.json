At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?",
        "inference": "1) First, we need to find the total number of eggs Rose bought. One dozen is 12 eggs, so 5 dozens is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.\n2) Next, we need to find the total amount of money Rose paid for the eggs. She bought 60 eggs at $2.40 per dozen, so she paid 60 / 12 * 2.40 = $12.\n3) Now, we need to find the total amount of money Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, so she will earn 60 / 3 * 1 = $20.\n4) Finally, we can find Rose's profit by subtracting the amount she paid for the eggs from the amount she will earn by selling the eggs. So, her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.\nI hope it is correct: $8$",
        "ground_truth": "Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.\nFive dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.\nSo there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.\nThus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.\nTherefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.\n#### 8"
