At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWhile walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings, Greg found $20. To be fair to his siblings, he decided to split the money equally. How much money did each of them get?",
        "inference": "1. The total amount of money to be split is $20.\n2. Greg has 3 younger siblings, so there are 4 people to split the money among.\n3. To split the money equally, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people.\n4. $20 \u00f7 4 = $5\n5. Therefore, each person gets $5.\n\nI hope it is correct: Each of Greg's siblings gets $5",
        "ground_truth": "Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.\nThe 20 dollars were divided equally, so each of them received $20 / 4 people = <<20/4=5>>5 dollars/person\n#### 5"
