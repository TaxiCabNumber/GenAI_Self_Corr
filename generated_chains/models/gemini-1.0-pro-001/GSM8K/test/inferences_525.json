At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nHeather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?",
        "inference": "- Divide the number of cups of raisins in the bag by 3 to find how many cups of raisins each batch of cookies, granola, and snack mix will have. This is 27 cups \u00f7 3 = 9 cups.\n\n- Divide the number of cups of raisins each batch of oatmeal cookies takes by the number of cups of raisins each batch of cookies, granola, and snack mix will have. This is 3/4 cup \u00f7 9 cups = 1/12.\n\n- This means that Heather can make 1/12 of a batch of oatmeal cookies with each batch of cookies, granola, and snack mix.\n\n- To find how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, multiply the total number of batches of cookies, granola, and snack mix by 1/12. This is 3 batches \u00d7 1/12 = 1/4 batch.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1/4 batch",
        "ground_truth": "Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.\nThus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.\n#### 12"
