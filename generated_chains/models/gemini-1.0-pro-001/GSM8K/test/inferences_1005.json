Multiply the number of female porcupines by the number of babies each female gives birth to each month.\n30 * 4 = 120\n3. Multiply the number of babies born each month by the number of months in a year.\n120 * 12 = 1440\n4. Add the number of porcupines in the park at the beginning of the year to the number of babies born during the year.\n50 + 1440 = 1490\nI hope it is correct: 1490",
