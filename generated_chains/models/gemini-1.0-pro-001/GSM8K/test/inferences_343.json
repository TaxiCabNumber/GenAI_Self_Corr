At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn his training as a professional athlete, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day. If he took the coach's advice and trained for a month, what is the total distance he covered in June?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find out how many meters Tyson runs in a month. Since he runs 5000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, he runs a total of 5000 * 30 = 150000 meters in June.\n\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many meters more he runs in a day if he takes the coach's advice. The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, so he will run 5000 + (1/5)*5000 = 6000 meters in a day.\n\n\n3. Finally, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a month if he takes the coach's advice. Since he runs 6000 meters every day, and there are 30 days in June, he runs a total of 6000 * 30 = 180000 meters in June.\n\n\nI hope it is correct: 180000",
        "ground_truth": "Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.\nWhen he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.\nHe covered 6000 meters/day * 30 days/month =<<6000*30=180000>>180000 meters in June on his training sessions.\n#### 180000"
