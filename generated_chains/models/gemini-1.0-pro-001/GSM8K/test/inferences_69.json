Then she receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, how much money did Bailey start with?",

Since she has a total of $100 at the end of the 8 weeks, we can write the equation x + 40 = 100.  Solving for x, we get x = 100 - 40 = $60.\nI hope it is correct: $60$",
