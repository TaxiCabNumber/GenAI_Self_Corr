At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nZoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the total distance Zoey spit her seeds:\n\n```\n40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet\n```\n\nThen, we need to find the total distance Sydney spit her seeds:\n\n```\n35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet\n```\n\nNext, we need to add the total distances together:\n\n```\n400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet\n```\n\nFinally, we need to divide the total distance by the total number of seeds:\n\n```\n820 feet / (40 seeds + 35 seeds) = 10.25 feet/seed\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: 10.25",
        "ground_truth": "Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400\nSydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420\nThis totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820\nThe average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410\n#### 410"
