At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has 27 cups, and she divides these into 3 rows. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?",
        "inference": "1. Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows. So, each row has 27/3 = 9 cups.\n\n2. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. So, each row has 9/2 = 4.5 cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea.\n\n3. She then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. So, she has 27 - 9*3 = 0 cups of tea left to brew cinnamon tea.\n\n4. Therefore, each row has 4.5 cups of mint tea.\n\nI hope it is correct: 4.5",
