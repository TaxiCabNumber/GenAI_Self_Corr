At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.",

Determine the amount of sour milk returned: 2/5 of 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons\n\n3. Calculate the cost of the sour milk returned: 1600 gallons x $3.5 per gallon = $5,600\n\n4. Therefore, the refund amount is: $5,600\n\n**I hope it is correct: $5,600**",
        "ground_truth": "If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.\nIf each gallon costs $3.5, and he returned 1600 gallons for refund, the total amount he got from the refund is $3.5/gallon * 1600 gallons = $<<3.5*1600=5600>>5600\n#### 5600"
