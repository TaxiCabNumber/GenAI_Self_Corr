At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?",
        "inference": "**Given:**\n- Number of reservations per night: 6\n- Cost of each meal: $5\n- Number of meals ordered per reservation: 2\n- Cost of wine per bottle: $5\n- Number of days open per week: 2\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of food for one night:\n   - Number of meals: 6 x 2 = 12\n   - Cost of meals: 12 x $5 = $60\n   - Cost of wine: $5\n\n2. Calculate the total cost of food and wine for one night:\n   - Cost of food: $60\n   - Cost of wine: $5\n   - Total cost: $60 + $5 = $65\n\n3. Calculate the total revenue for one night:\n   - Total cost: $65\n   - Revenue per night: 6 x $65 = $390\n\n4. Calculate the total revenue for one week:\n   - Number of days open per week: 2\n   - Revenue per night: $390\n   - Total revenue: 2 x $390 = $780\n\nI hope it is correct: 780",
        "ground_truth": "The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table\nSo each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night\nSo they make 6*$15=$<<6*15=90>>90 a night\nThat means they make $90*2=$<<90*2=180>>180 a week\n#### 180"
