At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 20 feet to inches.\n2. Find the difference between 600 inches and the current height.\n3. Divide the difference by the daily growth rate to find the number of days.\n\n1. 20 feet = 240 inches\n2. 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches\n3. 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days\n\nI hope that is correct: 12 days.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nSo, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.\nTherefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.\n#### 12"
