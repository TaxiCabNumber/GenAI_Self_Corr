At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nShannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon\u2019s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?",
