        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAs Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, which she carried into the school.  What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n- Sally started with 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst, so she lost 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons.\n- She then had 15 red balloons left.\n- She had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them, so she lost 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons.\n- She then had 6 yellow balloons left.\n- She found 8 blue balloons, and she added 75% of them to her remaining balloons, so she added 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.\n- She then had 6 blue balloons.\n- She had 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons, for a total of 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons.\n\nI hope it is correct: 27",
        "ground_truth": "Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.\nBut 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.\nThe loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.\nShe added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.\nThus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons\n#### 34"
