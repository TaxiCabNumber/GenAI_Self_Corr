At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTo heat during the winter, Ali ordered 850 kilos of coal. The coal is delivered in 50 kg bags, costing $18 per unit. How much does his order cost?",

Now, let's find the total cost of Ali's order by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:\n$$17*18=306$$\n\nI hope it is correct: $306",
