At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMitchell is making nachos for his family. He buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each. If his family has five members, how many chips does each person get if they all get the same number?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total number of chips: 55 chips/bag * 2 bags = 110 chips\n\n2. Divide the total number of chips by the number of family members: 110 chips / 5 members = 22 chips/person\n\nI hope it is correct: 22 chips/person",
        "ground_truth": "There are 110 chips because 2 x 55 = <<2*55=110>>110\nThey each get 22 chips because 110 / 5 = <<110/5=22>>22\n#### 22"
