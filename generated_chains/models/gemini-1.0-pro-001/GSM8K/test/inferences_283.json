At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nKaterina makes designer jewelry.  Her specialty is topaz necklaces.  She uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and fills the space between gemstones using sterling silver beads.  If each topaz gemstone is one inch long, each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long, and each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches, how many sterling silver beads does Katerina use per necklace?",
        "inference": "* One topaz is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones, so $8\\cdot1=8$ inches long.\n* The remaining length of the necklace is $25-8=17$ inches.\n* Each sterling silver bead is $1/4$ inch long, so the number of beads is $17/0.25=\\boxed{68}$\n   I hope it is correct: 68",
        "ground_truth": "8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.\nSince each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.\nSince Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.\n#### 68"
