At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?",
        "inference": "1. Let x equal the number of players on the defense.\n2. The number of players on the offense is 2x.\n3. The number of players on the special teams is x/2.\n4. Since there are 105 players total, we can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: (5x/2) = 105.\n6. Solving for x, we get: x = 105 * 2 / 5 = 42.\nI hope it is correct: 42",
        "ground_truth": "Let x represent the number of players on the defense\nOffense:2x\nSpecial Teams:(1/2)x\nTotal:x+2x+(1/2)x=105\n(7/2)x=105\nx=105(2/7)=30 players\n#### 30"
