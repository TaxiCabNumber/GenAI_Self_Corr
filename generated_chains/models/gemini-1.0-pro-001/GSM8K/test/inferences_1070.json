At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants that he makes.  He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.  The grocery store currently has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off.  If the butter costs $4.00 a pound, how much will it cost him to purchase 6 pounds of butter?",

Since Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he needs 6 pounds of butter for 6 dozen croissants.\n\n3. The grocery store promotion offers buy one pound of butter get one half off. So, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays for 1 pound.\n\n4. To determine the total cost of 6 pounds of butter, we divide the total number of pounds (6) by the number of pounds he pays for (2) and multiply by the cost of 1 pound of butter ($4.00).\n\nTotal cost = (6 pounds / 2 pounds) * $4.00 = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00\nI hope it is correct: $12.00$",
