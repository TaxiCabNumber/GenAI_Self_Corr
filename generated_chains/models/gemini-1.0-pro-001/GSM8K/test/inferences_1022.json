At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTeresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?",
