At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA merchant wants to make a choice of purchase between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will go up 2.5% while the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2% within the same month. If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?",
        "inference": "Jewelry at the end of a month: 5,000 * (100% +2.5%) = 5,000 * 102.5% = $5,125\nElectronic gadgets at the end of the month: 8,000 * (100% + 1.2%) = 8,000 * 101.2% = $8,125\n\nProfit on jewelry = 5,125 - 5,000 = $125\nProfit on electronic gadgets = 8,125 - 8,000 = $125\n\nSince the profits are the same for both choices, it doesn't matter which one the merchant chooses.\n\nI hope it is correct: $125$",
        "ground_truth": "If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125\nIf he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96\nIf he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125\n#### 125"
