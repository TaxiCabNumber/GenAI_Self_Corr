At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find the total number of legs for the spiders. We can do this by multiplying the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has: 80 * 8 = 640 legs.\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of legs for the insects. We can do this by multiplying the number of insects by the number of legs each insect has: 90 * 6 = 540 legs.\n3. Finally, we need to find the total number of legs for the mutant invertebrates. We can do this by multiplying the number of invertebrates by the number of legs each invertebrate has: 3 * 10 = 30 legs.\n4. To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs for the spiders, the insects, and the mutant invertebrates: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.\n\nI hope it is correct: 1210",
