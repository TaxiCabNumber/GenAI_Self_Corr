At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?",
        "inference": "1. Cameron wants to stay for 17 hours because he arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave the next day at 10 am.\n2. If he pays for 24 hours, he would pay 1600 pesos.\n3. If he pays for 12 hours and adds on 70 pesos for 5 extra hours, he would pay 1000 pesos + 70 pesos x 5 hours = 1350 pesos.\n4. By choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours, Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.\nI hope it is correct: 250",
        "ground_truth": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250"
