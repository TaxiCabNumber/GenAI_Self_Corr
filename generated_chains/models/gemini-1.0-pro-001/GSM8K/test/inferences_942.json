At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPatty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house to make a repair, plus $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, plus parts. One job took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts. How much did Patty charge?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the charge for the visit: $40.00\n2. Calculate the charge for the labor: 2.25 hours x $35.00/hour = $78.75\n3. Add the charges: $40.00 + $78.75 + $60.00 = $178.75\nI hope it is correct: $178.75",
        "ground_truth": "She charged for 3 hours.\nThe total cost from the hourly rate was 3*35=$<<3*35=105>>105.\nShe charged 40+105+60=<<40+105+60=205>>205.\n#### 205"
