At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIn a candy machine, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. If there are 12 blue gumballs how many pink ones are there?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assume the number of blue gumballs is x.\n2. According to the given information, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. So, the number of pink gumballs can be expressed as 4x + 22.\n3. We know that the number of blue gumballs is 12, so we can substitute x = 12 in the equation for the number of pink gumballs.\n4. 4x + 22 = 4(12) + 22 = 48 + 22 = 70.\n5. Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.\n\nI hope it is correct: 70",
