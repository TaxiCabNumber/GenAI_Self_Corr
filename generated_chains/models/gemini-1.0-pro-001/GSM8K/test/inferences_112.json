At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA classroom has a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?",
        "inference": "4 teachers * 2 lessons per day = 8 daily lessons\n8 daily lessons * 3 whiteboard cleanings per lesson = 24 whiteboard cleanings per day\nI hope it is correct: 24",
