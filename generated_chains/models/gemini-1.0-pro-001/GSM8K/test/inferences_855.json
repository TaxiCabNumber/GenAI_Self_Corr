At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nI am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?",
