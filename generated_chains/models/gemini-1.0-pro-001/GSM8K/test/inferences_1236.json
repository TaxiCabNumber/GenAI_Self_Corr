At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMadeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?",

The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies so we need to figure out how many grapes she used\n4. Each pie calls for 12 grapes, so she used (12*4 = 48) grapes\n5. To find the total number of grapes, we add the number of grapes Madeline ate, the number of grapes the brother used, and the number of grapes the mother used (6+30+48 = 84)\n\nI hope it is correct: 84",
