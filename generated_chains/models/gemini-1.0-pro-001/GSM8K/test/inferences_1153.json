At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach playing and they decided to gather some seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally between themselves.
