At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nRory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Let's assume the number of balls retrieved in the second set is x.**\n\n**Step 2: According to the information given, Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.**\n\n**Step 3: In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. So, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.**\n\n**Step 4: We know that Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls. So, we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19.**\n\n**Step 5: Simplifying the equation: 2.5x + 4 = 19.**\n\n**Step 6: Subtracting 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15.**\n\n**Step 7: Dividing both sides by 2.5: x = 6.**\n\n**Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set.**\n\n**Going back to Step 2, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.**\n\n**I hope it is correct: 10$",
        "ground_truth": "Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.\nIn the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.\nIn the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.\nIn total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.\nThus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.\nTherefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.\nHence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.\nIn the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10\n#### 10"
