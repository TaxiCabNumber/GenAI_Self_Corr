At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMark decides to buy packs of old magic cards and open them to sell.  He buys 3 packs for $1800 each.  He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  How much money profit did he make?",

Calculate the sum of money Mark got from selling the 2 expensive cards: \n$4,000 + $1,000 = $5,000\n\n3. Calculate the sum of money Mark got from selling the 30 other cards: \n30 * $50 = $1,500\n\n4.
