The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?",

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, which means half of the students are boys and the other half are girls.\n\n3. So, there are 30 boys in the school.\n\n4. The first class has 15 girls, which means there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class.\n\n5. The second class has 12 girls, which means there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class.\n\n6. So, the total number of boys in the first and second classes is 5 + 8 = 13.\n\n7. Since there are 30 boys in the school and 13 boys in the first and second classes, there are 30 - 13 = 17 boys in the third class.\n\nI hope it is correct: 17",
