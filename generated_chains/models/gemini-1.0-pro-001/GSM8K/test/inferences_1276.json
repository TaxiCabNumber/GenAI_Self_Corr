At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJames wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?",

Subtract the length of the gate.\nLength of streamers needed = Perimeter - length of gate\nLength of streamers needed = 70 feet - 0 feet\nLength of streamers needed = 70 feet\n\nI hope it is correct: 70 feet",
        "ground_truth": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70"
