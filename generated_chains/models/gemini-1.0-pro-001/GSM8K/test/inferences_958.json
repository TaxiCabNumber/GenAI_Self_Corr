At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCourtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?",
        "inference": "We need to calculate the number of people who actually attended the concert based on Kelly's information. She said that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, which means the actual number is 80% of what Courtney reported. So, we can use the following steps to find the actual number of attendees:\n1. Calculate 80% of 48: 0.80 x 48 = 38.4\n2. Round the result to the nearest whole number: 38\nI hope it is correct: the number of people who attended the concert is 38",
        "ground_truth": "Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number\nTherefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40\n#### 40"
