At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nDale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?",
        "inference": "**1. Subtract the original amount of candy from the amount he sold.**\n150 - 100 = 50\n\n**2. Add the amount of candy he ordered after selling.**\n50 + 100 = 150\n\n**3. This is the number of candies Dale still needs to sell.**\n**I hope it is correct: 150**",
        "ground_truth": "Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.\nSo Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.\n#### 50"
