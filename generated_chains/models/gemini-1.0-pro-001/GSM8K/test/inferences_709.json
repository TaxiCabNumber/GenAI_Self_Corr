At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAn ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?",
        "inference": "Firstly, let's calculate the hourly production of each flavor.\n\nChocolate ice cream: $\\frac{100 \\text{ quarts}}{2 \\text{ hours}} = 50 \\text{ quarts/hour}$\n\nVanilla ice cream: $\\frac{50 \\text{ quarts}}{4 \\text{ hours}} = 12.5 \\text{ quarts/hour}$\n\nNow we can find the total hourly production by adding the hourly production of both flavors:\n\nTotal hourly production: $50 \\text{ quarts/hour} + 12.5 \\text{ quarts/hour} = 62.5 \\text{ quarts/hour}$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total production in 48 hours by multiplying the total hourly production by the number of hours:\n\nTotal production in 48 hours: $62.5 \\text{ quarts/hour} \\times 48 \\text{ hours} = 3000 \\text{ quarts}$\n\nI hope it is correct: 3000",
        "ground_truth": "Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.\nVanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\nCombined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.\n#### 3000"
