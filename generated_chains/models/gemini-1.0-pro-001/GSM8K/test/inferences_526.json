She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?",

After she adds the new device, her daily electric consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. So, her daily electric bill after adding the new device will be 14 * 1.50 = $21.\n\n3.
