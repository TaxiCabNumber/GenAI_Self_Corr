At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to do the run?",

        "ground_truth": "Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes\nSo his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes\nJames finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster\nSo he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes\nHe finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes\nJames' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180\nSo it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run\n#### 59"
