At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMatt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?",
        "inference": "1. Let x be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.\n2. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies Matt can have is (x/2) + 2.\n3. We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we can set up the equation (x/2) + 2 = 5.\n4. Solving for x, we get x = 6.\nTherefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get five cookies.\n\nI hope it is correct: 6",
        "ground_truth": "First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3\nThen double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.\n#### 6"
