He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",

The percentage increase in value is $50,000 / $80,000 * 100% = 150%.\n4. The profit is $130,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $10,000.\nI hope it is correct: $10,000$",
