At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nZaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?",
