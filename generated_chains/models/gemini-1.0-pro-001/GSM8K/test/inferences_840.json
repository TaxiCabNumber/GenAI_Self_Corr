At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nPatrick has three glue sticks that are partially used. One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left and the third one has 1/2 left. If a glue stick is 12 millimeters long originally, what is the total length of the glue sticks that are not used?",
        "inference": "**Solution**:\nPatrick's first glue stick has 5/6 used. We can calculate the amount of length used:\n\n```\n5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm\n```\n\nSo the length remaining in the first glue stick is:\n\n```\n12 mm - 10 mm = 2 mm\n```\n\nPatrick's second glue stick has 1/3 used. We can calculate the amount of length used:\n\n```\n1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm\n```\n\nSo the length remaining in the second glue stick is:\n\n```\n12 mm - 4 mm = 8 mm\n```\n\nPatrick's third glue stick has 1/2 used. We can calculate the amount of length used:\n\n```\n1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm\n```\n\nSo the length remaining in the third glue stick is:\n\n```\n12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm\n```\n\nTo find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we add up the lengths remaining in each glue stick:\n\n```\n2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm\n```\n\nI hope it is correct: $16$",
