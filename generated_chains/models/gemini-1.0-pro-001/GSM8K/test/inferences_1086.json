At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMarcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:\n300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes\n\n2. Calculate the number of BMX bikes sold:\n300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes\n\n3. Calculate the number of MTB bikes sold:\n300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes\n\n4. Calculate the total earnings from selling Trekking bikes:\n150 * $450 = $67,500\n\n5. Calculate the total earnings from selling BMX bikes:\n45 * ($500 / 2) = $11,250\n\n6. Calculate the total earnings from selling MTB bikes:\n105 * $500 = $52,500\n\n7. Add up the earnings from all types of bikes:\n$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250\n\nI hope it is correct: $131,250$",
