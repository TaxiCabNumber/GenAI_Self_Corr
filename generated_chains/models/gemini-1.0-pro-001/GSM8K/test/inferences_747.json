At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets a new vendor who sells them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?",

Calculate the amount of money the vendor spends on tomatoes per week: $250 per day x 7 days = $1,750 per week\n3. Calculate the amount of money the vendor saves per tomato: $.5 per tomato - $.4 per tomato = $.1 per tomato\n4. Calculate the amount of money the vendor saves per week: $.1 per tomato x 500 tomatoes per day x 7 days = $35 per week\nI hope it is correct: $35",
