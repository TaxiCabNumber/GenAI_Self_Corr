If there were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given ten burritos, with Mr. George eating 20 of them, calculate the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic?",

Subtract the burritos consumed by the students from the total number of burritos ordered:\n600 burritos - 500 burritos = 100 burritos\n\n3. Subtract the burritos consumed by Mr. George:\n100 burritos - 20 burritos = 80 burritos\n\nI hope it is correct: 80",
