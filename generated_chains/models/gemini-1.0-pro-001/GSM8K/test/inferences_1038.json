        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Jim had a job before college that paid $25k a year.\n2. He went to college for 4 years and took out $50k in loans each year, for a total of $200k in loans.\n3. His college degree tripled his income, so after college he earned $75k per year.\n4. The amount of money he lost from not working while in school is $25k per year * 4 years = $100k.\n5. The total amount of money he owes is $200k (loans) + $100k (lost income) = $300k.\n6. He earns $75k per year after college.\n7. To earn the $300k, he will need to work for $300k / $75k = 4 years.\n\n**I hope it is correct: 4 years**",
        "ground_truth": "His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year\nSo he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year\nHis loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000\nHe lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working\nSo he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000\nThat means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years\n#### 4"
