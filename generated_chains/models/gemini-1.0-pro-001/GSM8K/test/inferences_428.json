While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half of the guests to be able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?",

So, a total of 18 * 2 = 36 hotdogs would have been needed for the expected 36 guests.\n\nHowever, 40 guests showed up, so the caterer was short 4 hotdogs (40 - 36 = 4).\n\nSince everyone wanted a second hotdog, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.\nI hope it is correct: 4",
