        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?",
        "inference": "He would need to sell 15 cars\nFor every two cars sold, he needs 2 customers to come into the dealership\nSo, for 15 cars, he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers\nFor every 25 phone calls, he gets 1 customer\nSo, for 30 customers, he needs 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls\nI hope it is correct: 750",
        "ground_truth": "If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.\nSince Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.\n#### 750"
