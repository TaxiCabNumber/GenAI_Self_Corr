At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?",
