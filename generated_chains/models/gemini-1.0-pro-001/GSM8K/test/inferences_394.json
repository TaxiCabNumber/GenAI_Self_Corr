At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nWendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. How many books will she need to carry to complete her task?",
        "inference": "1. We know that Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system. We don't know the number of books Wendy wants to place, but we can represent it as \"b\".\n2. We are told that the system has 6 rows and 6 columns. This means that the total number of spaces is 6 * 6 = 36.\n3. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, so we can write an equation:\n```\nb = 2 * b + 20\n```\n4. We can solve for \"b\" by subtracting \"b\" from both sides:\n```\nb - 2 * b = 20\n```\n```\n-b = 20\n```\n```\nb = -20\n```\n5. The number of books cannot be negative, so something is wrong. We made a mistake in our equation. Let's go back and check our work.\n6. We made a mistake in step 3. We should have written the equation as:\n```\nb = 2 * b + 20\n```\n7. Subtracting \"2 * b\" from both sides, we get:\n```\nb - 2 * b = -20\n```\n```\n-b = -20\n```\n```\nb = 20\n```\n8. Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 20 books to complete her task.\nI hope it is correct: 20",
