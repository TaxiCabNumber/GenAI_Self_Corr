At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast year there were 50 students enrolled in a calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. How many students are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class?",
