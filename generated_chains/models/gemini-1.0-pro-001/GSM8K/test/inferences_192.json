At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTom plants 10 trees a year.  Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years 30% of the trees die.  How many trees does he have left?",
        "inference": "Tom begins with 50 trees and plants 10 trees a year, so in 10 years, he will have planted 100 trees ($50 + 10 * 10 = 150$). He also chops down two trees each year, so he will have chopped down 20 trees in 10 years ($2 * 10 = 20$). Thus, he will have a total of 130 trees ($150 - 20 = 130$) after 10 years.\n\n30% of the trees die, which means 30% of 130 trees will die ($0.30 * 130 = 39$).
