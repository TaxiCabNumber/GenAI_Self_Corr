She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?",

Helen took the bus 7 times, so the total cost of bus travel is 7 * $8 = $56.\n3. Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $80 = $240.\n4. The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is $240 + $56 = $296.\nI hope it is correct: $296",
