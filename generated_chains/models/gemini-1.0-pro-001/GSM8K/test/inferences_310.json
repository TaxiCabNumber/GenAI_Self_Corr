At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTheo has $6000 he wishes to spend on his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit.
