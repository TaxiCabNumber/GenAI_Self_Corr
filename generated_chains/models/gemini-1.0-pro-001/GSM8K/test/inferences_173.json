At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?",

Add the additional payments to the minimum payments to get the total monthly payment for each debt:\n- Student loans: $300 + $150 = $450\n- Credit card: $200 + $100 = $300\n- Mortgage: $500 + $250 = $750\n\n3. Multiply the total monthly payment for each debt by 12 to get the annual payment:\n- Student loans: $450 x 12 = $5,400\n- Credit card: $300 x 12 = $3,600\n- Mortgage: $750 x 12 = $9,000\n\n4. Add the annual payments for all three debts to get the total annual payment:\n- $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000\n\nI hope it is correct: $18000$",
