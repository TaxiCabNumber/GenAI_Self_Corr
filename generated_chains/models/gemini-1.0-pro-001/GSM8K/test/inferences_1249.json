There are 8 rooms in the house and 4 people living there, including Brianna. There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room. They have a variety of candles available; 4 small candles each for half the rooms and 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?",
