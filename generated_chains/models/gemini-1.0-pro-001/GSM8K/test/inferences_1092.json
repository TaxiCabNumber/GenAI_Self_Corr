At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?",
        "inference": "1. The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat.\n2. The Velociraptors ate half of what was left, so they ate 270 / 2 = 135 kilograms of meat.\n3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so it ate 270 + 135 = 405 kilograms of meat.\n4. The triceratops had 405 x 2 = 810 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.\n\nI hope it is correct: 810",
        "ground_truth": "The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.\nThe T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.\n#### 1080"
