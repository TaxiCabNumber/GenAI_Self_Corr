        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThe Hortex company produces bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. How many more bottles of juices would Hortex have to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people:\n2300 people * 100% = 230000%\n\n2. Calculate the total amount of energy that Hortex can cover with its current production:\n4200 bottles * 20% = 84000%\n\n3. Calculate the difference between the total demand and the amount that Hortex can cover:\n230000% - 84000% = 146000%\n\n4. Calculate the number of additional bottles that Hortex needs to produce to cover the remaining demand:\n146000% / 20% = 7300 bottles\n\nI hope it is correct: 7300 $bottles$",
        "ground_truth": "Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.\nSo 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.\nTo cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.\n#### 7300"
