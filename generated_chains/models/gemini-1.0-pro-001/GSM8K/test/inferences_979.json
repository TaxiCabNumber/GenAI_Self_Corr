When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.  What is the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now?",
        "inference": "It is given that Emil is 19 years old now, and when he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. So, Emil's age when he is 24 is half the age of his dad now thus  = 19 + 5 = 24. This implies his dad is 24 * 2 = 48 years old now. Also, when Emil turns 24, his age will be twice that of his brother, so his brother is (24 / 2) - 5 = 7 years old now. Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 48 + 7 = 55\nI hope it is correct: 55",
