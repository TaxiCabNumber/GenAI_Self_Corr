At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nTogether Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number that David found x.\nAccording to the problem, we have the following information:\n1. Lily found 7 more than David. So, Lily found x + 7 insects.\n2. David found half of what Bodhi found. So, Bodhi found 2x insects.\n3. Together, they found 43 insects. So, x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43.\n4. Solving the equation, we get: 4x + 7 = 43.\n5. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get: 4x = 36.\n6. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 9.\n7. Therefore, David found 9 insects.\n8. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.\nI hope it is correct: 16",
