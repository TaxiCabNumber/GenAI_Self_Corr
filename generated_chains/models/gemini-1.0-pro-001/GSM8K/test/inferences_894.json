At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLast month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Let's assume the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week is x.**\n\n**Step 2: According to the given information, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn in the first week is 3x.**\n\n**Step 3: In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. So, the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn in the second week is 5x.**\n\n**Step 4: Tasha made $80 in total, and she received $6 for mowing Joe's lawn. So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $80 - $6 = $74.**\n\nI hope it is correct: $74",
        "ground_truth": "At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars\nSince the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.\nAdding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars\nSubtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars\nTasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.\n#### 26"
