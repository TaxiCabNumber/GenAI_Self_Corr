So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (4/12)*100 = 33.3%.\n- To find the percentage of all the puppies with spots, we need to find the weighted average of the percentages for each dog. \n- The weights are the number of puppies in each litter. \n- So, the percentage of all the puppies with spots is ((3/8)*100*8 + (4/12)*100*12)/(8 + 12) = 35.0%.\nI hope it is correct: 35%",
