At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nOn Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. How many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?",
