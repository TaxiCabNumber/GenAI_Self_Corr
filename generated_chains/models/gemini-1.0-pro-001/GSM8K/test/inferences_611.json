At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nJohn decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?",
