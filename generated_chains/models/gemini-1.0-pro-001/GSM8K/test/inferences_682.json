        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nShania is designing her own dress, and decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the original length of the dress is x (in centimeters).\n\n**Step 1: Increase by 50%**\n\nWhen Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length becomes x + 0.5x = 1.5x.\n\n**Step 2: Add lace trim**\n\nShe further adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress, giving us a new length of 1.5x + 20.\n\n**Step 3: Equate to final length**\n\nWe know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.5x + 20 = 140\n\n**Step 4: Solve for x**\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n1.5x = 140 - 20\n1.5x = 120\nx = 120 / 1.5\nx = 80 cm\n\n**Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.**\nI hope it is correct: 80 cm",
