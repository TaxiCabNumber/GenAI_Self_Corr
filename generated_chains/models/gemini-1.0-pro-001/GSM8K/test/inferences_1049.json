At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nThere are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?",
        "inference": "**1.** Half of 50 is 25, so there are 25 English books.\n**2.** 10% of 50 is 5, so there are 5 German books.\n**3.** 25 + 5 = 30, so there are 30 English and German books.\n**4.** 50 - 30 = 20, so there are 20 Spanish books.\n\nI hope it is correct: 20",
        "ground_truth": "Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.\nGerman books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.\nSo as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.\n#### 20"
