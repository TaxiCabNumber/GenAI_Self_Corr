At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA hospital sees 500 people a day.  Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?",

Calculate the total number of patient-hours per day:\n\n500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 patient-hours/day\n\n3. Determine the total amount charged by the doctors to the hospital per day:\n\n200 patient-hours/day * $150/hour = $30,000/day\n\n4. Calculate the total amount charged by the hospital to the patients per day:\n\n200 patient-hours/day * $200/hour = $40,000/day\n\n5. Compute the hospital's profit per day:\n\nProfit = (Amount charged by hospital) - (Amount charged by doctors)\nProfit = $40,000/day - $30,000/day\nProfit = $10,000/day\n\nI hope it is correct: $10,000$",
        "ground_truth": "The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day\nThat means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day\nThey profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour\nSo they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits\n#### 10000"
