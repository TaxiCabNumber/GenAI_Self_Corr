        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.**\nRevenue from truck tires = $60 x 6 = $360\nRevenue from car tires = $40 x 4 = $160\nTotal revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.**\nRevenue from car tires = $40 x 12 = $480\nRevenue from truck tires =$0\nTotal revenue on Friday = $480 + $0 = $480\n\n**Step 3: Determine the day with higher revenue.**\nFriday has higher revenue ($480) than Thursday ($520).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the difference in revenue.**\nDifference in revenue = Revenue on Friday - Revenue on Thursday\n= $480 - $520\n= -$40\n\n**I hope it is correct: $-40$**",
        "ground_truth": "On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.\nOn Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.\nThus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.\n#### 40"
