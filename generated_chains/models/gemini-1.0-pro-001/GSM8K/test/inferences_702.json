At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nGissela, Gordy, and Gary are truck drivers.  Gissela has a truck large enough to haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?",
        "inference": "1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.\n2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.\n3. The three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel, so Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 = 2,800 pounds of gravel.\n\nI hope it is correct: 2,800 pounds",
        "ground_truth": "Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.\nThus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.\n#### 2800"
