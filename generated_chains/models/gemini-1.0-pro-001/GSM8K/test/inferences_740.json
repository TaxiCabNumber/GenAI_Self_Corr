How many like to play video games if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?",

We know that the total number of students is 50, so we can write an equation: 10 + 5 + x + 2(5) = 50. \n\n3. Simplifying the equation: 10 + 5 + x + 10 = 50. \n\n4. Combining like terms: 15 + x = 50. \n\n5. Subtracting 15 from both sides: x = 50 - 15. \n\n6. Solving for x: x = 35.  \n\n**I hope it is correct: x = 35**",
