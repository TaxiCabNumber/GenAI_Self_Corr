At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLisa is part of a choir that has 52 members, 50% of which are boys and 50% of which are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  On the day of the performance, however, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. How many people sang in the performance?",
