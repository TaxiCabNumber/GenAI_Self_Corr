At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?",
        "inference": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes.\nThen the number of blueberry cubes is 5s - 4.\nThe total number of cubes is 116, so we have:\ns + (5s - 4) = 116\n6s - 4 = 116\n6s = 120\ns = 20\nSo the number of blueberry cubes is 5(20) - 4 = 96.\nI hope it is correct: 96",
        "ground_truth": "Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.\nCombining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116\nAdding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120\nDividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20\nSubstituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96\n#### 96"
