At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nIt costs $194 per meter to repave a street. Monica's street is 150 meters long. How much more does it cost to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the cost to repave Monica's street. To do this, we multiply the length of her street (150 meters) by the cost per meter ($194).\n\nCost to repave Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100\n\nNow, we need to find the cost to repave Lewis' street. To do this, we multiply the length of his street (490 meters) by the cost per meter ($194).\n\nCost to repave Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060\n\nFinally, we need to find the difference between the cost to repave Lewis' street and the cost to repave Monica's street. To do this, we subtract the cost to repave Monica's street ($29,100) from the cost to repave Lewis' street ($95,060).\n\nCost difference = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960\n\nI hope it is correct: $65,960",
