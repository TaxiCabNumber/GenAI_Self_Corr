At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSunny is selling gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?",
        "inference": "1. Let's say Sunny sold \"x\" boxes of apple pie on Saturday.\n2. Then, he sold \"x - 4\" boxes of gingerbread on Saturday.\n3. On Sunday, he sold \"x + 5\" boxes of gingerbread.\n4. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.\n5. The total cost of gingerbread sold on Saturday is (x - 4) * $6 = 6x - $24.\n6. The total cost of apple pie sold on Saturday is x * $15 = $15x.\n7. The total cost of gingerbread sold on Sunday is (x + 5) * $6 = 6x + $30.\n8. The total cost of apple pie sold on Sunday is 15 * $15 = $225.\n9. The total cost of gingerbread sold on both days is (6x - $24) + (6x + $30) = 12x + $6.\n10. The total cost of apple pie sold on both days is $15x + $225.\n11. The total amount earned is 12x + $6 + $15x + $225 = 27x + $231.\n12. I don't know the value of x, so I can't calculate the exact amount earned. However, I can say that the total amount earned is 27x + $231.\nI hope it is correct: 27x + $231",
