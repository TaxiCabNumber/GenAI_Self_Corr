They ask for 30 plant pots for the daisies, and twice as many for the roses. April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed. How many plant pots does April have left over?",

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center.\n4. So, April needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots in total.\n5. She has 100 plant pots, so she has 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over.\n\nI hope it is correct: 10 $plant pots$",
