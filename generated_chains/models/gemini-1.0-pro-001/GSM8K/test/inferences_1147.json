At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nLauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  She was hired for a big project to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.  How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?",
        "inference": "1. List the number of large scenes she can draw per day, the number of medium scenes she can draw per day, and the number of small scenes she can draw per day.\n2. Find the least common multiple of the three numbers to find the number of days it will take her to create all of the scenes.\n3. Divide the number of large scenes she needs to create by the number of large scenes she can create per day to find the number of days it will take her to create the large scenes.\n4. Divide the number of medium scenes she needs to create by the number of medium scenes she can create per day to find the number of days it will take her to create the medium scenes.\n5. Divide the number of small scenes she needs to create by the number of small scenes she can create per day to find the number of days it will take her to create the small scenes.\n6. Take the greatest of the three numbers from steps 3, 4, and 5 to find the number of days it will take her to create all of the scenes.\n\nI hope it is correct: 14 days",
