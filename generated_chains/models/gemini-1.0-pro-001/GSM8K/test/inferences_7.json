At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCarla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?",
        "inference": "1. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.\n2. Carla downloaded 80 GB at 2 GB/minute, so it took 40 minutes.\n3. Carla lost 40 minutes of progress due to the restart.\n4. Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB from the beginning.\n5. It will take Carla 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.\n6. Total download time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.\nI hope it is correct: 120 minutes",
        "ground_truth": "First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB\nThen divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes\nThen find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes\nThen add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes\n#### 160"
