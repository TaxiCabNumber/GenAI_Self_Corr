At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nA shop sells school supplies. One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10. Daniel is an engineering student, and he wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total cost of the items without the discount:\nCost of notebooks = 5 x $1.50 = $7.50\nCost of pens = 2 x $0.25 = $0.50\nCost of calculator = 1 x $12 = $12\nCost of geometry set = 1 x $10 = $10\nTotal cost without discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30\n\n2. Calculate the discount amount:\nDiscount = 10% of $30 = $3\n\n3. Calculate the total cost with the discount:\nTotal cost with discount = $30 - $3 = $27\n\nI hope it is correct: $27$",
        "ground_truth": "Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50\nTwo pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50.\nThe total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.\nThus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.\n#### 27"
