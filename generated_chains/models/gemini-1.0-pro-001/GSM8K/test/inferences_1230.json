At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nCharlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the cost of the 4 standard lessons:\n4 lessons x $80 per lesson = $320\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the 2 veteran lessons with a 25% discount:\n2 lessons x $80 per lesson x 75% = $120\n\n3. Add the cost of the standard lessons and the veteran lessons:\n$320 + $120 = $440\n\nI hope it is correct: $440",
        "ground_truth": "4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.\nReducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.\nThus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,\nThus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.\nAll together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.\n#### 440"
