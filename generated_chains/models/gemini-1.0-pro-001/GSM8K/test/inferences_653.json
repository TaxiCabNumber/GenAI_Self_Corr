At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nSally has realized she did not receive a full wage this week. Her bank account, which held $200 at the start of the week, now holds $420. She has received no other money into her bank account this week. If her weekly wage should be $300, how many dollars were withheld from Sally\u2019s wage?",

Calculate the difference between the amount of money Sally should have and the amount of money that is actually in her bank account:\n$500 (expected amount) - $420 (actual amount) = $80\n3.
