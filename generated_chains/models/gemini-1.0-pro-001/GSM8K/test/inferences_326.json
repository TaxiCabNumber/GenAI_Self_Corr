At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how many people got on the bus at the terminal?",

After the second stop, there will be (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 people on the bus.\n\n4. We know that the total number of people on the bus is 20, so we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 20.\n\n5.
