At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nAccording to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:\nTotal calories = 250 calories/serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories\n\n2. Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:\nRemaining calories = 2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories\n\n3. Determine the number of servings you can eat:\nServings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving = 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings\n\n4. Convert the number of servings to grams:\nGrams = Servings x Weight per serving = 0.8 servings x 300g/5 servings = 48g\n\nI hope it is correct: 48 g",
        "ground_truth": "If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams\nIf I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams\n#### 48"
