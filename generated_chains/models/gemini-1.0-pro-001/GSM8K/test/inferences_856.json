At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nMr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?",

Determine the number of glue sticks in each pack: 8 glue sticks/pack.\n\n3. Divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in each pack to find the number of packs needed: 54 glue sticks \u00f7 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.\n\n4. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number: 7 packs.\n\nI hope it is correct: 7",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.\nDivide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.\nMr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n#### 7"
