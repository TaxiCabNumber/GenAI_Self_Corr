At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nApple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?",
        "inference": "The total number of people attending is 6000. The number of seats for graduates and faculty is 950 + 300 = 1250. The number of seats available for guests is 6000 - 1250 = 4750. The number of graduates is not given, but we can find the number of tickets each graduate receives by dividing the number of seats available for guests by the number of graduates.\nI hope it is correct: Let $x$ be the number of graduates. Then, each graduate receives $\\frac{4750}{x}$ tickets.",
        "ground_truth": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.\nDivide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets\n#### 5"
