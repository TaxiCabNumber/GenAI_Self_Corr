At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'I hope it is correct: #### $answer$'\nBoris owns a chocolate factory. He produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?",
        "inference": "- Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week.\n- The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. So, he produces 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate the second week.\n- The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So, he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate the third week.\n- To find out how much he produces the fourth week, we can subtract the total number of bars of chocolate he produced in the first three weeks from the total number of bars of chocolate he produces each month. So, 50,000 - (8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000) = 14,000.\n\nI hope it is correct: $14,000$",
