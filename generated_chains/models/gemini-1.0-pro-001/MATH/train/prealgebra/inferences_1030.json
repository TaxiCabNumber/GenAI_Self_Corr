At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat numeral is in the 100th decimal place in the decimal representation of $\\frac{6}{7}$?",
        "inference": "$\\frac{6}{7} = 0.857142857142857142...$.\n\nThe sequence of digits in the decimal representation of $\\frac{6}{7}$ is periodic, with a period of $6$. Therefore, the numeral in the 100th decimal place is the same as the numeral in the 4th decimal place, which is $7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{6}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{857142}$, which repeats every 6 digits. Since 100 divided by 6 has a remainder of 4, the 100th digit is the same as the fourth digit following the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{1}$."
