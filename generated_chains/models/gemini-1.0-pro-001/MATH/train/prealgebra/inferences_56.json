At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy co-worker Larry only likes numbers that are divisible by 4, such as 20, or 4,004.  How many different ones digits are possible in numbers that Larry likes?",
        "inference": "Larry likes numbers that are divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4. There are 25 different two-digit numbers that are divisible by 4: 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96.\nThe last digit of a number that is divisible by 4 can be any of these 25 two-digit numbers.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$25$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a number is divisible by 4, then it is divisible by 2, which means that its last digit must be even.  The numbers 20, 12, 24, 16, and 28 show that any even digit is possible, so the number of possible last digits is $\\boxed{5}$."
