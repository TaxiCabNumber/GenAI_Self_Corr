I hope it is correct.'\nIn order for Mateen to walk a kilometer(1000m) in his rectangular backyard, he must walk the length 25 times or walk its perimeter 10 times. What is the area of Mateen's backyard in square meters?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the length of the backyard as L and the width as W.\n\nSince Mateen must walk the length 25 times to cover 1000m, we have:\n\n25 * L = 1000\n\u21d2 L = 1000/25 = 40m\n\nNow, let's consider the perimeter of the backyard:\n\nPerimeter = 2 * (L + W)\nSince Mateen walks the perimeter 10 times to cover 1000m, we have:\n\n10 * (2 * (L + W)) = 1000\n\u21d2 2 * (L + W) = 100\n\u21d2 L + W = 50\n\nWe know that L = 40m, so we can solve for W:\n\nL + W = 50\n\u21d2 W = 50 - L\n\u21d2 W = 50 - 40\n\u21d2 W = 10m\n\nTherefore, the area of Mateen's backyard is:\n\nArea = L * W\n\u21d2 Area = 40m * 10m\n\u21d2 Area = 400 square meters\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{400}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter is $1000\\div 10=100$, and this is two lengths and two widths. The length of the backyard is $1000\\div 25=40$. Since two lengths total 80, the two widths total 20, and the width is 10. The area is $10\\times 40=\\boxed{400}$."
