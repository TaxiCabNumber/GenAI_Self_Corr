At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and nickel both come up heads?",
        "inference": "There are $2^4 = 16$ possible outcomes when four coins are flipped. The penny and the nickel can both come up heads in four of these outcomes: HHTT, HTHT, THHT, and TTHH. Thus, the probability that the penny and nickel both come up heads is $\\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). There are 2 possibilities for the dime and 2 for the quarter, so there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ successful outcomes, and the probability of this is $\\dfrac{4}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}$."
