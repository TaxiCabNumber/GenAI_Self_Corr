        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the smallest positive two-digit multiple of 3.**\n\nThe smallest positive two-digit number is 10. The next multiple of 3 after 10 is 12, which is two-digit. Therefore, the smallest positive two-digit multiple of 3 is 12.\n\n**Step 2: Find the smallest positive three-digit multiple of 4.**\n\nThe smallest positive three-digit number is 100. The next multiple of 4 after 100 is 104, which is three-digit. Therefore, the smallest positive three-digit multiple of 4 is 104.\n\n**Step 3: Find the sum of the two numbers.**\n\n$$a + b = 12 + 104 = 116$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$116$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing 10 by 3 gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1. Therefore, $3 \\cdot 3$ is the largest one-digit multiple of 3, and $3 \\cdot 4$ is the least positive two-digit multiple of 3. This calculation shows that $a=12$.\n\nDividing 100 by 4 gives a quotient of 25 and no remainder. Therefore, $4 \\cdot 25$ is the least positive three-digit multiple of 4, and $b=100$.\n\nCombining these results gives $a+b = 12+100 = \\boxed{112}$."
