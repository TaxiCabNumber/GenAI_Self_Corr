        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest integer $x$ for which $\\frac79 > \\frac{x}{13}$?",
        "inference": "In order to solve the inequality $\\frac79 > \\frac{x}{13}$, we can cross-multiply to obtain $9x < 7 \\cdot 13 = 91$.\nDividing both sides by $9$, we get $x < 10.111\\ldots$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the greatest possible value of $x$ is $x = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $13$, we have $\\frac{91}{9}>x$. The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{91}{9}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
