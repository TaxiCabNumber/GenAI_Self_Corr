        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo bake $12$ cookies, I use $2$ quarts of milk. There are $2$ pints in a quart. How many pints of milk do I need to bake $3$ cookies?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Convert quarts to pints: $2$ quarts $\\times 2$ pints/quart $= 4$ pints\n2. Set up a proportion: $\\frac{12 \\texttt{ cookies}}{2 \\texttt{ pints}} = \\frac{3 \\texttt{ cookies}}{x \\texttt{ pints}}$\n3. Cross-multiply: $12x = 6$\n4. Divide both sides by $12$: $x = \\frac{1}{2}$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, convert quarts to pints. $1$ quart is $2$ pints, so $2$ quarts is $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ pints. So, it takes $4$ pints of milk to bake $12$ cookies. Because the proportion of milk to cookies is constant, divide both the pints of milk and the number of cookies by $4$ to obtain that $\\boxed{1}$ pint of milk is needed to bake $3$ cookies."
