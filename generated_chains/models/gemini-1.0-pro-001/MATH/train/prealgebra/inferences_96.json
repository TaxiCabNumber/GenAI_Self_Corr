At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that the penny and dime both come up the same?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of the penny and dime both coming up heads.\n\nP(penny heads, dime heads) = P(penny heads) * P(dime heads) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability of the penny and dime both coming up tails.\n\nP(penny tails, dime tails) = P(penny tails) * P(dime tails) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\n**Step 3:** Add the probabilities from steps 1 and 2 to find the probability of the penny and dime both coming up the same.\n\nP(penny and dime same) = P(penny heads, dime heads) + P(penny tails, dime tails) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$1/2$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails).  There are 2 possibilities for the penny and the dime: either they're both heads or they're both tails.  There are also 2 possibilities for the nickel and 2 possibilities for the quarter.  So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{8}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
