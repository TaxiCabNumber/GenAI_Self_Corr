At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach interior angle of a regular polygon measures $140^\\circ$. How many sides does the polygon have?",
        "inference": "Let the number of sides in the polygon be $n$. Then, the sum of interior angles of the polygon is $(n-2)180^\\circ$. Since each interior angle measures $140^\\circ$, we have\n\n$$(n-2)180^\\circ=140^\\circ n$$ $$\\Rightarrow 360^\\circ-180^\\circ n=140^\\circ n$$ $$\\Rightarrow 360^\\circ=320^\\circ n$$ $$\\Rightarrow n=\\frac{360^\\circ}{320^\\circ}=\\boxed{9}.$$  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $140^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $140n$.  Therefore, we must have  \\[180(n-2) = 140n.\\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 140n$, so $40n = 360$ and $n = \\boxed{9}$.\n\nWe might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\\circ - 140^\\circ = 40^\\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\\circ$, so there must be $\\frac{360^\\circ}{40^\\circ} = 9$ of them in the polygon."
