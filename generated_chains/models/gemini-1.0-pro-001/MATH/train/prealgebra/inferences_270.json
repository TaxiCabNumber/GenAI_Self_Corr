At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Friday, a snowboard originally priced at $\\$100$ was discounted $50\\%$. On Monday, that sale price was reduced by $30\\%$. In dollars, what is the price of the snowboard after the Monday reduction?",
