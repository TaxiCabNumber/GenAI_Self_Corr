At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a triangle is 600 square feet. Find the altitude, in feet, of the triangle if the length of the corresponding base is 30 feet.",
        "inference": "The area of a triangle is given by the formula:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$$\n\nwhere \n\n* A is the area in square feet\n* b is the length of the base in feet\n* h is the altitude or height in feet\n\nWe are given that the area of the triangle is 600 square feet and the length of the corresponding base is 30 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$600 = \\frac{1}{2}(30)h$$\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\n$$h = \\frac{600}{\\frac{1}{2}(30)} = \\frac{600}{15} = 40$$\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the triangle is 40 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$40$}.

        "ground_truth": "We know that the area of a triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the altitude of the triangle. Since we know that the area of the triangles is $600$ sq. feet and the base is $30$ feet, we have that $600 = \\frac{1}{2} (30)h$, so $600=15h$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $15$, we have that $h=40$. The altitude of the triangle is $\\boxed{40}$ feet."
