At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn her previous five attempts Sarah had achieved times, in seconds, of 86, 94, 97, 88 and 96, for swimming 50 meters. After her sixth try she brought her median time down to 92 seconds. What was her time, in seconds, for her sixth attempt?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nMedian is the middle value when the values are assorted in the order from smallest to largest. The given values are\n86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\nAfter 6th attempt, median drops down to 92, therefore, her time for 6th attempt must be less than 92. \nNow, median is the average of middle two values when the values are assorted in the order from smallest to largest. After the sixth attempt value, new data set is-\n86, 88, 92, 94, 96, 97.\nMedian =$\\frac{92+94}{2}=93$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{93}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Listing her first 5 times in ascending order, we get  \\[86,88,94,96,97\\] Because the final median is 92 and that is between 88 and 94, the final time must also lie in this spot. Thus, we have \\[86,88,x,94,96,97\\] Because there are an even number of elements, the median is the mean of the center two. Thus, for the mean to be 92, $x$ must be $\\boxed{90}~\\text{seconds}$."
