At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we roll a standard fair 6-sided die.  What is the probability that a perfect square is rolled?",
        "inference": "The numbers that are perfect squares on a 6-sided die are 1 and 4.\nSo, there are 2 ways to roll a perfect square.\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die is 6.\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a perfect square is:\n\n$$P(\\text{perfect square}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{3}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A 1 or 4 can be rolled for success, which is 2 out of 6 possible outcomes, so its probability is $\\dfrac26 = \\boxed{\\dfrac13}$."
