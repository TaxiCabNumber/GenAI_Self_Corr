At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has a side of length 6 cm, a side of length 8 cm and a right angle. What is the shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle? Express your answer in centimeters as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the area of the triangle using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$.\nWe can use the right angle side as the base, 6 cm, and the other side as the height, 8 cm. So, $A = \\frac{1}{2} * 6 * 8 = 24$ cm\u00b2.\n\n**Step 2**: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side, $c$:\n$c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2abcos(C)$, where  $C = 90\u00b0$\n\n**Step 3**: Substitute the values into the Pythagorean theorem:\n$c\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2 - 2 * 6 * 8 * cos(90\u00b0) = 36 + 64 - 0 = 100$\n\n**Step 4**: Take the square root of both sides to find $c$:\n$c = \\sqrt{100} = 10$ cm\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$10.00$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The remaining side is minimized if it is a leg of the triangle rather than the hypotenuse.  Then its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt 7\\approx \\boxed{5.29}$ cm."
