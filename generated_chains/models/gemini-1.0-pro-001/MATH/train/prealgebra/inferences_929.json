At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPete thinks of a number. He doubles it, adds 10, multiplies by 4, and ends up with 120. What was his original number?",
        "inference": "Let's call Pete's original number $x$.\n- Step 1: \"He doubles it.\" So, $2x$.\n- Step 2: \"Adds 10.\" So, $2x+10$.\n- Step 3: \"Multiplies by 4.\" So, $4(2x+10) = 8x+40$.\n\nWe know that this final result is equal to 120, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$8x + 40 = 120$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$8x = 120 - 40$\n$8x = 80$\n$x = \\frac{80}{8}$\n$x = 10$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{10}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let Pete's original number be $x$.  If he double it and adds 10, he will have $$2x+10.$$ After multiplying by 4, Pete ended up with 120.
