At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three consecutive integers is 210. What is their sum?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the three consecutive integers as x, x + 1, and x + 2.\n\nAccording to the given information, we have:\n\nx * (x + 1) * (x + 2) = 210\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 210\n\nSolving the equation for x:\n\nx^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 210 = 0\n(x - 5)(x^2 + 8x + 42) = 0\n\nSince x^2 + 8x + 42 has no real solutions, we have:\n\nx - 5 = 0\nx = 5\n\nTherefore, the three consecutive integers are 5, 6, and 7. Their sum is:\n\n5 + 6 + 7 = **18**\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We find the prime factorization of 210 to be $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. Noticing that $2 \\cdot 3=6$, we have 5, 6, and 7 as consecutive integers whose product is 210. So, our answer is $5+6+7=\\boxed{18}$."
