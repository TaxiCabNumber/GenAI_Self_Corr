        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe marble statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial has a height of 60 feet. A scale model of the statue has a height of 4 inches. How many feet of the statue does one inch of the model represent?",
        "inference": "Divide the height of the statue by the height of the model.\n\n\n$$\\frac{60 \\text{ ft}}{4 \\text{ in}}=\\boxed{15 \\text{ ft/in}}$$\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15 \\text{ ft/in}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio between a length on the model and a length on the statue is $4\\text{ inches}: 60\\text{ feet}$. Dividing both sides by 4, we have that 1 inch on the model corresponds to $60/4=\\boxed{15}$ feet on the statue."
