At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n12 balls numbered 1 through 12 are placed in a bin.  In how many ways can 3 balls be drawn, in order, from the bin, if each ball remains outside the bin after it is drawn?",

For the third draw, any 1 of the 10 remaining balls can be chosen.  Therefore, the number of ways of choosing the balls is \\(12\\times 11 \\times 10\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1320$}. I hope it is correct.",
