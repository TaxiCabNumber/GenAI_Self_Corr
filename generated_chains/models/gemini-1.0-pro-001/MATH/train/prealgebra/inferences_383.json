At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nShari walks at a constant rate of 3 miles per hour. After 1.5 hours, how many miles did she walk? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Convert the time from hours to minutes: 1.5 hours = 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes\n2. Multiply the rate by the time: 3 miles per hour * 90 minutes = 270 miles\n3. Express the answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth: 270 miles = **27.0 miles**\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{27.0}$. I hope it is correct.**",
