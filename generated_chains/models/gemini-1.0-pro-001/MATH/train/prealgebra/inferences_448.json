        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen students are taking both algebra and drafting. There are 24 students taking algebra. There are 11 students who are taking drafting only. How many students are taking algebra or drafting but not both?",
        "inference": "There are 24 students taking algebra, and 11 students taking drafting only, so there are 24 + 11 = 35 students taking algebra or drafting in total.\n\n10 students are taking both algebra and drafting, so there are 35 - 10 = 25 students taking algebra or drafting but not both.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$25$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $24-10=14$ students taking algebra only and $11$ students taking drafting only.  So there are $14+11=\\boxed{25}$ students taking algebra or drafting but not both."
