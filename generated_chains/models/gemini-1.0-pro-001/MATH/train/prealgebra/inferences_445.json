        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexia designed a logo 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall to be used on her school's notebooks. The school wants the logo on the notebook to be 8 inches wide. How tall, in inches, will it be if it is enlarged proportionately?",
        "inference": "Since the logo is enlarged proportionately, the ratio of the new width to the old width must be equal to the ratio of the new height to the old height.\n$$\\frac{New\\ width}{Old\\ width}=\\frac{New\\ height}{Old\\ height}$$\n\nWe know that the new width is 8 inches and the old width is 2 inches.\n$$\\frac{New\\ width}{Old\\ width}=\\frac{8}{2}=4$$\n\nSo, the new height will be 4 times the old height.\n$$New\\ height=4\\times Old\\ height$$\n\nThe old height is 1.5 inches.\n$$New\\ height=4\\times1.5=6$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the width goes from 2 inches to 8 inches, it has been multiplied by 4.  If the picture is enlarged proportionately, then the height will also be multiplied by 4.  Therefore, the enlarged logo is $1.5\\times4=\\boxed{6}$ inches tall."
