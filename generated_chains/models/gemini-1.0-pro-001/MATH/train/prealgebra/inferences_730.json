At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand of a 12-hour clock at 6:48?",
        "inference": "The difference between 6 and 12 is 6 hours.\nEach hour represents 30 degrees on the clock face (360/12)\nTherefore, the hour hand has moved 6 x 30 = 180 degrees.\nThe minute hand has moved 48 minutes past the hour.\nEach minute represents 6 degrees on the clock face (360/60)\nTherefore, the minute hand has moved 48 x 6 = 288 degrees.\nThe acute angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the difference between these two angles.\nSo the angle is 288 - 180 = 108 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{108}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At 6:48, the minute hand is $\\frac{12}{60}(360^\\circ)=72$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The hour hand is $\\frac{5\\frac{12}{60}}{12}(360^\\circ)=156$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The difference in the two positions is $156^\\circ-72^\\circ=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
