        "ground_truth": "Begin by factoring the two numbers. $400$ factors into $2^4\\cdot5^2$, while $576$ factors into $2^6\\cdot3^2$. In order for $400x$ to be a multiple of $576$, the prime factorization of $400x$ must include the entire prime factorization of $576$.  Since the prime factorization of 576 has two more 2's and two more 3's than the prime factorization of 400, we know that the prime factorization of $x$ must include at least two 2's and at least two 3's.
