At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?",
        "inference": "Since $4n$ is greater than 0 and less than 30, $n$ must be greater than 0 and less than 7.5. Therefore, the possible integer values of $n$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The sum of these values is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$28$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing by $4$, we have $0<n<7\\frac{1}{2}$. The integer solutions to this chain of inequalities are $n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. The sum of these integers is $\\boxed{28}$."
