At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many different negative values of $x$ is $\\sqrt{x +150}$ a positive integer?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $\\sqrt{x +150}$ is a positive integer, $x +150$ must be a perfect square. The perfect squares between 1 and 150 are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144$. Subtracting 150 from each of these numbers gives:\n\n$-149, -146, -141, -134, -125, -114, -101, -86, -69, -50, -29, -6$.\n\nOut of these numbers, only $-149$ is negative.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $\\sqrt{x + 150} = n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.  Then $x + 150 = n^2$, so $x = n^2 - 150$.  We see that $x$ is negative for $n = 1$, 2, 3, $\\dots$, 12, but positive for $n \\ge 13$, so the number of possible values of $x$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
