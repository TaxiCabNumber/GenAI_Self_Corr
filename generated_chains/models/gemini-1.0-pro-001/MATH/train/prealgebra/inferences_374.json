At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA recipe for 30 cookies requires two cups of flour among its ingredients. Eduardo wants to bake five dozen cookies. How many cups of flour will he need to use in his adjusted recipe?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Convert 5 dozen cookies to number of cookies: 5 dozen = 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 cookies\n\n2. Determine the ratio of cookies to cups of flour in the original recipe: 30 cookies / 2 cups of flour = 15 cookies / 1 cup of flour\n\n3. Use the ratio to calculate the number of cups of flour needed for 60 cookies: 60 cookies \u00d7 (1 cup of flour / 15 cookies) = 4 cups of flour\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Eduardo wants to make twice as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, he must double the amount of flour required: $(2\\text{ cups})\\times2=\\boxed{4}$ cups."
