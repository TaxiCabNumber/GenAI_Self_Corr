At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular polygon has sides of length 5 units and an exterior angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the polygon, in units?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:**  Since the exterior angle is 120 degrees, the interior angle is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.\n**Step 2:**  The number of sides is 360 / 60 = 6.\n**Step 3:**  The perimeter is 6 * 5 = 30 units.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{30}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If an exterior angle has measure $120$ degrees, an interior angle has measure $60$ degrees.  A regular polygon with $60$ degree angles must be an equilateral triangle, so the perimeter is $3(5)=\\boxed{15}$ units."
