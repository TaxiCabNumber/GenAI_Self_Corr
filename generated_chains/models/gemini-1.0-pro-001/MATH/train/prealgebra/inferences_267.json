        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJar A has exactly four red buttons and eight blue buttons.  Carla then removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from Jar A and places them in an empty Jar B.  Jar A now has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of its original number of buttons.  If Carla were now to randomly choose a button from Jar A and a button from Jar B, what is the probability that the two chosen buttons will both be red?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nJar A has 12 buttons originally.  After Carla removes the same number of red buttons as blue buttons from Jar A, Jar A has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of its original number of buttons.  This means Jar A now has $\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot12=8$ buttons.  Since there are four red buttons in Jar A originally, Carla must have removed four red buttons and four blue buttons.  Therefore, Jar B now has four red buttons and four blue buttons.  The probability of choosing a red button from Jar A is $\\frac{4}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of choosing a red button from Jar B is $\\frac{4}{8}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability of choosing two red buttons is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two-thirds of Jar A's original $4+8=12$ buttons is 8 buttons.  Therefore, four buttons were removed from Jar A: two red buttons and two blue buttons.  So the probability that the button drawn from Jar A is red is $\\frac{2}{8}$ and the probability that the button drawn from Jar B is red is $\\frac{2}{4}$.  Therefore, the probability that both buttons are red is $\\dfrac{2}{8}\\cdot\\dfrac{2}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
