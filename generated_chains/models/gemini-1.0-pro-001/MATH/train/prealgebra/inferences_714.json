At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo promote her school's annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. For her small kite, Genevieve draws the kite on a grid with the points one inch apart, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nfor ( int x = 0; x <= 6; ++x )\n{\n\nfor ( int y = 0; y <= 7; ++y )\n\n{\n\ndot((x,y));\n\n}\n}\ndraw((0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--(3,0)--cycle);\n[/asy]\n\nFor the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.\n\nWhat is the number of square inches in the area of the small kite?",
        "inference": "The kite is a triangle. Thus, we need to find the base and height of the kite, and then substitute these values into the formula for the area of a triangle:\n$$Area=\\frac{1}{2}bh$$\nTo find the base, we count the number of squares along the bottom of the kite, which is 6. To find the height, we count the number of squares along the side of the kite, which is 5.\n$$Base=6, Height=5\\\\Area=\\frac{1}{2}(6)(5)\\\\Area=3(5)\\\\\\boxed{Final Answer: 15}. I hope it is correct.$$",
        "ground_truth": "The kite can be divided into two triangles, each with base 7 and altitude 3.  Each area is $(1/2)(7)(3) = 10.5$, so the total area is $2(10.5) = \\boxed{21}$ square inches."
