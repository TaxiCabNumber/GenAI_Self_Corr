At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two 2-digit numbers is $3774$. What is the smaller of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $xy$ and $zw$. \nThen, $xyzw=3774$ and $x,y,z,w \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$.\nSince $xyzw=3774$, the last digit of $xyzw$ is $4$. \nTherefore, the last digits of $xy$ and $zw$ are $4$ and $9$, or $4$ and $6$. \nSince $xy$ and $zw$ are 2-digit numbers, $xy$ cannot be $49$ or $46$, and $zw$ cannot be $94$ or $64$. \nTherefore, $xy$ must be $94$ and $zw$ must be $40$. \nThe smaller of the two numbers is $40$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$.

        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 3774 is $3774=2\\cdot3\\cdot17\\cdot37$.\n\n$2$ and $3$ are troublesome here, because they are both 1-digit factors. We can deal with them by multiplying them by some other factor to produce a bigger factor.\n\nOne thing we might try is multiplying them together, but $2\\cdot3=6$ is still only one digit.\n\nIf we try to put both of them with the $17$, that produces $2\\cdot3\\cdot17=102$, which is too many digits. Putting them with the $37$ would be even bigger, so that won't work either.\n\nSo we have to put one of them with each of the other factors. We can't put $3$ with $37$ because $3\\cdot37=111>100$, so the only thing we can do is say $2\\cdot37=74$ and $3\\cdot17=51$. The smaller of those two is $\\boxed{51}$."
