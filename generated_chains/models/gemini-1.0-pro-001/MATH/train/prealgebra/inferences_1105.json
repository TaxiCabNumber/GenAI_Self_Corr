At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nXanthia buys hot dogs that come in packages of six, and she buys hot dog buns that come in packages of eight. What is the smallest number of hot dog packages she can buy in order to be able to buy an equal number of hot dogs and hot dog buns?",
        "inference": "To find the smallest number of hot dog packages Xanthia can buy, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8 to determine the smallest number that is divisible by both.\n\nStep 1: Prime factorize both numbers.\n\n6 = 2 x 3\n8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2^3\n\nStep 2: Identify the highest power of each prime factor used in either number.\n\nThe highest power of 2 is 2^3, and the highest power of 3 is 3^1.\n\nStep 3: Multiply these highest powers together to get the LCM.\n\nLCM = 2^3 x 3^1 = 8 x 3 = 24\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of hot dog packages Xanthia needs to buy is 24/6 = 4.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To solve this problem, we first find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8. $6=2\\cdot3$ and $8=2^3$, so their LCM is $2^3\\cdot3=24$. Therefore, Xanthia can buy $24\\div6=\\boxed{4}$ hot dog packages and $24\\div8=3$ hot dog bun packages to have an equal number of hot dogs and hot dog buns."
