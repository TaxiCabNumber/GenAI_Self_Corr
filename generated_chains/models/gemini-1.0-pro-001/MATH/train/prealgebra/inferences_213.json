I hope it is correct.'\nGage skated 1 hr 15 min each day for 5 days and 1 hr 30 min each day for 3 days.  How many minutes would he have to skate the ninth day in order to average 85 minutes of skating each day for the entire time?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**\n\nConvert all times to minutes:\n\n5 days x 1 hr 15 min/day x 60 min/hr = 375 minutes\n3 days x 1 hr 30 min/day x 60 min/hr = 270 minutes\n\n**Step 2**\n\nCalculate total skating time over 8 days:\n\n375 minutes + 270 minutes = 645 minutes\n\n**Step 3**\n\nCalculate average skating time over 8 days:\n\n645 minutes \u00f7 8 days = 80.625 minutes\n\n**Step 4**\n\nCalculate additional skating time needed on the ninth day:\n\n85 minutes (target average) - 80.625 minutes (current average) = 4.375 minutes\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$4.375$ minutes}.

        "ground_truth": "In 5 days, Gage skated for $5 \\times 75 =375$ minutes, and in 3 days he skated for $3 \\times 90 = 270$ minutes.  So, in 8 days he skated for $375 + 270 = 645$ minutes.  To average 85 minutes per day for 9 days he must skate $9 \\times 85 = 765$ minutes, so he must skate $765-645=\\boxed{120}$ minutes = 2 hours the ninth day."
