What is the area of the triangle in square meters?\n\n>> The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n\n$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$\n\n>> In this problem, the longest side is the hypotenuse, and the shortest side is one of the legs. Let's call the length of the hypotenuse $c$ and the length of the shortest side $a$. We know that $c = 5$ and $a = 3$.\n\n>> We don't know the length of the other leg, but we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find it. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In other words:\n\n$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$\n\n>> Substituting the values we know into this equation, we get:\n\n$5^2 = 3^2 + b^2$\n$25 = 9 + b^2$\n$b^2 = 16$\n$b = 4$\n\n>> Now that we know the lengths of all three sides, we can substitute them into the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\n$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b$\n$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4$\n$Area = 6$\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 6 square meters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\\\boxed{6}$.

        "ground_truth": "We know that the hypotenuse (the longest side) of the right triangle is $5$ meters and the shortest side is $3$ meters and that $3,4,5$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, the other leg of the triangle must have a length of $4$ meters. Since the two legs are also the base and the height of the triangle, we have that the area of the triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = \\boxed{6}$ square meters.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the Pythagorean Formula to find the length of the other side. If $y$ is the length of the other leg, then we have that $3^2 + y^2 = 5^2$, so $y^2=5^2-3^2=16$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $y=4$. Since we have the lengths of both legs, we can now find that the area of the triangle is $6$ square meters."
