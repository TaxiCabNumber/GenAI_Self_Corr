At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe figure shows three squares with non-overlapping interiors. The area of the shaded square is 1 square inch.

        "inference": "**Solution:** \nThe area of the figure $ABCD$ is $3\\times2=6$ square inches. The area of the shaded square is $1$ square inch, so the area of the unshaded square is $6-1=5$ square inches. The area of the unshaded square is $1+5=6$ square inches.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The two small squares on the left-hand side both have side length $1$, so both have area $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. The larger square on the right has side length twice that of one of the smaller squares, giving it a side length of $2$ and an area of $4$. Thus, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $1 + 1 + 4 = \\boxed{6}$ square inches."
