At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBill buys a stock that decreases by $20\\%$ on the first day, and then  on the second day the stock increases by $30\\%$ of its value at the end of the first day. What was the overall percent increase in Bill's stock over the two days?",
        "inference": "Day 1: Stock decreases by 20%, so Bill has 80% of his original investment.\nDay 2: Stock increases by 30% of 80%, or 24%.\n\nOverall percent increase = 24%\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original value of the stock be $x$. At the end of the first day, the stock has fallen to $.8x$. On the second day, the stock rises to $1.3(.8x)=1.04x$. Thus, the stock has increased $\\boxed{4}$ percent from its original price over the two days."
