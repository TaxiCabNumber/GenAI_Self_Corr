At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the area of a circle is less than $60\\pi$ square inches, what is the greatest possible integer value in inches of the radius of the circle?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.  If the area of a circle is less than $60\\pi$ square inches, then $\\pi r^2 < 60\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get $r^2 < 60$.  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $r < \\sqrt{60} \\approx 7.746$.  Since the radius of a circle must be an integer, the greatest possible integer value for the radius of the circle is $\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.",
