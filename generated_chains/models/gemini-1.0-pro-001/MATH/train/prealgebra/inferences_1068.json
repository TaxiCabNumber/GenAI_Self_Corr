At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the end of a game, each of the five members of a basketball team shake hands with each of the five members of the other team, and all of the players shake hands with the two referees. How many handshakes occur?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Handshakes between the two teams**\n\nEach member of the first team shakes hands with each member of the second team, which is a total of 5 x 5 = 25 handshakes.\n\n**Step 2: Handshakes with the referees**\n\nEach member of either team shakes hands with both referees, which is a total of 2 x 5 x 2 = 20 handshakes.\n\n**Step 3: Total handshakes**\n\nAdding the handshakes from both steps, we get 25 + 20 = 45 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$45$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider the five members of one team shaking hands with each of the five members of the other team, we can simply count the number of hands the members of one team shake, since this will necessarily count all of the handshakes of the other team. Thus, as each of the five people shakes five hands, this gives $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ handshakes. There are ten basketball players total, and if each shakes hands with two referees, this gives $10 \\cdot 2 = 20$ more handshakes. Thus, a total of $25 + 20 = \\boxed{45}$ handshakes occur."
