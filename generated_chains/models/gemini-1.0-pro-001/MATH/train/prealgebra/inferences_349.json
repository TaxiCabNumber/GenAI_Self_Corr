At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo make lemonade, I use a ratio of $7$ parts water to $1$ part lemon juice. If I want to make a gallon of lemonade, and there are four quarts in a gallon, how many quarts of water do I need? Write your answer as a proper or improper fraction.",
        "inference": "Step 1: Convert the gallon to quarts: $$1 \\text{ gallon} = 4 \\text{ quarts}$$\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of parts in the ratio: $$7 \\text{ parts water} + 1 \\text{ part lemon juice} = 8 \\text{ parts}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of parts of water in a gallon: $$\\frac{7}{8} \\times 4 = 3.5 \\text{ quarts}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To make lemonade, I need a total of $7 + 1 = 8$ parts liquid. Because I am making a gallon of lemonade, each part must be $\\frac{1}{8}$ of a gallon. Converting to quarts gives that each part is $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$ of a quart. Since I have $7$ parts water, I therefore need $7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}$ quarts of water."
