        "ground_truth": "We know that the sum of the interior angles of a $n$-gon is equal to $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon (six sides) is $180(6-2)=180 \\cdot 4$ degrees. Since a regular hexagon has six interior angles with equal degree measures, one of these angles would have a measure of $\\frac{180 \\cdot 4}{6}=30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
