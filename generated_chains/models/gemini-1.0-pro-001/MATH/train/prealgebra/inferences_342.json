If two numbers $u$ and $v$ are added to the list, the mean of the eleven-member list becomes 66. What is the mean of $u$ and $v$?",

After including $u$ and $v$, we have eleven numbers now, and their sum must be $11 \\cdot 66 = 726$. Since the only new numbers in this sum are $u$ and $v$, $u+ v = 726 - 486 = 240$.
