At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of inches in the perimeter of a square is equal to the number of square inches in its area. Find the length, in inches, of a side of the square.",
        "inference": "Let's call the length of a side of the square x inches.\nThe perimeter of the square is 4x inches.\nThe area of the square is x^2 square inches.\nAccording to the problem, 4x = x^2.\nSolving for x, we get x^2 - 4x = 0.\nFactoring, we get x(x - 4) = 0.\nSo, either x = 0 or x - 4 = 0.\nSince the length of a side of a square cannot be 0, we have x - 4 = 0.\nSolving for x, we get x = 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the side length of the square be $x$. Then, the perimeter is $4x$ and the area is $x^2$. We're given that \\[4x=x^2;\\]solving yields $x=4$. Thus, the side length of the square is $\\boxed{4}$ inches."
