At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA set of three numbers has both a mean and median equal to 4. If the smallest number in the set is 1, what is the range of the set of numbers?",
        "inference": "Mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in a dataset. Here, the mean is 4, and there are 3 numbers in the set, so the sum of the three numbers is $3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nMedian is the middle value of a dataset when assorted in numerical order. Since the smallest number in the set is 1, and the median is 4, the largest number in the set must be $7$, so that the sum of the numbers is 12.\n\nTherefore, the range of the set of numbers is $7-1=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the mean of three numbers is 4, then their sum is 12.  Since two of the numbers are 1 and 4, the third number is $12-(1+4)=7$.  The range, which is the difference between the smallest and largest numbers, is $7-1=\\boxed{6}$."
