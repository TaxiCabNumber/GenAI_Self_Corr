I hope it is correct.'\nIn rectangle $ABCD$, $AB = 6$ cm, $BC = 8$ cm, and $DE = DF$. The area of triangle $DEF$ is one-fourth the area of rectangle $ABCD$. What is the length in centimeters of segment $EF$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(0,24)--(32,24)--(32,0)--cycle);\ndraw((13,24)--(32,5));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,24),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(32,0),E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(32,24),E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(13,24),N);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(32,5),E);\n[/asy]",
