At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA list of five positive integers has a median of 3 and a mean of 11. What is the maximum possible value of the list's largest element?",
        "inference": "The mean of the list is the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements, so the sum of the elements is $11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.\n\nThe median is the middle value when the elements are sorted in ascending order. \n\nSince the median is 3, the two middle values must be 3.\n\nThis means that the other three values must sum to $55 - 2 \\cdot 3 = 49$.\n\nThe maximum possible value for the largest element is 49, which occurs when the other three values are 16 each.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{49}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the 5 numbers have a mean of 11, the sum of the numbers is $5\\cdot 11 = 55$.  To make the largest number as large as possible, we make the other numbers must be as small as possible.  However, in order for the median to be 3, the middle number must be 3.  Since this is the middle number, there must be two other numbers that are at least 3.  So, we let three of the other four numbers be 1, 1, and 3 to make them as small as possible.  Finally, this means the remaining number is $55-1-1-3-3=\\boxed{47}$."
