At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree measure of the supplement of the complement of a 42-degree angle?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: The complement of a 42-degree angle is an angle that, when added to it, equals 90 degrees. \n**Step 2**: Therefore, the complement of a 42-degree angle is 90 - 42 = 48 degrees. \n**Step 3**: The supplement of an angle is an angle that, when added to it, equals 180 degrees.\n**Step 4**: Therefore, the supplement of the complement of a 42-degree angle is 180 - 48 = 132 degrees.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{132}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "By definition, the complement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $90^\\circ - \\alpha$, and the supplement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nThus, the complement of a 42-degree angle is $90 - 42 = 48$ degrees, and the supplement of a 48-degree angle is $180 - 48 = \\boxed{132}$ degrees."
