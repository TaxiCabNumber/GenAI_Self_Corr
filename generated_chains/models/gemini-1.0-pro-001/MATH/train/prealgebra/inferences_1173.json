At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSquare A has side lengths each measuring $x$ inches.  Square B  has side lengths each measuring $4x$ inches.  What is the ratio of  the area of the smaller square to the area of the larger square?   Express your answer as a common fraction.",
