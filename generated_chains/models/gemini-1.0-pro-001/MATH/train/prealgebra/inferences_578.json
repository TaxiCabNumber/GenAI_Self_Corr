        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA toy store manager received a large order of Mr. Slinkums just in time for the holidays. The manager places $20\\%$ of them on the shelves, leaving the other 120 Mr. Slinkums in storage. How many Mr. Slinkums were in this order?",
        "inference": "Let $s$ be the total number of Mr. Slinkums in the order.\n\nWe know that $20\\%$ of them were placed on the shelves, which is equivalent to $0.2s$.\n\nThe remaining $120$ Mr. Slinkums were left in storage.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation:\n\n$$0.2s + 120 = s$$\n\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n\n$$0.8s = 120$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{120}{0.8}$$\n\n$$s = 150$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{150}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $20\\%$ of the toys were put on the shelves, the $80\\%$ of the toys were left in storage.  Therefore, we are given $80\\% T=120$, where $T$ is the number of toys in the order.  Rewriting $80\\%$ as $\\frac{4}{5}$ and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{5}{4}$, we find that $T=120\\cdot\\frac{5}{4}=30\\cdot 5=\\boxed{150}$."
