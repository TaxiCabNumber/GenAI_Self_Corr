At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCaroline can make eleven lassis out of two mangoes. How many lassis can she make out of twelve mangoes?",
        "inference": "1. Since Caroline can make eleven lassis out of two mangoes, she can make $11/2$ lassis out of one mango.\n\n2. Thus, she can make $11/2\\cdot12 = 66$ lassis out of twelve mangoes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{66}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have $\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2$.  Multiplying both parts of the ratio by 6 gives \\[\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2 = 66:12,\\]so she can make $\\boxed{66}$ lassis."
