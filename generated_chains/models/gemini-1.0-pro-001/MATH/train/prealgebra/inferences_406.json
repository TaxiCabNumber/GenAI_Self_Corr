        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAfter eating lunch together, Jay and Paul start walking in opposite directions. Jay walks 0.75 miles every 15 minutes and Paul power walks 2.5 miles every 30 minutes. In miles, how far apart are they after 1.5 hours?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert both Jay's and Paul's walking rates to miles per hour.\n- Jay: 0.75 miles / 15 minutes = 3 miles / hour\n- Paul: 2.5 miles / 30 minutes = 5 miles / hour\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total distance each person walks in 1.5 hours.\n- Jay: 3 miles / hour x 1.5 hours = 4.5 miles\n- Paul: 5 miles / hour x 1.5 hours = 7.5 miles\n\n**Step 3:** Find the total distance between them by adding the distances they walked in opposite directions.\n- Total distance = Jay's distance + Paul's distance\n- Total distance = 4.5 miles + 7.5 miles\n- Total distance = 12 miles\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "After 1.5 hours, or 90 minutes, Jay has walked $0.75 \\cdot (90/15) = 4.5$ miles, while Paul has walked $2.5 \\cdot (90/30) = 7.5$ miles. Since they are walking in opposite directions, they are $4.5 + 7.5 = \\boxed{12}$ miles apart."
