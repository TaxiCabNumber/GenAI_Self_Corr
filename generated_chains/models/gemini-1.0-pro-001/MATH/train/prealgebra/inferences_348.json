        "ground_truth": "Problem 5. Let's call the side length of the square $s$. This makes the perimeter of the square $4s$, which we know is 144 units. Solving $4s = 144$ for  $s$, we get $s = 36$. We also can say that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(s + 0.25s)$. Since we found that $s = 36$, we know that the perimeter of each rectangle is $2(36 + (0.25)(36)) = \\boxed{90\\text{ units}}$."
