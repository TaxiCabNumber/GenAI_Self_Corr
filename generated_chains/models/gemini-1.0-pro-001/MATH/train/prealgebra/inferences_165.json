        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI flip a fair coin once and roll a regular six-sided die.  What is the probability the coin will show heads and the die will show a 2?",
        "inference": "1. The probability of getting heads on the coin is 1/2.\n2. The probability of getting a 2 on the die is 1/6.\n3. The probability of both happening is the product of the two probabilities: (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 2 possible outcomes for the coin and 6 possible outcomes for the die, so there are $2 \\times 6 = 12$ equally likely outcomes.  Only 1 of these is a successful outcome: the coin must show heads and the die must show 2.  So the probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
