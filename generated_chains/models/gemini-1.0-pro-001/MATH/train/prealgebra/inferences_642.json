At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne hundred people were surveyed. Of these, $87$ indicated they liked Mozart and $70$ indicated they liked Bach. What is the minimum number of people surveyed who could have said they liked both Mozart and Bach?",
        "inference": "At least $87-70 = 17$ people must have said they liked Mozart only. Also, at least $70-87 = -17$ people must have said they liked Bach only. But this is impossible because a negative number of people cannot be surveyed. Therefore, at least $17$ people must have said they liked both Mozart and Bach.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{17}.
