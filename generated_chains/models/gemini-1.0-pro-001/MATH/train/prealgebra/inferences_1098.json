At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sports conference has 14 teams in two divisions of 7.  How many games are in a complete season for the conference if each team must play every other team in its own division twice and every team in the other division once?",
        "inference": "Each team plays 6 other teams in its division twice, for a total of 12 games within its division.  There are 7 teams in the other division, so each team plays 7 games against teams in the other division.  Thus, each team plays a total of 12 + 7 = 19 games.  There are 14 teams, so the total number of games is 14 * 19 = 266.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{266}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each team plays 6 other teams in its division twice, and the 7 teams in the other division once, for a total of $6 \\times 2 + 7 = 19$ games for each team.  There are 14 teams total, which gives a preliminary count of $19 \\times 14 = 266$ games, but we must divide by two because we have counted each game twice (once for one team and once for the other).  So the final answer is $\\dfrac{19 \\times 14}{2} = \\boxed{133}$ games."
