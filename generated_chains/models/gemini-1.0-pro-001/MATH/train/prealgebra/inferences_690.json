At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix balls, numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, are placed in a hat.  Each ball is equally likely to be chosen.  If one ball is chosen, what is the probability that the number on the selected ball is a prime number?",

        "ground_truth": "Of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, only the numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 are prime.\n\nSince 4 out of the 6 numbers are prime, then the probability of choosing a ball with a prime number is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
