        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt lunch, $60\\%$ of the students selected soda while $20\\%$ selected milk. If 72 students selected soda, how many students selected milk?",
        "inference": "If $60\\%$ of the students selected soda, then $40\\%$ of the students selected milk or other drinks.\nSince 72 students selected soda, the total number of students is $72\\div 0.60 = 120$.\nTherefore, the number of students who selected milk is $120 \\times 0.40 = 48$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{48}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of students who selected milk will be $\\frac{20\\%}{60\\%}=\\frac{1}{3}$ of the number of students who selected soda.  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot 72=\\boxed{24}$ students selected milk."
