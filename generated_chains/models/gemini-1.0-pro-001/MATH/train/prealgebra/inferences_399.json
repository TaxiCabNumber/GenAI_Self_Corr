At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKoalas absorb only $25\\%$ of the fiber they eat. A koala absorbed 10.5 ounces of fiber in one day. How many ounces of fiber did he eat that day?",
        "inference": "1. We know that the koala absorbed 10.5 ounces of fiber in one day.\n2. We also know that koalas absorb only 25% of the fiber they eat.\n3. So, to find out how many ounces of fiber the koala ate that day, we can set up a proportion:\n$\\frac{10.5}{x} = \\frac{25}{100}$\n4. Cross-multiplying, we get:\n$10.5 \\times 100 = 25x$\n5. Solving for x, we get:\n$x = \\frac{10.5 \\times 100}{25} = 42$\n6. Therefore, the koala ate 42 ounces of fiber that day.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$42$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We seek the answer to the question \"10.5 ounces is 25% of what number?\" If we call the unknown number of ounces $x$, we have the equation $10.5=0.25x$. Dividing both sides by $0.25$, we have $x=\\frac{10.5}{0.25}=\\boxed{42}$ ounces of fiber."
