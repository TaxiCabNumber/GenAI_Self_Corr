At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many multiples of 10 are between 11 and 103?",

The list of multiples is $20$, $30$, $\\ldots$, $100$. Divide each of these numbers by $10$ to get the list $2$, $3$, $\\ldots$, $10$. Subtracting $1$ from each number in this list gives a new list of $1$, $2$, $\\ldots $, $9$, so it is clear that there are $\\boxed{9}$ such numbers."
