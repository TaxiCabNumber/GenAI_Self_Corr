At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of games played within each division.\n\n* Each team plays 5 other teams in its division twice, resulting in 10 games per team.\n* Total games within a division: 10 games/team * 6 teams = 60 games\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of games played between divisions.\n\n* Each team plays 6 teams in the other division once, resulting in 6 games per team.\n* Total games between divisions: 6 games/team * 6 teams = 36 games\n\n**Step 3:** Add the games played within and between divisions to get the total number of conference games.\n\n* Total conference games = Games within divisions + Games between divisions\n* Total conference games = 60 games + 36 games = 96 games\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$96$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled."
