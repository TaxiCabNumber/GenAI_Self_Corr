At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive 3-digit numbers are divisible by 7?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nA number is divisible by 7 if the last digit is either 0 or 7 and the sum of the digits is divisible by 7.\n\nThere are 2 choices for the last digit (0 or 7).\n\nThe sum of the digits must be a multiple of 7. Since the last digit is 0 or 7, the sum of the first two digits must be a multiple of 7.\n\nThere are 9 choices for the first digit (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) and 9 choices for the second digit. However, if the first digit is 9, then the second digit must be 1 or 8. If the first digit is 8, then the second digit must be 2 or 9. This gives a total of 17 possibilities for the first two digits.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive 3-digit numbers that are divisible by 7 is $2\\times 17=\\boxed{34}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $7 \\times 14 = 98 < 100 < 105 = 7 \\times 15$ and $7 \\times 142 = 994 < 1000 < 1001 = 7 \\times 143$.  So the list of 3-digit numbers divisible by 7 is $105,112,\\ldots,994$, and when we divide this list by 7, we get the list $15,16,17,\\ldots,141,142$, which has $142 - 15 + 1 = \\boxed{128}$ numbers."
