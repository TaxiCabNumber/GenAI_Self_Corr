At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 18 miles north, then 11 miles west, then 6 miles south and finally 6 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe traveler ended up $6$ miles north (18 - 6 = 6) and 5 miles west (11 - 6 = 5) from the starting point. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from the starting point is \\begin{align*}\nd &= \\sqrt{5^2 + 6^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{61}\\\\\n&= 7.810249675906654\n\\end{align*}\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{7.81}$**. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In total, the traveler went 12 miles north and 5 miles west. This forms a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{13}$ miles away from the starting point."
