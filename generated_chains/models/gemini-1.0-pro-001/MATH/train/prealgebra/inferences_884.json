At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn 8.5-meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall. How many meters is its base from the wall if the ladder reaches 7.5 meters up the wall?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nImagine a right triangle since the ladder creates a right angle when it touches the ground and the wall.\n\nLet x be the distance the base of the ladder is from the wall\n\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem:\n\n$$x^2 + 7.5^2 = 8.5^2$$\n\n$$x^2 = 8.5^2 - 7.5^2$$\n\n$$x^2 = 72.25 - 56.25$$\n\n$$x^2 = 16$$\n\n$$x = \\sqrt{16}$$\n\n$$x = 4$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have a right triangle where the ratio of one leg to the hypotenuse is $15:17$. Since 8, 15, 17 is a Pythagorean triple, the ratio of the other leg to the hypotenuse must be $8:17$. If the length of this leg is $x$, this means that $x/8.5 = 8/17$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{4}$ meters."
