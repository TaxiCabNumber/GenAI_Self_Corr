I hope it is correct.'\nCutting equilateral triangle $BFC$ out of square $ABCD$ and translating it to the left of the square creates the shaded figure $ABFCDE$.

        "inference": "The original square, $ABCD$, has a side length of $\\frac{48}{4}=12$ inches. So the perimeter of $ABCD$ is $12\\cdot 4=48$ inches.\n\nThe new figure, $ABFCDE$, is made up of the original square, $ABCD$, minus the triangle $BFC$. The area of triangle $BFC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 12\\cdot 12=72$ square inches. So the perimeter of $ABFCDE$ is the perimeter of $ABCD$ minus the perimeter of $BFC$. \n\nThe perimeter of $BFC$ is $12+12+12=36$ inches. So the perimeter of $ABFCDE$ is $48-36=\\boxed{12}$ inches \nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Originally, every side length of the square had a length of 12.  Since the triangle is equilateral, each of its side lengths is also 12.  There are now a total of 6 sides, making for a perimeter of $\\boxed{72}$."
