At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers between 300 and 500 have the sum of their digits equal to 16?",
        "inference": "There are 300 integers between 300 and 500, inclusive. We can consider the sum of the digits of each integer and count how many of them equal 16.\n\nFor an integer to have a sum of digits equal to 16, it must have at least two digits. The smallest such integer is 38. The largest such integer is 477.\n\nThere are 90 integers between 38 and 477, inclusive. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{90}$ integers between 300 and 500 with a sum of digits equal to 16.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have to consider 2 cases:\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 3, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 13. We have $4+9=5+8=6+7=13,$ which yield a total of 6 choices (two for each pair that adds to 13).\n\nWhen the hundreds digit is 4, we want the sum of the tens and unit digit equal to 12. We have $3+9=4+8=5+7=6+6=12.$ The first three pairs give us 2 solutions, but the last only gives 1, so we have a total of 7 choices.\n\nTherefore there are total of $6+7= \\boxed{13}$ integers."
