At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMargaret started a stamp collection. She collected 8 stamps the first day. Each subsequent day she collected 8 more stamps than she had collected the previous day. If she collected stamps for 5 consecutive days, what was the average number of stamps collected per day?",
        "inference": "Day 1: 8 stamps\nDay 2: 16 stamps\nDay 3: 24 stamps\nDay 4: 32 stamps\nDay 5: 40 stamps\n\nTotal number of stamps collected: 8 + 16 + 24 + 32 + 40 = 120 stamps\n\nNumber of days: 5 \n\nAverage number of stamps collected per day: 120 stamps / 5 days = 24 stamps\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$24$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consider the sequence 8, 16, 24, $\\ldots$ of the numbers of stamps collected by Margaret on successive days.  The mean of an arithmetic sequence is equal to its median, so the mean of this five-term arithmetic sequence is equal to the third term $\\boxed{24}$."
