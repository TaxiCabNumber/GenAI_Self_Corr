Therefore, $a+b=4k+8m=4(k+2m)$, which is a multiple of 4 and hence even.\n\nB. $a+b$ must be a multiple of 4. True. Since $a$ is a multiple of 4, $a=4k$ for some integer $k$. Since $b$ is a multiple of 8, $b=8m$ for some integer $m$. Therefore, $a+b=4k+8m=4(k+2m)$, which is a multiple of 4.\n\nC. $a+b$ must be a multiple of 8. False. For example, $a=4$ and $b=10$. Then $a+b=4+10=14$, which is not a multiple of 8.\n\nD. $a+b$ cannot be a multiple of 8. False. For example, $a=8$ and $b=16$.

        "ground_truth": "We assess the statements one at a time.\n\nA. If $a$ is a multiple of 4, then $a=4m$ for some integer $m$. In particular, $a$ can be written as $2\\cdot(2m)$ and therefore is even (recall that being a multiple of 2 is the same as being even). Similarly, $b$ is eight times $n$ for some integer $n$, which means that $b=2\\cdot(4n)$ is also even. Finally, the sum of two even numbers is even. So statement A is true.\n\nB. We are told that $a$ is a multiple of 4. Also, $b$ is eight times $n$ for some integer $n$, which means that $b=4\\cdot(2n)$ is also a multiple of 4. Since the sum of two multiples of 4 is again a multiple of 4, we see that $a+b$ is a multiple of 4. So statement B is true.\n\nC. If we take $a=12$ and $b=8$, we see that $a+b=20$ is not a multiple of 8. Thus statement C is false.\n\nD. If we take $a=16$ and $b=16$, then $a+b=32$ is a multiple of 8. So statement D is false.\n\nSo, the true statements are $\\boxed{\\text{A,B}}$."
