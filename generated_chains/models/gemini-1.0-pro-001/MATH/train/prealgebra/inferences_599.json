I hope it is correct.'\nA church rings its bells every 15 minutes, the school rings its bells every 20 minutes and the day care center rings its bells every 25 minutes. If they all ring their bells at noon on the same day, at what time will they next all ring their bells together?  (Answer in the form AB:CD without am or pm, such as 08:00)",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 20, and 25, which is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by each of these numbers.  \n\nThe prime factorization of 15 is 3 * 5, \nthe prime factorization of 20 is 2 * 2 * 5, and \nthe prime factorization of 25 is 5 * 5. \n\nSo the LCM of 15, 20, and 25 is 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 600.\n\n\n**Step 2**: Since all three bells ring at noon, the next time they will all ring together is in 600 minutes.\n\n\n**Step 3**: Convert 600 minutes to hours and minutes:\n600 minutes = 10 hours and 00 minutes.\n\n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{$10:00$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We simply need to find the Least Common Multiple of 15, 20, and 25.  They can be expressed as $3\\times 5$, $4\\times 5$, $5 \\times 5$ - since 3,4, and 5 are all relatively prime, their LCM is going to be $5 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 300$.  Thus, after 300 minutes, they will ring their bells together again.  300 minutes is 5 hours, so $\\boxed{05\\!:\\!00}$ p.m. will be the next time."
