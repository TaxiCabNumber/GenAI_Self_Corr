At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is three times its width. The perimeter is 160 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let's call the width of the rectangle \"w\" in cm.\n\nThe length of the rectangle is three times its width, so the length is \"3w\" in cm.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. The perimeter is given as 160 cm, so we have the equation:\n\n```\n2(length + width) = 160\n```\n\nSubstituting the expressions for length and width, we get:\n\n```\n2(3w + w) = 160\n```\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n```\n2(4w) = 160\n```\n\n```\n8w = 160\n```\n\nSolving for w:\n\n```\nw = 160 / 8\n```\n\n```\nw = 20\n```\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is 20 cm.\n\nThe length of the rectangle is three times its width, so the length is:\n\n```\n3w = 3(20) = 60 cm\n```\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n```\nArea = length \u00d7 width\n```\n\nSubstituting the values of length and width, we get:\n\n```\nArea = 60 cm \u00d7 20 cm\n```\n\n```\nArea = 1200 cm\u00b2\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1200}. I hope it is correct.",

Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $l$, we get $2(3w)+2w=160$ or $w=20$. Plugging this value into the first equation gives $l=3(20)=60$.
