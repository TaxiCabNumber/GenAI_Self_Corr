At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four partners in a business decide to split the profits of their company in the ratio 2:3:3:5. If the profit one year is $\\$26,\\!000$ what is the largest number of dollars received by any of the four partners?",
        "inference": "Let the share of each partner be 2x, 3x, 3x, and 5x respectively. Then,\n$$2x+3x+3x+5x=26000$$\n$$13x =26000$$\n$$x=2000$$\nTherefore, the largest share is 5x, which is equal to\n$$5x = 5(2000) = 10000$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10000}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "You can think of the money being split into $2+3+3+5$ parts, and each partner getting his corresponding number of parts as his share.  That makes for a total of 13 parts, meaning that each part consists of $\\$2,\\!000,$ and the largest share received is $5\\cdot 2,\\!000 = \\boxed{10,\\!000}$."
