At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJavier is going to Disneyland during spring break. He plans on visiting four particular attractions all before lunch. In how many orders could he visit all four attractions once?",
        "inference": "The number of orders in which Javier could visit the four attractions once is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
