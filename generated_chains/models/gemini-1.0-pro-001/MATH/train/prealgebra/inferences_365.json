At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The number of positive integers less than $101$ that are multiples of $5$ is $\\lfloor 100/5 \\rfloor = 20$, and the number of positive integers less than $101$ that are multiples of $7$ is $\\lfloor 100/7 \\rfloor = 14$. However, we have counted the multiples of $35$ twice, so we need to subtract them. The number of multiples of $35$ less than $101$ is $\\lfloor 100/35 \\rfloor = 2$.

However, the least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, and there are $2$ positive multiples of $35$ less than $101$.  This means there are $20 - 2 = 18$ multiples of $5$ that aren't multiples of $7$, and $14 - 2 = 12$ multiples of 7 that aren't multiples of $5$, for a total of $18 + 12 = \\boxed{30}$."
