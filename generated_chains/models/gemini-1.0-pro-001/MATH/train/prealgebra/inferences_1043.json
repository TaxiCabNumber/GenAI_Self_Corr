I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest odd number with four different prime factors?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. An odd number with four different prime factors must have the form $p_1p_2p_3p_4$, where $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ are all different prime numbers.\n2. The prime numbers less than $10$ are $2,3,5,7$.\n3. The smallest possible value of $p_1$ is $3$, so the smallest possible value of $p_1p_2$ is $3\\cdot5=15$.\n4. The smallest possible value of $p_1p_2p_3$ is $15\\cdot7=105$.\n5. Therefore, the smallest possible odd number with four different prime factors is $105\\cdot2=\\boxed{210}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$210$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number can't have $2$ as a factor, so the next smallest primes are $3$, $5$, $7$, and $11$. Multiply them together to get $\\boxed{1155}$."
