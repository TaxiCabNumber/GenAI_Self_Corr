At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of five children is 6 years old. Each child is a different age and there is a difference of two years in the ages of any two consecutive children. In years, how old is the oldest child?",
        "inference": "Let's first look at the total age of the 5 children. Since the average age is 6, the total age is 5 * 6 = 30 years.\nNow let's assume the youngest child is x years old. Then the other children's ages are x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.\nAdding all these ages, we get: x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20 = 30\nSolving for x, we get: x = 2\nTherefore, the youngest child is 2 years old.\nThe oldest child is x + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 years old.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the ages form an arithmetic progression (an evenly spaced sequence) with an odd number of terms, the median age is the same as the average age.  Therefore, the age of the third child is $6$, the second child is $8$ years old, and the first child is $\\boxed{10}$ years old."
