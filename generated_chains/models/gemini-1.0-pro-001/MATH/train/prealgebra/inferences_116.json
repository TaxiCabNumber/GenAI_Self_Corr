At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose I have 6 shirts and 5 ties.  How many shirt-and-tie outfits can I make?",
        "inference": "To find the number of shirt-and-tie outfits, we need to multiply the number of shirts by the number of ties:\n\nNumber of outfits = Number of shirts \u00d7 Number of ties\n\nNumber of outfits = 6 \u00d7 5\n\nNumber of outfits = 30\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$30$}. I hope it is correct.",
