At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRoslyn has ten boxes. Six of the boxes contain pencils, three of the boxes contain pens, and two of the boxes contain both pens and pencils. How many boxes contain neither pens nor pencils?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are 10 boxes total.\n6 boxes contain pencils.\n3 boxes contain pens.\n2 boxes contain both pens and pencils.\n\nSo, the number of boxes that contain only pencils is 6 - 2 = 4.\nThe number of boxes that contain only pens is 3 - 2 = 1.\nThe number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils is 10 - 4 - 1 - 2 = 3.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "At first, we might think that there are $6+3=9$ boxes with pens or pencils.  However, this counts twice the 2 boxes with both pens and pencils, so we subtract 2 from our total to only count these boxes once.  That gives us $6+3-2=7$ boxes with pens or pencils, which leaves $10-7=\\boxed{3\\text{ boxes}}$ with neither."
