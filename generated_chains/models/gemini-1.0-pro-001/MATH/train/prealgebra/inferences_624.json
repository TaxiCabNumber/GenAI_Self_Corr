At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a history class, the probability of earning an A is .7 times the probability of earning a B, and the probability of earning a C is 1.4 times the probability of earning a B. Assuming that all grades are A, B, or C, how many B's will there be in a history class of 31 students?",
        "inference": "Let the probability of earning a B be $b$. Then the probability of earning an A is $0.7b$, and the probability of earning a C is $1.4b$. Since all grades are A, B, or C, the sum of these probabilities is 1:\n\n$$0.7b+b+1.4b=1$$\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n$$3.1b=1$$\n\nDividing both sides by 3.1:\n\n$$b=\\frac{1}{3.1}\\approx0.323$$\n\nSo, the probability of earning a B is approximately 0.323. In a class of 31 students, the expected number of B's is:\n\n$$31\\times 0.323\\approx10$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of students who earn a B. Then we know that the number of students who get an A is $.7x$ and the number of students who earn a C is $1.4x$. Since every student in the class gets an A, B, or C and there are 31 students, this gives us the equation $.7x + x + 1.4x = 31 \\Rightarrow 3.1x = 31 \\Rightarrow x =\\boxed{10}$."
