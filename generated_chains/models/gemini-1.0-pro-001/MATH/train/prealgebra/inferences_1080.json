At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree of the following test scores are Cyprian's and the other three are Margaret's: 85, 87, 92, 93, 94, 98. Cyprian's mean score is 90. What is Margaret's mean score?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the sum of Cyprian's scores.**\nCyprian's mean score is 90, so the sum of his scores is 90 x 3 = 270.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract Cyprian's scores from the total of all six scores.**\nThe total of all six scores is 85 + 87 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 98 = 549. Subtracting Cyprian's scores gives us 549 - 270 = 279.\n\n**Step 3: Divide the result by 3 to find Margaret's mean score.**\nMargaret has three scores, so her mean score is 279 / 3 = 93.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$93$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of all six scores is $549$.  The sum of Cyprian's scores is $3(90)=270$, so the sum of Margaret's scores is $549-270=279$.  Thus the average of her scores is $\\frac{279}{3}=\\boxed{93}$."
