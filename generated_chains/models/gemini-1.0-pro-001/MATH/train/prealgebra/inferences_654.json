        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular polygon has interior angles of 120 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon with n sides is given by (n - 2) * 180.\nFor a regular polygon with interior angles of 120 degrees, we have:\n(n - 2) * 180 = 120\nDividing both sides by 180, we get:\nn - 2 = 2/3\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get:\nn = 8/3\nSince n must be an integer, the only possible value is **n = 3**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $120^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $120n$.  Therefore, we must have  \\[180(n-2) = 120n.\\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 120n$, so $60n = 360$ and $n = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nWe might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\\circ$, so there must be $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60^\\circ} = 6$ of them in the polygon."
