At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob's favorite number is between $50$ and $100$.  It is a multiple of $11$, but not a multiple of $2$.  The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?",
        "inference": "Since the number is between $50$ and $100$ and a multiple of $11$, it must be one of the following: $55, 66, 77, 88, 99$.\n\nSince the number is not a multiple of $2$, it must be one of the following: $55, 77, 99$.\n\nSince the sum of the digits of the number is a multiple of $3$, only $99$ satisfies this condition.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{99}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will list out the multiples of $11$ between $50$ and $100$, and eliminate all the multiples that don't satisfy the other conditions.  If our work is correct, there should only be one number, the answer, that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThe multiples of $11$ that we are interested in are $55$, $66$, $77$, $88$, and $99$. $66$ and $88$ are multiples of $2$, so they are out.  Now, of the remaining numbers, only $99$ has a digit-sum that is a multiple of $3$ ($9+9=18$).  Therefore, Bob's favorite number is $\\boxed{99}$."
