        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe have a cube with 4 blue faces and 2 red faces.  What's the probability that when it is rolled, a blue face will be facing up?",
        "inference": "There are 6 possible outcomes when a cube is rolled. Since there are 4 blue faces, there are 4 possible outcomes where a blue face is facing up.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a blue face is 4/6 = 2/3.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2/3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have 6 equally likely outcomes, corresponding to the 6 faces of the cube.  4 of those 6 outcomes are successful ones (meaning a blue face is facing up).  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
