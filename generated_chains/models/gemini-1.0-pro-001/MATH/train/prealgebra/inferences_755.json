At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Frank's Fruit Market, 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, and 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges.  How many oranges cost as much as 18 bananas?",
        "inference": "1. 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, so each apple is worth 3/2 banana.\n2. 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges, so each orange is worth 6/4 = 3/2 apples.\n3. Therefore, each orange is worth 3/2 * 3/2 = 9/4 bananas.\n4. 18 bananas are worth 18 * 9/4 = 40.5 oranges.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because 3 bananas cost as much as 2 apples, 18 bananas cost as much as 12 apples.  Because 6 apples cost as much as 4 oranges, 12 apples cost as much as 8 oranges. Therefore 18 bananas cost as much as $\\boxed{8}$ oranges."
