At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?",
        "inference": "The formula for the area of a circle is $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, so $d = 2r$. If the actual diameter is 20 cm, then the actual radius is 10 cm.\n\nJuan's measurement has an error of up to 20%, which means that his measured diameter could be up to 20% more or 20% less than the actual diameter. The largest possible error in his computed area of the circle will occur when his measured diameter is 20% less than the actual diameter. In this case, his measured diameter would be 16 cm, and his computed radius would be 8 cm.\n\nThe area of a circle with a radius of 8 cm is $A = \\pi (8)^2 = 64\\pi$ cm$^2$. The actual area of the circle with a radius of 10 cm is $A = \\pi (10)^2 = 100\\pi$ cm$^2$. Therefore, the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is:\n\n$$\\frac{64\\pi - 100\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{-36\\pi}{100\\pi} \\times 100\\% = -36\\%$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent."
