At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of 33 fifth-graders is 11. The average age of 55 of their parents is 33. What is the average age of all of these parents and fifth-graders?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Let's find the total age of the 33 fifth-graders by multiplying the average age by the number of fifth-graders:  \n33 fifth-graders \u00d7 11 years/fifth-grader = 363 years\n\n2. Let's find the total age of the 55 parents by multiplying the average age by the number of parents:  \n55 parents \u00d7 33 years/parent = 1815 years\n\n3. Now, let's find the total age of all the parents and fifth-graders by adding the total ages:  \n363 years + 1815 years = 2178 years\n\n4. Finally, let's find the average age of all the parents and fifth-graders by dividing the total age by the total number of people:  \n2178 years \u00f7 (33 fifth-graders + 55 parents)  \n2178 years \u00f7 88 people  \n\u2248 24.75 years  \n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$24.75$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the ages of the fifth graders is $33 \\cdot 11,$ while the sum of the ages of the parents is $55 \\cdot 33.$ Therefore, the sum of all their ages is \\[33 \\cdot 11 + 55 \\cdot 33 = 33 (11 + 55) = 33 \\cdot 66.\\]Since there are $33 + 55 = 88$ people in total, their average age is \\[\\frac{33 \\cdot 66}{88} = \\frac{33 \\cdot 3}{4} = \\frac{99}{4} = \\boxed{24.75}.\\]"
