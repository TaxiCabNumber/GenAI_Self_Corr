At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose I have 6 shirts, 4 ties, and 3 pairs of pants.  If an outfit requires a shirt and pants, and can either have a tie or not have a tie, how many outfits can I make?",
        "inference": "The number of outfits without a tie is $6\\cdot3=18$. The number of outfits with a tie is $6\\cdot3\\cdot4=72$. Therefore, the total number of outfits is $18+72=\\boxed{90}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 choices of shirt, 3 choices of pants, and 5 choices for either wearing one of the 4 ties or not wearing a tie at all, so the total number of outfits is $6 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{90}$."
