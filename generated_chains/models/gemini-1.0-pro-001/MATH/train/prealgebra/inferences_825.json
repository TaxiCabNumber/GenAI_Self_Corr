At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAdam has $15$ of a certain type of rare coin and is interested in knowing how much this collection is worth.  He discovers that $5$ of these coins are worth $12$ dollars in total. Assuming that the value of each coin is the same, how many dollars is his entire collection worth?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the value of one coin.**\n\nValue of 5 coins = $12\n\nValue of 1 coin = $12 / 5 = $2.40\n\n**Step 2: Find the value of the entire collection.**\n\nValue of 15 coins = 15 * $2.40 = $36\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{$36}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $15=5 \\times 3$, the total value of his collection will be worth $3$ times the amount that the $5$ coins are worth by themselves.  Thus the total value of his coin collection is $12 \\times 3=\\boxed{36}$ dollars."
