At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of the five numbers in a list is 54. The average of the first two numbers is 48. What is the average of the last three numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the five numbers be a, b, c, d, and e.\nThen, we have:\n(a + b + c + d + e) / 5 = 54\n(a + b) / 2 = 48\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 5, we get:\n(a + b) * 5 = 48 * 5\n(a + b) * 5 = 240\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:\n(c + d + e) / 5 = 54 - 240 / 5\n(c + d + e) / 5 = 54 - 48\n(c + d + e) / 5 = 6\n\nTherefore, the average of the last three numbers is 6.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6}.

        "ground_truth": "The sum of all five numbers is $5\\times 54=270$. The sum of the first two numbers is $2\\times 48=96$, so the sum of the last three numbers is $270-96=174$. The average of the last three numbers is $\\frac{174}{3}=\\boxed{58}$."
