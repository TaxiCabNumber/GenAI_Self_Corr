I hope it is correct.'\nIn convex pentagon $ABCDE$, angles $A$, $B$ and $C$ are congruent and angles $D$ and $E$ are congruent. If the measure of angle $A$ is 40 degrees less than the measure of angle $D$, what is the measure of angle $D$?",

We have:\nangle $A$ = $x$\nangle $B$ = $x$\nangle $C$ = $x$\nangle $D$ = $x$ + 40\nangle $E$ = $x$ + 40\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $540$ degrees, so we have:\n$x + x + x + x + 40 + x + 40 = 540$\n$5x + 80 = 540$\n$5x = 460$\n$x = 92$\nTherefore, the measure of angle $D$ is $x$ + 40 = $92$ + 40 = $132$ degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{132}$.
