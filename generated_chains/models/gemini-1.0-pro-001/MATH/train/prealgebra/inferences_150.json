        "inference": "The dealer sold $200$ cars. $15\\%$ were Audis, so she sold $0.15\\cdot 200=30$ Audis. $22\\%$ were Toyotas, so she sold $0.22\\cdot 200=44$ Toyotas. $28\\%$ were Acuras, so she sold $0.28\\cdot 200=56$ Acuras. Altogether, she sold $30+44+56=130$ Audis, Toyotas, and Acuras. Since she sold $200$ cars, the remaining $200-130=\\boxed{70}$ were Hondas.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{70}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The percentage of cars sold that were Hondas is $100-15-22-28=35$ percent. Since there are 200 total cars, $200\\cdot 0.35=\\boxed{70}$ cars are Hondas."
