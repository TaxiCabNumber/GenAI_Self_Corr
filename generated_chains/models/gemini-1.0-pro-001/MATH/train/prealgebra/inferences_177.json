        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe wants to find all the four-letter words that begin and end with the same letter. How many combinations of letters satisfy this property?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of letters available for the first and last letters **(26 letters in the alphabet)**.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of options for the middle two letters **(26 letters in the alphabet)**.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the values from Steps 1 and 2 to find the total number of combinations **(26 * 26 = 676)**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$676$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $26$ choices for the first letter, $26$ for the second, and $26$ for the third. The last letter is determined by the first letter. Thus, there are $26^3 = \\boxed{17576}$ such combinations."
