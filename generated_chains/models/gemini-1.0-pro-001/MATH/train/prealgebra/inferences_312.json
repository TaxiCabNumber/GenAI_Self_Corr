At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn recently bought a used car for $\\$5000$ for his pizza delivery job. He gets $\\$10$ for each pizza he delivers, but he has to spend $\\$3$ on gas for each pizza he delivers. What is the minimum whole number of pizzas John must deliver in order to earn back the money he spent on the car he bought?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of pizzas John delivers. Then, he earns $10n$ dollars from delivering pizzas. However, he also spends $3n$ dollars on gas. Therefore, his net earnings are $10n - 3n = 7n$ dollars. Since he needs to earn back $\\$5000$, we have $7n = 5000$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 5000/7 = \\boxed{714}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{714}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ be the number of pizzas he bought. He makes $10p$ dollars selling $p$ pizzas, but he spends $3p$ dollars on gas. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n10p-3p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7p &\\ge 5000 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge \\frac{5000}{7} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad p &\\ge 714\\frac{2}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, John must sell at least $\\boxed{715}$ pizzas to earn back the $\\$5000$ he spent on the car."
