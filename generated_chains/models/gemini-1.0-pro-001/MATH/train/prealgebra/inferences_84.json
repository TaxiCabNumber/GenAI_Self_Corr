At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a right triangle with integer length sides, the hypotenuse has length 39 units. How many units is the length of the shorter leg?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the length of the shorter leg. Then the length of the longer leg is \\(39-x\\). By the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$x^2+(39-x)^2=39^2$$\n\n$$x^2+1521-78x+x^2=1521$$\n\n$$2x^2-78x=0$$\n\n$$2x(x-39)=0$$\n\n$$x=0\\text{ or }x=39$$\n\nSince \\(x\\) represents the length of a side, it cannot be 0.\n\nTherefore, the length of the shorter leg is \\(\\boxed{39}\\) units.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$39$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since they only ask for one length, you can assume that there's only one possible triangle.  Then, quickly note that $39 = 3\\cdot 13$, and that 5 - 12 - 13 is a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the shorter leg has length $\\boxed{15}$."
