        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nApples are sold at the farmer's market at a rate of $\\$4$ per five pounds. According to this rate, how many dollars does it cost to buy 15 pounds of apples?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nIf 5 pounds cost $4, then 1 pound costs $\\frac{4}{5}$ dollars.\n\nTherefore, 15 pounds cost $15 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 12$ dollars.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have the ratio $5 \\text{ pounds}:\\$4$. Multiplying both sides of the ratio by 3 does not change the ratio. Doing so, we get $15 \\text{ pounds}:\\$12$. Thus, 15 pounds of apples costs $\\boxed{12}$ dollars."
