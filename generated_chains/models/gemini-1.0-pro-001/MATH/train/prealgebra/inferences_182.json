At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the arithmetic mean of the integers from -4 through 5, inclusive? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

Divide the sum by the count to find the arithmetic mean:\n10 / 10 = 1.0\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1.0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 10 integers between $-4$ and 5 inclusive; the sum of these integers is 5, since the sum of the integers between $-4$ and 4 is zero. So the mean is $5/10 = \\boxed{0.5}$."
