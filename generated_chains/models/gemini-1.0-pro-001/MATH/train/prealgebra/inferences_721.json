At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\textrm{A}$ be a digit. If the 7-digit number $353808\\textrm{A}$ is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, then what is $\\textrm{A}$?",
        "inference": "Since the number is divisible by 2, the last digit must be even. Also, since the number is divisible by 5, the last digit must be either 0 or 5. Since the last digit is already 0, it must be the case that $\\textrm{A}=5$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be a 5 or a 0. In addition, for the number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be even. Thus, $\\textrm{A}$ must be $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNote that when $\\textrm{A}=0$, we also have the following:\n\n* The sum of the digits of the number is 27, so the number is divisible by 3 and 9.   * The number formed by the last two digits is 80, which is a multiple of 4, so the number is divisible by 4.\n\n* The number is divisible by 2 and by 3, so it is divisible by 6.\n\n* The number formed by the last three digits is 080, which is a multiple of 8, so the number is divisible by 8."
