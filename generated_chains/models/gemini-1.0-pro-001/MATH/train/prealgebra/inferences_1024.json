        "ground_truth": "We multiply each part of the ratio $1:2:7$ by 20 to make Amanda's part equal 20, and we have \\[1:2:7 = 1\\cdot 20:2\\cdot 20 :7\\cdot 20 = 20:40:140.\\] This means that  Ben's share is $2\\times 20 = 40$ dollars and Carlos's share is $7\\times 20=140$ dollars.  Therefore, the total amount of money shared is $20+40+140=\\boxed{200}$ dollars."
