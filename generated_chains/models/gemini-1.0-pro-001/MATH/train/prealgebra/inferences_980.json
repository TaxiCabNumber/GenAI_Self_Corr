At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $l$ and $w$ be the original length and width of the rectangle, respectively. Then, the new length is $1.2l$ and the new width is $1.1w$.\n\nThe original area of the rectangle is $lw$.\n\nThe new area of the rectangle is $(1.2l)(1.1w) = 1.32lw$.\n\nTherefore, the area is increased by $1.32lw - lw = 0.32lw$.\n\nTo find the percent increase, we divide the increase by the original area and multiply by $100\\%$:\n\n$$\\frac{0.32lw}{lw} \\times 100\\% = \\boxed{32\\%}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{32\\\\%}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$.
