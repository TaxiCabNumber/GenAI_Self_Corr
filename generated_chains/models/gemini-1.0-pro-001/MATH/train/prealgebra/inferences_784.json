        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ has sides of $6$ units, $8$ units, and $10$ units. The width of a rectangle, whose area is equal to the area of the triangle, is $4$ units. What is the perimeter of this rectangle, in units?",
        "inference": "The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} * 6 * 8 = 24$ square units.\n\nSince the rectangle has the same area as the triangle, the length of the rectangle is $24 / 4 = 6$ units.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is $2 * (6 + 4) = 20$ units.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use the Pythagorean Theorem to verify that triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, or we recognize that $(6,8,10)$ is a multiple of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5)$. The area of a right triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ and $h$ are the lengths of the two legs, so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=24$. If the area of the rectangle is $24$ square units and the width is $4$ units, then the length is $\\frac{24}{4}=6$ units. That makes the perimeter $6+6+4+4=\\boxed{20}$ units."
