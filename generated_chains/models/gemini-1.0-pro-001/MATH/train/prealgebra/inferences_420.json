At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 60 have an even number of positive divisors?",
        "inference": "**1.** The positive divisors of an integer n are the set of positive integers that divide n. For example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n**2.** An integer n has an even number of positive divisors if and only if n is a perfect square.\n**3.** The perfect squares less than 60 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.\n**4.** So, there are $\\boxed{7}$ positive integers less than 60 that have an even number of positive divisors.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Perfect squares have an odd number of positive divisors, while all other integers have an even number of positive divisors.\n\nThe perfect squares less than or equal to 60 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. Therefore, of the 59 positive integers less than 60, 7 of them have an odd number of factors, so $59-7=\\boxed{52}$ of them have an even number of factors."
