At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has side lengths of 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
        "inference": "1. First, find the semiperimeter of the triangle: s = (8 + 15 + 17) / 2 = 20.\n2. Then, use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle: Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle.\n3. Substituting the values of s, a, b, and c into Heron's formula, we get: Area = sqrt(20(20-8)(20-15)(20-17)) = 60.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $8^2+15^2=64+225=289=17^2$.  So the triangle is a right triangle with legs $8$ and $15$, and thus its area is\n\n$$\\frac{8(15)}{2}=\\boxed{60}$$"
