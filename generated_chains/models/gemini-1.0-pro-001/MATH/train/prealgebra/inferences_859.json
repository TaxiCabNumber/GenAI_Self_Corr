        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStan drove 300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes. Next, he drove 360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes. What was Stan's average speed in miles per hour for the total trip?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Convert the time to hours.**\n\n300 miles in 5 hours, 20 minutes\n= 300 miles in 5.33 hours (5 hours + 20 minutes / 60 minutes = 5.33 hours)\n\n360 miles in 6 hours, 40 minutes\n= 360 miles in 6.67 hours (6 hours + 40 minutes / 60 minutes = 6.67 hours)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total distance and time.**\n\nTotal distance = 300 miles + 360 miles = 660 miles\nTotal time = 5.33 hours + 6.67 hours = 12 hours\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average speed.**\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n= 660 miles / 12 hours\n= 55 miles per hour\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{55}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as total distance traveled divided by time traveled. In total, Stan drove 660 miles and it took him 12 hours. His average speed was $660/12=600/12+60/12=50+5=\\boxed{55}$ miles per hour."
