At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can a President and a Vice-President be chosen from a group of 5 people (assuming that the President and the Vice-President cannot be the same person)?",

I hope it is correct.",
