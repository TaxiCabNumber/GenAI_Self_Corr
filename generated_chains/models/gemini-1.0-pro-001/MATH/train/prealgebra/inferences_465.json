At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice chose five positive integers and found that their product was even. What is the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen?",
        "inference": "Let the five integers be:\n2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, and e are odd numbers.\n\nThe product of these five numbers is:\n\n2a * 2b * 2c * 2d * 2e = 32 * a * b * c * d * e\n\nSince 32 is even, the product of the five numbers is even only if the product of a, b, c, d, and e is even.\n\nThe maximum number of even integers among a, b, c, d, and e is 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of odd integers Alice could have chosen is:\n\n5 - 2 = 3\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a product to be even, at least one factor must be even (so that the product is divisible by 2). The minimum number of even integers she could have chosen is 1, so the maximum number of odd integers she could have chosen is $\\boxed{4}$."
