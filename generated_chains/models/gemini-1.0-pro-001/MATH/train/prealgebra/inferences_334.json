At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob is visiting Japan and he wants to buy a coffee for $200$ yen. If one U.S. dollar is worth $108$ yen, how much money, in USD to the nearest hundredth, does he have to spend for the coffee? (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
        "inference": "The value of the coffee in USD can be calculated by dividing the price in yen by the exchange rate.\n\n$$USD = \\frac{200\\ yen}{108\\ yen/USD}$$\n\n$$USD = 1.851851852\\ USD$$\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the final answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1.85$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Bob must pay $200$ yen, which we can multiply by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}}$ to obtain the value in U.S. dollars. Carrying out the calculation, we find that Bob must use $200\\ \\text{yen} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}} \\approx \\boxed{1.85\\ \\text{USD}}$ for the coffee."
