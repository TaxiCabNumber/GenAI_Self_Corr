At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven points are marked on the circumference of a circle. How many different chords can be drawn by connecting two of these seven points?",
        "inference": "The number of chords that can be drawn by connecting two of these seven points is equal to the number of combinations of 2 points out of 7 points. The formula for the number of combinations of r items out of n items is:\n\nnCr = n! / r!(n-r)!\n\nSo, the number of chords that can be drawn is:\n\n7C2 = 7! / 2!(7-2)! = 7! / 2!5! = 7 x 6 / 2 = 21\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$21$}.
