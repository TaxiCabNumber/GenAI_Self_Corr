At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn square $ABCD$, point $M$ is the midpoint of side $AB$ and point $N$ is the midpoint of side $BC$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $AMN$ to the area of square $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let each side of the square have length $x$. Then $AM=MB=BN=x/2$. So the area of the triangle is $(x/2)(x/2)/2=x^2/8$. The area of the square is $x\\cdot x= x^2$. The ratio of the two areas is $(x^2/8)/x^2=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
