At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA recipe calls for $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour. If you only make half of the recipe, then how many cups of flour do you need? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "1. Convert the mixed number $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction: $4\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{4\\cdot 2 + 1}{2}=\\frac{8+1}{2}=\\frac{9}{2}$\n\n2. Divide the numerator of the improper fraction by 2 to find half of the recipe: $\\frac{9}{2}\\div 2=\\frac{9}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{9}{4}$\n\n3. Convert the improper fraction $\\frac{9}{4}$ to a mixed number: $\\frac{9}{4}=2\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2\\frac{1}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To make half of the recipe, only half of the $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour are needed. Since half of $4$ is $2$ and half of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{4},$ we find that $\\boxed{2\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups of flour are needed."
