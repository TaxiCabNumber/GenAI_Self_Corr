I hope it is correct.'\nOn an indoor circular track of circumference 50 feet, Joneal starts at point $S$, runs in a counterclockwise direction, and then stops when he has run exactly one mile (5280 feet). On which quarter of the circle, $A$, $B$, $C$ or $D$, did Joneal stop?\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw((-25,0)--(25,0));\ndraw((0,-25)--(0,25));\ndot((20,0));\nlabel(\"$S$\",(20,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(17,17),E);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-17,17),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-17,-17),W);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(17,-17),E);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The circumference of the track is 50 feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, Joneal ran 5280/50 = 105.6 laps around the track. Since 105.6 is not a whole number, Joneal must have stopped at a point that is not on one of the four quarters of the circle.\n\nLet's find the distance that Joneal ran beyond the fourth quarter, $D$. Since Joneal ran 105.6 laps, he ran 105.6 * 50 = 5280 feet. Since the distance from $S$ to $D$ is one-fourth of the circumference of the track, the distance from $S$ to $D$ is 50/4 = 12.5 feet. Therefore, Joneal ran 5280 - 12.5 = 5267.5 feet beyond the fourth quarter, $D$.\n\nSince Joneal ran 5267.5 feet beyond the fourth quarter, $D$, and the circumference of the track is 50 feet, Joneal ran 5267.5/50 = 105.35 laps beyond the fourth quarter, $D$. Therefore, Joneal stopped at a point that is 105.35 laps beyond the fourth quarter, $D$.\n\nSince 105.35 is not a whole number, Joneal stopped at a point that is not on one of the four quarters of the circle.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{Joneal stopped at a point that is not on one of the four quarters of the circle.}}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 5250 is divisible by 50, Joneal is back at point $S$ after running 5250 feet.  For the next 12.5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $A$. For the next 12.5 feet after that, he is on the portion of the track marked $B$.  At this point he has traveled $5250+12.5+12.5=5275$ feet.  After traveling the final 5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $\\boxed{C}$."
