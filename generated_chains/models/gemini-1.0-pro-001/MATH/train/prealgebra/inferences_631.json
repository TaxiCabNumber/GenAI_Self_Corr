Subtract the amount of water used from the amount of water she started with.\n12/6 gallons - 7/6 gallons = 5/6 gallons\n3. The fraction of a gallon she has left is the amount of water she has left divided by the amount of water she started with.\n5/6 gallons / 12/6 gallons = 5/12\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{12}$} I hope it is correct.",
