        "ground_truth": "Note that $144$ is a multiple of $2^4$ and $3^2$ since    $$144 = 16 \\cdot 9 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2.$$Note that $2^5 = 32$ is not a factor of $144$ since dividing $144$ by $32$ gives a remainder of $16$. Similarly, $3^3 = 27$ is not a factor of $144$ since dividing $144$ by $27$ gives a remainder of $9$.\n\nIt follows that $2^4$ is the greatest power of $2$ that is a factor of $144$, and that $3^2$ is the greatest power of $3$ that is a factor of $144$.
