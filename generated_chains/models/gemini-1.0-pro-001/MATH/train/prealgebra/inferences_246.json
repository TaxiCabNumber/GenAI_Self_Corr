        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $1.2n-4.4<5.2$.",

        "ground_truth": "Adding $4.4$ to both sides of the inequality yields $1.2n < 9.6$. Then, dividing both sides by $1.2$ gives $n<8$. The positive integers satisfying this inequality are $n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. Their sum is $\\boxed{28}$."
