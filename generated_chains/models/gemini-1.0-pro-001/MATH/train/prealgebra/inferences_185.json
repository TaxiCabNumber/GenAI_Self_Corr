        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n$24$ lemons are required to make $32$ gallons of lemonade. How many lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of lemons needed. We can set up a proportion:\n\n$$\\frac{24}{32} = \\frac{x}{4}$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$24 * 4 = 32 * x$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$96 = 32x$$\n\nDividing both sides by 32, we get:\n\n$$x = 3$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The proportion of lemons to gallons of lemonade must always remain constant. Thus, $\\frac{24}{32} = \\frac{x}{4}$, where $x$ is the number of lemons required to make $4$ gallons of lemonade. $\\frac{24}{32}$ simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4}$, so we have $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{x}{4}$. Therefore, $x = 3$. So, $\\boxed{3}$ lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade."
