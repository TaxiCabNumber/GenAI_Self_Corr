        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPiravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer. [asy]\n\npair A, B, C;\n\nC=(0,0);\n\nB=(0,1250);\n\nA=(3000,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\n\nlabel(\"A\", A, SE);\n\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\n\nlabel(\"C\", C, SW);\n\nlabel(\"3000 km\", (A+C)/2, S);\n\nlabel(\"3250 km\", (A+B)/2, NE);\n\ndraw((0,125)--(125,125)--(125,0));\n\n[/asy] Determine the distance she travels for her complete trip.",
        "inference": "The distance from $A$ to $B$ is $3250$ km, and the distance from $B$ to $C$ is $3000$ km. The distance from $C$ to $A$ is also $3000$ km. The total distance she travels for her complete trip is $3250 + 3000 + 3000 = 9250$ km.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9250}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip."
