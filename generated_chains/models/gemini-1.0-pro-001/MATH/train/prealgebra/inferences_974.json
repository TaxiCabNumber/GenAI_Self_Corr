At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRosie can make two pies out of nine apples. How many pies can she make out of twenty-seven apples?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of pies she can make from one apple.\n\n> 2 pies / 9 apples = 2/9 pies per apple\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply the number of pies per apple by the total number of apples.\n\n> 2/9 pies per apple * 27 apples = 6 pies\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\frac{27}{9} =3$, Rosie has 3 times the number of apples she needs to make 2 pies.  So, she can make $2\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$ pies."
