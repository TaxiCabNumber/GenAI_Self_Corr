At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is a $\\heartsuit$?",
        "inference": "There are 4 suits, and 1 of them is $\\heartsuit$. Therefore, the probability of the top card being a $\\heartsuit$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{4}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 13 $\\heartsuit$'s and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a $\\heartsuit$ is $\\dfrac{13}{52} = \\boxed{\\dfrac14}$."
