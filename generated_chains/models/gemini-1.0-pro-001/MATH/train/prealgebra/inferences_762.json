At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a positive integer which reads the same forward and backward, like $12321$ or $4884$.\n\nHow many $4$-digit palindromes are there?",
