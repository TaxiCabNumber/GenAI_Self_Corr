At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAcme T-Shirt Company charges a $\\$50$ set-up fee plus $\\$9$ for  each shirt printed. Beta T-shirt Company has no set up fee, but charges $\\$14$ per shirt. What is the minimum number of shirts for which a customer saves money by using Acme?",
