I hope it is correct.'\nMany television screens are rectangles that are measured by the length of their diagonals. The ratio of the horizontal length to the height in a standard television screen is $4:3$. What is the horizontal length (in inches) of a ``27-inch'' television screen?\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,6)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,6)--(0,6)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,6),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"length\",(4,0),S);\nlabel(\"height\",(8,3),E);\nlabel(\"diagonal\",(4,3),NW);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "First, we can find the ratio of the horizontal length to the diagonal length. Since the ratio of the horizontal length to the height is $4:3$, we can write the horizontal length as $4x$ and the height as $3x$, where $x$ is some constant. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n$$(4x)^2+(3x)^2=27^2.$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get\n$$16x^2+9x^2=729$$\n\n$$25x^2=729$$\n\n$$x^2=29.16$$\n\n$$x=\\sqrt{29.16}\\approx5.4.$$\n\nTherefore, the horizontal length is $4x\\approx4(5.4)=\\boxed{21.6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21.6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The height, length, and diagonal are in the ratio $3:4:5$. The length of the diagonal is 27, so the horizontal length is $\\frac{4}{5} (27) = \\boxed{21.6}$ inches."
