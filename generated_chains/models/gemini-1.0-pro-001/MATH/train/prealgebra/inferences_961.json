At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA jar is filled with red, orange and yellow jelly beans.  The probability of randomly selecting a red jelly bean from this jar is $0.2$, and the probability of randomly selecting an orange jelly bean from this jar is $0.5$.  What is the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean from this jar?",
        "inference": "We can find the probability of selecting a yellow jelly bean by subtracting the probabilities of selecting a red or orange jelly bean from 1.\n\n$$P(\\text{yellow}) = 1 - P(\\text{red}) - P(\\text{orange})$$\n\n$$P(\\text{yellow}) = 1 - 0.2 - 0.5 = 0.3$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the probabilities of each of the possibilities must be equal to 1.  This means that the sum of the probability of randomly selecting a red jelly bean, the probability of randomly selecting an orange jelly bean, and the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean is equal to 1.  If we let the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean be $x$, then we have \\begin{align*}0.2+0.5+x&=1\\\\\\Rightarrow0.7+x&=1\\\\\\Rightarrow{x}&=1-0.7\\\\\\Rightarrow{x}&=0.3\\end{align*} Therefore, the probability of randomly selecting a yellow jelly bean from this jar is $\\boxed{0.3}$."
