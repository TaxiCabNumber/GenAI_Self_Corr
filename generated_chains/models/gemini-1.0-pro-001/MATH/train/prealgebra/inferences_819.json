At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular field is half as wide as it is long, and it is completely enclosed by 54 meters of fencing. What is the number of square meters in the area of the field?",
        "inference": "Let **x** be the width in meters.\nThen, the length is 2x meters.\nThe perimeter is 2(length + width) = 2(2x + x) = 6x meters.\nSince the perimeter is 54 meters, we have 6x = 54, so x = 9.\nTherefore, the width is 9 meters and the length is 2(9) = 18 meters.\nThe area is length * width = 18 * 9 = 162 square meters.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{162}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the rectangle's width be $w$, then its length is $2w$.  So its perimeter is $2(w + 2w) = 6w = 54$.  Thus $w = 9$, and the rectangle's area is $9(2\\cdot 9) = \\boxed{162}$ square meters."
