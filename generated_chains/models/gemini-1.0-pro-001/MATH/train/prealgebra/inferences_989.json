At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree measure of an interior angle of a regular pentagon?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides. So, for a pentagon, the sum of the interior angles is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. Since there are 5 equal interior angles, each angle measures 540/5 = 108 degrees\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$108$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Any convex pentagon may be subdivided into three triangles, each with a total angle sum of 180 degrees. Thus, the sum of the interior angles of any convex pentagon is $3 \\times 180 = 540$ degrees. If the pentagon is regular, then each of its five angles will have the same measure of $540 \\div 5 = \\boxed{108\\text{ degrees}}$."
