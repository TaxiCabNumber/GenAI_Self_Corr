        "inference": "The area of the largest square is the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares. The area of each of the smaller squares is 338 / 3 / 2 = 56 square centimeters. Therefore, the area of the largest square is 56 * 2 = \\\\boxed{112}.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{112}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PQ^2+QR^2$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, $PR^2=PQ^2+QR^2$.  Substituting the left-hand side of this equation for the right-hand side, we find that the sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PR^2=2\\cdot PR^2$.  Setting this equal to 338 square centimeters, we find that $PR^2=338/2=\\boxed{169}$ square centimeters."
