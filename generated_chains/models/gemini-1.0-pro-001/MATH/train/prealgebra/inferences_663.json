        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a meeting with $25$ businessmen, twelve businessmen drank coffee, and ten businessmen drank tea.  Five businessmen drank both coffee and tea.  How many businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea?",
        "inference": "- 12 businessmen drank coffee, 10 businessmen drank tea, and 5 businessmen drank both coffee and tea.\n- So, the total number of businessmen who drank either coffee or tea or both is $12+10-5=17$\n- Therefore, $25-17=\\boxed{8}$ businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum $12+10$ counts twice the businessmen who drank both coffee and tea.  Since there are 5 such businessmen, we must subtract 5 from the sum $12+10$ to only count these businessmen once.  Therefore, a total of $12+10-5=17$ businessmen drank either coffee or tea.  So, $25-17=\\boxed{8}$ businessmen drank neither coffee nor tea."
