        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA car travels 192 miles on 6 gallons of gas. How far can it travel on 8 gallons of gas?",
        "inference": "First, find the miles per gallon:\n\n$$\\frac{192 \\ miles}{6 \\ gallons} = 32 \\ miles/gallon$$\n\nThen, multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons:\n\n$$32 \\ miles/gallon * 8 \\ gallons = 256 \\ miles$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{256}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}$ so 8 gallons is $4/3$ as much gas as 6 gallons is. Since the distance that a car can travel is directly proportional to the amount of gas that it has, if a car can travel $192$ miles on 6 gallons of gas, it can travel $192 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=64 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{256}$ miles on 8 gallons of gas."
