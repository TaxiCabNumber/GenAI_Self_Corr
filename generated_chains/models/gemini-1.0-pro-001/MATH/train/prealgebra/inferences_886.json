        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn assortment of 200 pencils is sold through a catalog for $\\$19.90$. Shipping is an additional $\\$6.95$. Including the charges for both the pencils and the shipping, what is the average cost, in cents, for each pencil? Express your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "1. Find the total cost of the pencils and shipping by adding the two costs: $\\$19.90 + $6.95 = $26.85.\n2. Convert the total cost to cents by multiplying by 100: $26.85 x 100 = 2685 cents.\n3. Divide the total cost in cents by the number of pencils to find the average cost per pencil: 2685 cents / 200 pencils = 13.425 cents per pencil.\n4. Round the average cost per pencil to the nearest whole number: 13.425 cents rounded to the nearest whole number is 13 cents.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils. The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils. Thus, the average cost is $\\frac{2685}{200}\\approx\\boxed{13}$ cents."
