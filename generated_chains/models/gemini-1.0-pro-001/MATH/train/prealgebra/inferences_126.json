        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn is thinking of a number. He gives the following 3 clues. ``My number has 125 as a factor. My number is a multiple of 30. My number is between 800 and 2000.'' What is John's number?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** Since John's number is a multiple of 30, it must be a multiple of 3 and 10. Since $125 = 5^3$, the prime factorization of John's number must include at least 3 factors of 5. Thus, the prime factorization of John's number must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonnegative integers and $c \\geq 3$. Since $125 = 5^3$, we must have $c \\geq 3$. Since John's number is a multiple of 3, we must have $b \\geq 1$. Since John's number is between 800 and 2000, we must have $a \\geq 4$. Thus, the prime factorization of John's number is $2^a \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$, where $a \\geq 4$. Since $2^a \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3 = 30 \\cdot 2^{a-1} \\cdot 5^3$, John's number must be a multiple of 30 and $2^{a-1} \\cdot 5^3$. Since $a \\geq 4$, the only possible value of $a$ is 4. Thus, John's number is $30 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 30 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 125 = 3000$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3000}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be John's number. $n$ is a multiple of $125=5^3$ and of $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$, so the prime factorization of $n$ must contain 5 raised to at least the 3rd power, 2 raised to at least the 1st power, and 3 raised to at least the 1st power. Thus, $\\text{LCM}(125, 30)=2\\cdot3\\cdot5^3= 750$. $n$ is then some multiple of 750. Since $n$ is between 800 and 2000, $n=750$ is too small. Thus, we try $n=2 \\cdot 750=1500$. This number could be John's number. Notice that $n=3 \\cdot 750=2250$ is too large. Thus, John's number is $\\boxed{1500}$."
