        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne caterer charges a basic fee of $\\$100$ plus $\\$15$ per person. A second caterer charges a basic fee of $\\$200$ plus $\\$12$ per person. What is the least number of people for which the second caterer is cheaper?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the number of people as $x$.\nFor the first caterer, the cost is $100 + 15x$.\nFor the second caterer, the cost is $200 + 12x$.\nWe need to find the value of $x$ for which the second caterer is cheaper, which means that $200 + 12x < 100 + 15x$.\nSolving this inequality gives:\n$200 - 100 < 15x - 12x$\n$100 < 3x$\n$x > 33.33$\nTherefore, the least number of people for which the second caterer is cheaper is $\\boxed{34}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number of people, the first caterer charges $100+15x$ dollars, while the second charges $200+12x$ dollars.  We want $$100+15x>200+12x.$$ Subtracting $100$ from both sides gives $$15x > 100+12x,$$ then subtracting $12x$ from both sides gives $$3x>100.$$ Finally, dividing both sides by $3$ gives $x=\\frac{100}{3}=33\\frac{1}{3}$, so the smallest number of people is $\\boxed{34}$."
