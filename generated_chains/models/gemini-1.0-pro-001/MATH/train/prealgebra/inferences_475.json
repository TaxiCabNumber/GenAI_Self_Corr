        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four-digit numeral $3AA1$ is divisible by 9. What digit does $A$ represent?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, $3+A+A+1=4+2A$ must be divisible by 9.\n\nThis is only possible if $2A$ is divisible by 9, which means that $A$ must be 3.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$A = 3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The digit sum is $3+A+A+1=2A+4$. Trying different values of $A$ to see what they make the digit sum, we see that no values of $A$ make $2A+4$ divisible by 9 except for $A=7$. We see that $4+2A=18$, so $A=\\boxed{7}$."
