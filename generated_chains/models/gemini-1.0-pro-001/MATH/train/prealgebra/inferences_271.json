At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three integers be $a, b,$ and $c$. We are given that $abc = 7^3$. Since $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, each of them must be a factor of $7^3$. Therefore, $a, b,$ and $c$ must be $1, 7,$ and $49$ (in some order). The sum of the three integers is $1 + 7 + 49 = \\boxed{57}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{57}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$."
