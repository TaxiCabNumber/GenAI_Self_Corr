        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice and Bob are playing the Smallest Positive Integer Game. Alice says, \"My number is 24.\" Bob says, \"What kind of silly smallest number is that? Every prime factor of your number is also a prime factor of my number.\"\n\nWhat is the smallest possible number that Bob could have? (Remember that Bob's number has to be a positive integer!)",
        "inference": "- Both 2 and 3 are prime factors of 24.\n- Bob's number must also have 2 and 3 as prime factors.\n- The smallest possible number with 2 and 3 as prime factors is 6.\n- 6 is the smallest possible number that Bob could have.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $24$ is $2^3\\cdot3$, so $2$ and $3$ have to be prime factors of Bob's number as well. The smallest possible number is when each the exponents of both of them is $1$, giving $2\\cdot3=\\boxed{6}$."
