At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a sale, a store owner reduces the price of a $\\$10$ scarf by $30\\%$. Later the price is lowered again, this time by $50\\%$ of the reduced price. What is the current price, in dollars?",
