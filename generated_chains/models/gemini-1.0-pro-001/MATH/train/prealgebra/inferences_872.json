At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJamie has a jar of coins containing the same number of nickels, dimes and quarters. The total value of the coins in the jar is $\\$$13.20. How many nickels does Jamie have?",
        "inference": "Let's assume Jamie has $x$ nickels, $x$ dimes and $x$ quarters.\n\nThe value of the nickels is $0.05x$.\nThe value of the dimes is $0.10x$.\nThe value of the quarters is $0.25x$.\n\nThe total value of the coins is $0.05x + 0.10x + 0.25x = 13.20$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $0.40x = 13.20$.\nDividing both sides by $0.40$, we get $x = 33$.\n\nTherefore, Jamie has $\\boxed{33}$ nickels.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Writing the problem in cents, and letting the number of each coin be $x$, we have $5x + 10x + 25x = 1320$, or $40x = 1320$. This gives immediately $x =\n\\boxed{33}$."
