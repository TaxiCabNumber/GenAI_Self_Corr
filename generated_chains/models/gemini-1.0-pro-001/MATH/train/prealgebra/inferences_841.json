At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLyndy conducted a survey of the 300 students in her school. She found that 60 students own dogs, while only 30 students own cats. What percent of the students own cats?",
        "inference": "1) Find the total number of students who own pets: 60 + 30 = 90\n2) Find the percentage of students who own cats: (30 / 90) * 100 = 33.33%\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$33.33%$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "30 of the students own cats, and there are 300 students total, which makes for a fraction: $\\frac{30}{300} = \\frac{1}{10} = \\boxed{10\\%}$."
