At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrea notices that the 40-foot tree next to her is casting a 10-foot shadow. How tall, in inches, is Andrea if she is casting a 15-inch shadow at the same time?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the height of the tree be 40 feet and its shadow be 10 feet. Let Andrea's height be x inches and her shadow be 15 inches. Since the ratio of the height to the shadow is the same for both the tree and Andrea, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{40}{10}=\\frac{x}{15}$$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$$x=\\frac{40}{10}\\times15$$\n\n$$x=40\\times1.5$$\n\n$$x=60$$\n\nTherefore, Andrea's height is $\\boxed{60}$ inches.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$60$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\\text{ feet})/(10\\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\\times 15\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{60}$ inches tall."
