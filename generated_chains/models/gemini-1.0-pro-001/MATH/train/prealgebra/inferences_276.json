Since our list of prime numbers has a sum that is divisible by 3, it cannot contain 2.\n\n**Step 3**: The only prime number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 is 3. Since our list of prime numbers has a sum that is divisible by 3, it must contain 3.\n\n**Step 4**: The only prime number that leaves a remainder of -1 when divided by 3 is -3. Since -3 is not a positive number, our list of prime numbers cannot contain -3.\n\n**Step 5**: The only remaining prime numbers are 5 and 7. Our list of prime numbers must contain either 5 and 7 or 5, 7, and 11.\n\n**Step 6**: If our list of prime numbers contains 5 and 7, then the sum of the prime numbers is 5 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 7**: If our list of prime numbers contains 5, 7, and 11, then the sum of the prime numbers is 5 + 7 + 11 = 23, which is not divisible by 3.\n\n**Therefore, the smallest possible value of the sum of four consecutive prime numbers that is divisible by 3 is 12.**\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{12}.
