At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $2\\times 3$ rectangle and a $3\\times 4$ rectangle are contained within a square without overlapping at any interior point, and the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of the two given rectangles. What is the smallest possible area of the square?",

The side length of the square must be greater than the largest side length of the two rectangles, which is 4.\n\n- The smallest square that can cover both rectangles must have a side length of 5.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}.$ I hope it is correct.",
