At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex bakes a total of $24$ pies, and each pie is apple, blueberry, or cherry. The ratio of apple to blueberry to cherry pies is $1:4:3$. How many cherry pies did Alex bake?",
        "inference": "The ratio of apple to blueberry to cherry pies is $1:4:3$.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of apple pies. Then the number of blueberry pies is $4x$ and the number of cherry pies is $3x$.\n\nSince Alex bakes a total of $24$ pies, we have $x+4x+3x=24$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=2$.\n\nTherefore, the number of cherry pies is $3x=3\\cdot2=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $24$ pies are divided into $1+4+3 = 8$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{24}{8} = 3$ pies per part. Since three parts of the pies are cherry, Alex baked $3 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{9}$ cherry pies."
