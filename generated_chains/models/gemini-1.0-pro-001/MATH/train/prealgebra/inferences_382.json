At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty gremlins and fifteen imps are at the Annual Mischief Convention. The imps have had a lot of in-fighting lately and refuse to shake hands with each other, but they readily shake hands with all of the gremlins. Meanwhile, all the gremlins are quite friendly and shake hands with all of the other gremlins as well as imps. Each pair of creatures shakes hands at most once. How many handshakes were at the convention?",
        "inference": "First, we calculate the number of handshakes between the gremlins.  There are 20 gremlins, so there are C(20, 2) = 190 handshakes between them.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of handshakes between the imps and gremlins.  There are 15 imps and 20 gremlins, so there are 15 * 20 = 300 handshakes between them.\n\nFinally, we add up the number of handshakes between the gremlins and the number of handshakes between the imps and gremlins to get the total number of handshakes:\n\n190 + 300 = 490\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{490}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us first count the handshakes between two gremlins. There are $20$ gremlins, so there must be $\\dfrac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} = 190$ handshakes between two gremlins, making sure to divide by two to avoid over-counting.\n\nMeanwhile, there are $15$ imps that shake hands with each of the $20$ gremlins, which makes $15 \\cdot 20 = 300$ handshakes between imps and gremlins.\n\nAdding them up, we have $300 + 190 = \\boxed{490}$ total handshakes."
