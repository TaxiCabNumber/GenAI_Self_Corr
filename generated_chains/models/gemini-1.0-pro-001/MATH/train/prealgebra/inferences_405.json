        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\emph{convex}$ polygon is a polygon in which every interior angle is less than 180 degrees.  A $\\emph{diagonal}$ of a convex polygon is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices.  How many diagonals does a convex polygon with 20 sides have?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Draw the convex polygon and label the vertices with the letters A, B, C, ..., T.\n\n**Step 2**: Count the number of possible diagonals by connecting each vertex to every other vertex that is not adjacent to it.  For example, from vertex A, we can draw diagonals to vertices B, C, D, ..., T. \n\n**Step 3**: Note that each diagonal is counted twice using this method (e.g. the diagonal from A to B is counted when we consider A as the starting vertex and when we consider B as the starting vertex).\n\n**Step 4**: To find the total number of diagonals, divide the count from step 2 by 2.\n\n**Step 5**: Since there are 20 vertices, we can draw 20(19)/2 = 190 diagonals.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{190}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For each of the 20 vertices of the polygon, there are 17 other nonadjacent vertices that we can connect the original vertex with to form a diagonal.  However, multiplying 20 by 17 would count each diagonal twice---once for each of the diagonal's endpoints. We must divide the result by 2 to correct for this, so the answer is $(20\\cdot 17)/2=\\boxed{170}$."
