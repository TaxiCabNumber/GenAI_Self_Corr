At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $3$ is a factor of $a$, $a$ is a divisor of $12$, and $a$ is positive. What is the number of possible values of $a$?",
        "inference": "Since $3$ is a factor of $a$, then $a=3k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\nSince $a$ is a divisor of $12$, then $12=an$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\nSubstituting $a=3k$ into the second equation, we get $12=3kn$.\nDividing both sides of the equation by $3$, we get $4=kn$.\nSince $k$ and $n$ are positive integers, the only possible values of $k$ and $n$ are $k=1$ and $n=4$, or $k=2$ and $n=2$.\nTherefore, the only possible values of $a$ are $a=3$ and $a=6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
