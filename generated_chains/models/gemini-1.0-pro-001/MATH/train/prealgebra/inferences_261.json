Then, divide 200 by 15 to get the number of multiples of 15 between 1 and 200, which is $\\frac{200}{15} = 13$. \n\nNext, find the number of integers between 1 and 200 that are multiples of either 4 or 7. To do this, find the LCM of 4 and 7, which is 28.

The only multiples of 7 we need to be concerned with are those ending in 5 or 0.  The only number on the list that is a multiple of 7 is 105.  Our final list is: $$15,30,45,75,90,135,150,165,195$$ This leaves us with $\\boxed{9}$ integers."
