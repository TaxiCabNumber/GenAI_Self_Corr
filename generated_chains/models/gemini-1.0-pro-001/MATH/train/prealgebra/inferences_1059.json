In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of different colors?\n\nSolution:\n\nThere are $10$ socks in total.  I need to choose $2$ socks of different colors.\n\nFor the first sock, I can choose $4$ white, $4$ brown, or $2$ blue socks.  So I have $4+4+2=10$ choices for the first sock.\n\nFor the second sock, I need to choose a sock of a different color than the first sock.  If I choose a white sock first, I can choose $4$ brown or $2$ blue socks for the second sock.  If I choose a brown sock first, I can choose $4$ white or $2$ blue socks for the second sock.  If I choose a blue sock first, I can choose $4$ white or $4$ brown socks for the second sock.  So I have $4+2+4+2+4+4=16$ choices for the second sock.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of different colors is $10\\times 16=\\boxed{160}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{160}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the socks are different, either white and brown, brown and blue, or white and blue can be picked.  If the socks are white and brown, there are 4 options for the white sock and 4 options for the brown sock for a total of 16 choices.  If the socks are brown and blue, there are 4 options for the brown sock and 2 options for the blue sock for a total of 8 choices.  If the socks are white and blue, there are 4 options for the white sock and 2 options for the brown sock for a total of 8 choices.  This gives a total of $16 + 8 + 8 = \\boxed{32}$ choices."
