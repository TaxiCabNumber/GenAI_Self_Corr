At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo students are having a pie eating contest. The first student eats $\\frac{6}{7}$ of one pie. The second student eats $\\frac{3}{4}$ of one pie. How much more pie did the first student finish than the second student? Express your answer as a fraction of one pie, reduced to simplest form.",
