At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "To count the number of zeros at the end of $25\\times240$, we must count the number of products $2\\times5$. We prime factorize the product by combining the prime factorizations of 25 and 240: $25\\times240=(5^2)(2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5)=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5^3$. We take the minimum of the powers of 2 and 5 to find that $25\\times240$ has $\\boxed{3}$ terminal zeros."
