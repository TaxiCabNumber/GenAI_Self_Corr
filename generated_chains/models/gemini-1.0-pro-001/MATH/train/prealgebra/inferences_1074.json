I hope it is correct.'\nA new train goes $20\\%$ farther than an older train in the same amount of time. During the time it takes the older train to go 200 miles, how many miles can the newer train complete?",
        "inference": "Let x be the speed of the older train. Then, the speed of the newer train is 1.2 *x. \n\nThe time taken by the older train to go 200 miles is 200/x. \n\nThe distance covered by the newer train in the same time is (1.2x) * (200/x) = 240 miles.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$240$}.
