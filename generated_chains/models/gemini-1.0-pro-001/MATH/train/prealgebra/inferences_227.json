        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of a circle is $49\\pi$ square units. What is the radius of the circle, in units?",
        "inference": "Area of a circle = $\\pi r^2$\nGiven, $49\\pi$ = $\\pi r^2$\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get\n$49 = r^2$\nTaking square root on both sides, we have\n$r = 7$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of a circle is $\\pi \\cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot r^2 = 49\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\\boxed{7}$ units."
