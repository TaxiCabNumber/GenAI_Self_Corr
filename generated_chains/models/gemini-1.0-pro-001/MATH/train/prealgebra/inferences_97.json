        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn surveyed a group of people about their knowledge of rats. To the nearest tenth of a percent, he found that $86.8\\%$ of the people surveyed thought rats carried diseases. Of the people who thought rats carried diseases, $45.7\\%$ said that rats frequently carried rabies. Since rats do not frequently carry rabies, these 21 people were mistaken. How many total people did John survey?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of people who knew that rats carried diseases.\n\nThen, 0.868x = x, so x = 100.\n\nOf these 100 people, 0.457x = 45.7.\n\nSince 21 people were mistaken, 45.7 - 21 = 24.7 people correctly said that rats frequently carried rabies.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people surveyed is 100.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The problem tells us that $45.7 \\% $ of the people who think rats carry diseases equates to $21$ people total. If the total number of people who think that rats carry diseases is $x$, then we solve for $x$ as follows: $0.457x = 21$, so $x = 45.95$. However, we know that $x$ must be an integer, so rounding up, we get $x=46.$ Now, these $46$ people represent $86.8 \\%$ of the total number of people surveyed. So, if we let $y$ be the total number of people surveyed, we can solve for $y$ as follows: $0.868y = 46$, so $y = 52.995$. Rounding up, we get that John surveyed $\\boxed{53}$ total people."
