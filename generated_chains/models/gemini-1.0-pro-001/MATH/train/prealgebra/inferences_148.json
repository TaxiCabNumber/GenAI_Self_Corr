        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMing and Catherine walked to the store together to buy some pencils.  Ming bought $40$ pencils and Catherine bought $24$.  If each package of pencils sold at the store contain the same number of pencils, what is the largest possible number of pencils in a package?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 40 and 24. The prime factorization of 40 is $2^3 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3 \\cdot 3$. The GCF of 40 and 24 is $2^3 = 8$.\nTherefore, the largest possible number of pencils in a package is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the number of pencils in a package must be a divisor of both $24$ and $40$, the largest possible number of pencils in a package is the GCD of $40$ and $24$.  Factoring, $24 = 2^3\\cdot 3$ and $40 = 2^3\\cdot 5$.  The only prime common to both factorizations is $2$, raised the $3$rd power, so the GCD is $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$."
