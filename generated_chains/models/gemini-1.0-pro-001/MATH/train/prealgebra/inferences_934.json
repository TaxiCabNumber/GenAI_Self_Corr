At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 4 representatives from each of 4 companies at a convention. At the start of the convention, every person shakes hands once with every person except the other representatives from their company. How many handshakes are there?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are 4 representatives from each of 4 companies. So, there are a total of 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 people at the convention.\n\nEach person shakes hands with every other person except the other representatives from their company. So, each person shakes hands with 16 - 4 = 12 people.\n\nSince every handshake involves two people, we need to divide by 2 to get the number of handshakes.\n\nNumber of handshakes = 12 \u00d7 16 / 2 = 96\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{96}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "All 16 people shake hands with 12 other people (everyone except themselves and the other representatives from their company).  In multiplying $16 \\times 12$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\\dfrac{16 \\times 12}{2} = \\boxed{96}$ handshakes."
