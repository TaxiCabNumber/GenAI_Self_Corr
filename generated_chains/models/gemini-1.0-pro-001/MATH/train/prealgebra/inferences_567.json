It takes Bob $\\frac{2}{5}$ of that amount of time to clean his room. How many minutes does it take Bob to clean his room?",

Find the fraction of time it takes Bob to clean his room: $\\frac{2}{5}$\n\n3. Multiply Alice's time by the fraction of time it takes Bob: $\\frac{25}{60} \\times \\frac{2}{5}$\n\n4. Simplify the expression: $\\frac{25}{60} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{1}{12}$\n\n5.

Since multiplication is commutative, we have: \\[\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25 = \\frac{25}{5} \\times 2\\]A fraction is another way to represent division, so $\\frac{25}{5} = 25\\div5 = 5$, and $5\\times2 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes."
