At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat three-digit number with units digit 2 and hundreds digit 4 is divisible by 9?",
        "inference": "Since the number is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.\nLet the tens digit be $x$. Then, we have:\n\n$$4+x+2 = 9k$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 9k - 6$$\n\nSince $x$ is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. Thus, we have:\n\n$$0 \\le 9k - 6 \\le 9$$\n\n$$6 \\le 9k \\le 15$$\n\n$$0.666\\ldots \\le k \\le 1.666\\ldots$$\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, the only possible value is $k = 1$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$x = 9k - 6 = 9(1) - 6 = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the number is $432$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{432}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+4=6$, the only digit that will make the sum of the digits of the three-digit number divisible by 9 is $3$. Therefore, the three-digit number is $\\boxed{432}$."
