        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of butter:flour:sugar in a recipe is 1:6:4. When using 8 cups of sugar in this recipe, how many total cups of these three ingredients will be used?",
        "inference": "Let's find the ratio of sugar to the total ingredients.\n\nRatio of sugar = 4 / (1 + 6 + 4) = 4 / 11\n\nWhen using 8 cups of sugar, the total ingredients will be:\n\n8 cups / (4 / 11) = 8 * 11 / 4 = 22 cups\n\n**Final Answer: $\\\\boxed{22}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have that in every recipe, there is 1 part butter to 6 parts flour to 4 parts sugar. That is identical to saying that there are $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ parts butter to $2 \\cdot 6 = 12$ parts flour to $2 \\cdot 4 = 8$ parts sugar. If each part is a cup, then there must be 12 cups flour and 2 cups butter used. In total, there are $12+2+8=\\boxed{22}$ total cups of ingredients used."
