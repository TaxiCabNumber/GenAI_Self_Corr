At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct three-digit numbers can be written with the digits $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$ if no digit may be used more than once in a three-digit number?",

Therefore, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ distinct three-digit numbers that can be written with the digits $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$ if no digit may be used more than once in a three-digit number.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}.$ I hope it is correct.",
