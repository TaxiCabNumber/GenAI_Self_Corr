At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of white balls and red balls in a jar is in the ratio of $3:2$. If there are 9 white balls, how many red balls are there?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let the number of red balls be x.\n\n**Step 2:** Therefore, the ratio of white balls to red balls is: $9:x$.\n\n**Step 3:** Given the ratio is $3:2$. So, we can write: $\\frac{9}{x}=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\n**Step 4:** Cross-multiplication gives: $2 \\times 9 = 3 \\times x$.\n\n**Step 5:** Simplification gives: $18 = 3x$.\n\n**Step 6:** Division by 3 gives: $x = \\frac{18}{3}$.\n\n**Step 7:** Solving gives: $x = 6$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For every 3 white balls in the jar, there are 2 red balls in the jar. Since there are 9 white balls in the jar, which is 3 groups of 3 white balls, there must be 3 groups of 2 red balls in the jar. Thus, there are $3\\times2 =\\boxed{6}$ red balls in the jar."
