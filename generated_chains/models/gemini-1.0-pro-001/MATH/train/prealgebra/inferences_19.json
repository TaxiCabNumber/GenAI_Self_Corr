At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix positive integers from a list of nine positive integers are $6, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5$. What is the largest possible value of the median of this list of nine positive integers?",
        "inference": "1. The median of six positive integers $6, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5$ is $6$.\n2. The median of any list of $2n + 1$ positive integers is between the $n$-th and the $(n + 1)$-th smallest numbers in the list.\n3. The largest possible value of the median of a list of nine positive integers is 8.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we sort the numbers, we get $2,4,5,6,7,8$. If we want to maximize the median, we should add three numbers larger than 8. This makes the median $\\boxed{7}$."
