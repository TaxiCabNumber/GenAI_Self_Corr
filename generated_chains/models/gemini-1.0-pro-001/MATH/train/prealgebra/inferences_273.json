At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pizza parlor has six different toppings. How many different one- and two-topping pizzas can you order?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n**One-topping pizzas:**\n\nThere are 6 choices for the topping.\n\n**Two-topping pizzas:**\n\nFor the first topping, there are 6 choices.\nFor the second topping, there are 5 choices (since it cannot be the same as the first topping).\n\n**Total two-topping pizzas:** 6 * 5 = 30\n\n**Total one- and two-topping pizzas:** 6 (one-topping pizzas) + 30 (two-topping pizzas) = 36\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{36}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Obviously, there are $6$ one-topping pizzas.\n\nNow we count the two-topping pizzas. There are $6$ options for the first topping and $5$ options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $6\\cdot5=30$ options. However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means there are really only $\\dfrac{6\\cdot5}{2}=15$ two-topping pizzas.\n\nAdding our answers, we see that there are $6+15=\\boxed{21}$ possible pizzas with one or two toppings."
