        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the smallest two-digit prime number such that reversing the digits of the number produces a composite number.",
        "inference": "The smallest two-digit prime number is $\\boxed{13}.$ Reversing its digits, we get $\\boxed{31},$ which is a prime number. The next smallest two-digit prime number is $\\boxed{17}.$ Reversing its digits, we get $\\boxed{71},$ which is a composite number.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by listing the two-digit primes with 1 as the tens digit:\n\n11, 13, 17, 19.\n\nWhen reversed, the above numbers are 11, 31, 71, and 91.  The first three are prime, but 91 is composite (7 times 13), as desired.  Hence, our desired prime is $\\boxed{19}$."
