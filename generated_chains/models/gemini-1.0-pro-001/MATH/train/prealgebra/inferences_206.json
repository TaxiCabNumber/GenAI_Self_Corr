At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a particular square and the circumference of a particular circle are equal. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "Let s be the sidelength of the square and r be the radius of the circle. We have:\n$$4s=\\pi r$$\nThe area of the square is $A_s=s^2$, and the area of the circle is $A_c=\\pi r^2$. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is:\n$$\\frac{A_s}{A_c}=\\frac{s^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{4s^2}{4\\pi r^2}=\\frac{(4s)^2}{4\\pi r^2}=\\frac{\\pi^2 r^2}{4\\pi r^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$}.
