At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes?  (Note: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards as backwards.)",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nFirst, we list all the two-digit palindromes: $11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99$.\n\nNext, we find the prime factorizations of each of these numbers:\n\n$11 = 11$\n$22 = 2 \\cdot 11$\n$33 = 3 \\cdot 11$\n$44 = 2^2 \\cdot 11$\n$55 = 5 \\cdot 11$\n$66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$\n$77 = 7 \\cdot 11$\n$88 = 2^3 \\cdot 11$\n$99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$\n\nFinally, we find the greatest common factor of all of these prime factorizations. The greatest common factor is $11$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Palindromes are numbers whose digits read from left to right and from right to left result in the same number. All two-digit palindromes (11, 22,...99) can be factored into 11 and a number between 1 and 9. The only factor that all of them share is $\\boxed{11}$, so that is our answer."
