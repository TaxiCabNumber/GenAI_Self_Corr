At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour concentric circles are drawn with radii of 1, 3, 5 and 7. The inner circle is painted black, the ring around it is white, the next ring is black and the outer ring is white. What is the ratio of the black area to the white area? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
