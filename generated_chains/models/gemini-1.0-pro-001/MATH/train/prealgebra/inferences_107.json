        "ground_truth": "Call the radius of the outer circle $r_1$ and that of the inner circle $r_2$. The width of the track is $r_1-r_2$. The circumference of a circle is $2\\pi$ times the radius, so the difference in circumferences is $2\\pi r_1-2\\pi r_2=10\\pi$ feet. If we divide each side by $2\\pi$, we get $r_1-r_2=\\boxed{5}$ feet."
