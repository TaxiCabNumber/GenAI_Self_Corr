        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $1000^{100}$ is expanded out, the result is $1$ followed by how many zeros?",
        "inference": "We first determine the number of factors of 10 in $1000^{100}$ and then multiply this number by two.  Because $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, the number of factors of 10 in $1000^{100}$ is equal to the sum of the number of factors of 2 and the number of factors of 5.\n\nNow $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$, and so $1000^{100} = (2^3 \\cdot 5^3)^{100} = 2^{300} \\cdot 5^{300}$.\n\nTherefore, $1000^{100}$ has $300$ factors of 2 and $300$ factors of 5, and so it has $300 + 300 = 600$ factors of 10.  Multiplying this number by two gives $600 \\cdot 2 = 1200$ zeros.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1200}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Remember, $10^n$ is $1$ followed by n zeros.  Now, in order to count the zeros, we must express $1000^{100}$ in the form of $10^n$.  Notice that $1000 = 10^3$, so $1000^{100} = (10^3)^{100} = 10^{300}$, by the power of a power rule.  Now, it is obvious that $1000^{100}$ is $1$ followed by $\\boxed{300}$ zeros."
