        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe hypotenuse of a right triangle measures $6\\sqrt{2}$ inches and one angle is $45^{\\circ}$. What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is half the product of the lengths of its legs. Since the hypotenuse of the triangle is $6\\sqrt{2}$ inches, and one of the angles is $45^{\\circ}$, the lengths of the legs are equal and are both $\\frac{6\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}=6$ inches. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 6 = 18$ square inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\\circ$, then the other is $90^\\circ-45^\\circ =45^\\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle.  The hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has 6.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(6)(6)/2 = \\boxed{18}$."
