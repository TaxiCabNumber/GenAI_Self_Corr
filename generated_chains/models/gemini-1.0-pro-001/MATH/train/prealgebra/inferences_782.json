At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe mean of the set of numbers $\\{87,85,80,83,84,x\\}$ is 83.5. What is the median of the set of six numbers? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "1. Find the sum of the given numbers: $87+85+80+83+84+x = 519+x$.\n2. Since the mean is 83.5, the sum of the numbers is $83.5 \\times 6 = 501$.\n3. Therefore, $519+x = 501$, which gives $x = -18$.\n4. The set of numbers is $\\{87,85,80,83,84,-18\\}$.\n5. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order: $-18, 80, 83, 84, 85, 87$.\n6. The median is 83.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$83$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If six numbers have a mean of 83.5, then the sum of the numbers is $6 \\times 83.5$, which is 501. The five known numbers have a sum of 419, so the value of $x$ must be $501 - 419 = 82$. To find the median of our six numbers, we arrange them in order from least to greatest as follows: 80, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87. The median is the average of 83 and 84, which is, coincidentally, $\\boxed{83.5}$."
