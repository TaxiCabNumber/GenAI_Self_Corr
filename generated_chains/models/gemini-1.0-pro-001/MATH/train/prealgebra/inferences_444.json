        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve students in Mrs. Stephenson's class have brown eyes. Twenty students in the class have a lunch box. Of Mrs. Stephenson's 30 students, what is the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box?",

It says that twelve students have brown eyes, and twenty students have a lunch box.\n\nSo, the least number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box is twelve.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $20$ students have a lunch box, $10$ students do not have a lunch box.  So at most $10$ students with brown eyes do not have a lunch box, and at least $\\boxed{2}$ students with brown eyes must have a lunch box."
