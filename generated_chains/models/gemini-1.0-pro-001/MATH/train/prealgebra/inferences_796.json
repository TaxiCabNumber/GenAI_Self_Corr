I hope it is correct.'\nThe circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",
        "inference": "The circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the area of the circle is $154 \\pi$ square inches, we have the equation \\begin{align*}\n\\pi r^2 &= 154\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad r^2 &= \\frac{154}{\\pi} = \\frac{154 \\cdot 7}{22} = 51.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $r = \\sqrt{51} = 7$ inches.
