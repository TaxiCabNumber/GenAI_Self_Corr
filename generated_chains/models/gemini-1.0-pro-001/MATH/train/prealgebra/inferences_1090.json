At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRoberto has four pairs of trousers, seven shirts, and three jackets. How many different outfits can he put together if an outfit consists of a pair of trousers, a shirt, and a jacket?",
        "inference": "First, let's find the number of different outfits Roberto can put together with his trousers. He has four pairs of trousers, so he can choose one in four different ways. Next, let's find the number of different outfits Roberto can put together with his shirts. He has seven shirts, so he can choose one in seven different ways. Finally, let's find the number of different outfits Roberto can put together with his jackets. He has three jackets, so he can choose one in three different ways. To find the total number of different outfits Roberto can put together, we need to multiply the number of different ways he can choose each item. So, the total number of different outfits Roberto can put together is $4 \\times 7 \\times 3 = 84$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $4\\times 7\\times 3=\\boxed{84}$ ways to make three decisions if the numbers of options available for the decisions are 4, 7, and 3."
