        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=5$, $BC=6$, and $AC=7$. Two bugs start simultaneously from $A$ and crawl along the perimeter of the triangle in opposite directions at the same speed. They meet at point $D$. What is $BD$?",
        "inference": "Since the bugs start simultaneously and move at the same speed, they cover the same distance by the time they meet. Therefore, $AB + BD = BC + CD$. We know that $AB = 5$, $BC = 6$, and $AC = CD + BD$. Thus, $5 + BD = 6 + CD$. Substituting $AC = CD + BD$ into this equation, we get $5 + BD = 6 + (7 - BD)$. Solving for $BD$, we get $2BD = 8$, so $BD = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of the triangle is $5+6+7=18$, so the distance that each bug crawls is 9.  Therefore $AB+BD=9$, and $BD=\\boxed{4}$."
