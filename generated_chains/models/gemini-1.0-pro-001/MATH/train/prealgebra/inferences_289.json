        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Beaumont High School, there are 12 players on the baseball team.  All 12 players are taking at least one of biology or chemistry.  If 7 players are taking biology and 2 players are taking both sciences, how many players are taking chemistry?",
        "inference": "There are 12 players on the team.\n7 players are taking biology.\n2 players are taking both biology and chemistry.\n\nSo, 12 - 7 = 5 players are taking only biology.\nAnd, 2 players are taking both biology and chemistry.\n\nSo, 5 + 2 = 7 players are taking chemistry.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "7 players are taking biology, so $12 - 7 = 5$ players are not taking biology, which means 5 players are taking chemistry alone.  Since 2 are taking both, there are $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$ players taking chemistry."
