        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest multiple of $9$ whose negation is greater than $-100$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** To find the largest multiple of 9 whose negation is greater than -100, we first need to find the smallest negative multiple of 9. This is -9, since -9 is the smallest negative number that is divisible by 9.\n\n**Step 2:** The negation of a number is the number with the opposite sign. So, the negation of -9 is 9.\n\n**Step 3:** We want to find the largest multiple of 9 that is greater than 9. The largest multiple of 9 that is greater than 9 is 81, since 81 is the largest number that is divisible by 9 and is greater than 9.\n\nTherefore, the largest multiple of 9 whose negation is greater than -100 is 81.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$81$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing $-100$ by $9$ gives $-11$ with a remainder of $-1$. In other words, $$-100 = -11 \\cdot 9 + (-1).$$This means that $-11 \\cdot 9 = -99$ is greater than $-100$. Because the negation of $99$ is $-99$, $\\boxed{99}$ is the largest multiple of $9$ whose negation is greater than $-100$.\n\nWe could also divide $-100$ by $9$ to get $-12$ with a positive remainder of $11$. However, $-12 \\cdot 9$ is less than $-100$, so $$-100 = -12 \\cdot 9 + 11$$would not help."
