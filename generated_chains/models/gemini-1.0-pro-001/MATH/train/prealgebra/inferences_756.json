At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fair 6-sided die is rolled.  What is the probability that the number rolled is a divisor of 6?",
        "inference": "The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThe probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6.\nThe probability of rolling a 2 is 1/6.\nThe probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6.\nThe probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a divisor of 6 is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
