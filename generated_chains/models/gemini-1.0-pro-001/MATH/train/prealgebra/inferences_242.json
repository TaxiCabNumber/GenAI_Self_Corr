Therefore, the median is $40$.\n\n2. **Find the mode.** The mode is the value that occurs most often in a data set. In this case, the value $22$ occurs three times, which is more than any other value. Therefore, the mode is $22$.\n\n3. **Find the positive difference between the median and the mode.** The positive difference between the median and the mode is $40-22 = 18$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
