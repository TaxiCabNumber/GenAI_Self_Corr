At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJeff's five assignment scores are 89, 92, 88, 95 and 91. What is the arithmetic mean of these five scores?",
        "inference": "1. Add all the scores together: 89 + 92 + 88 + 95 + 91 = 455.\n2. Divide the sum by the number of scores: 455 \u00f7 5 = 91.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{91}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The mean of five real numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 5.  Therefore, Jeff's average score is $(89+92+88+95+91)/5=\\boxed{91}$."
