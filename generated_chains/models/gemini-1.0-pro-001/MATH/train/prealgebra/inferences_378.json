        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand on a standard clock when it indicates $9$:$40$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves $\\frac{360}{12}=30$ degrees each hour.  In 40 minutes, the hour hand moves an additional $\\frac{30}{60}=5$ degrees.  So, the hour hand has moved a total of $30+5=35$ degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees each minute.  In 40 minutes, the minute hand has moved $40\\times6=240$ degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe acute angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand is the difference between the measures of the angles that the two hands have moved from the 12 o'clock position.  So, the acute angle measures $240-35=\\boxed{205}$ degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$205$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is $40/60=2/3$ of the way from the 9 to the 10 on the clock, which the minute hand is on the 8. Between any two numbers on the clock there are $360/12=30$ degrees. Thus, the angle between the two hands is $30+30(2/3)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
