At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 40-foot by 10-foot rectangular garden is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same amount of fencing, its shape is changed to a square. How many square feet larger than the old garden is the new garden?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden.\nPerimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(40 + 10) = 2(50) = 100 feet\n\n**Step 2:** Since the perimeter of the square garden will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangular garden, we can find the side length of the square.\nSide length = Perimeter / 4 = 100 / 4 = 25 feet\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the area of the rectangular garden.\nArea = length x width = 40 x 10 = 400 square feet\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the area of the square garden.\nArea = side length^2 = 25^2 = 625 square feet\n\n**Step 5:** Find the difference between the areas of the square and rectangular gardens.\nArea increase = Area of square garden - Area of rectangular garden = 625 - 400 = 225 square feet\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{225}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The original garden has an area of $40\\cdot 10=400\\text{ ft}^2$. Its perimeter is $40+10+40+10=100\\text{ ft}$, so a square fence using the same amount of fencing has sides of length $25\\text{ ft}$ and an area of $25\\cdot 25 = 625\\text{ ft}^2$. The increase in area is thus $625 - 400 = \\boxed{225}$ square feet."
