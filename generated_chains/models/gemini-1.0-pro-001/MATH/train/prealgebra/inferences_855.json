At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has legs measuring 20 inches and 21 inches. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in inches?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nStep 1:\n\nUse the Pythagorean theorem: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 2:\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\n$20^2 + 21^2 = c^2$\n\nStep 3:\n\nEvaluate the squares:\n\n$400 + 441 = c^2$\n\nStep 4:\n\nSimplify:\n\n$841 = c^2$\n\nStep 5:\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\n$c = \\sqrt{841}$\n\nStep 6:\n\nSimplify further:\n\n$c = 29$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Say the hypotenuse has length $h$ inches. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $h^2=20^2+21^2=400+441=841$, so $h=\\sqrt{841}=29$. The length is thus $\\boxed{29}$ inches."
