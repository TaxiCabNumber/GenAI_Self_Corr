At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf I have four boxes arranged in a $2$ x $2$ grid, in how many distinct ways can I place the digits $1$, $2$, and $3$ in the boxes such that each box contains at most one digit?  (I only have one of each digit, so one box will remain blank.)",
        "inference": "There are $3$ choices to fill the box in the first row and first column; $2$ choices to fill the box in the first row and second column (since it must not be the same as the box in the first row and first column); $1$ choice to fill the box in the second row and first column (since it must not be the same as the box in the first row and first column or the box in the first row and second column); and $1$ choice for the last box (since it must not be the same as the other three boxes).\n$$3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 6$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can think of placing a $0$ in the fourth box that will necessarily be empty. Now the problem is simple: we have four choices of digits for the first box, three for the second, two for the third, and one for the last. Thus, there are $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ distinct ways to fill the boxes."
