At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers between $100$ and $150$ have three different digits in increasing order? One such integer is $129$.",
        "inference": "There are $9$ choices for the smallest digit (since it cannot be $0$), $8$ choices for the middle digit, and $7$ choices for the largest digit.  So, the total number of such integers is $9\\times8\\times7=504$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$504$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will break up the problem into cases based on the second digit and count the number of integers in each case. If the second digit is 0, there are no integers because the first digit (1) is larger than the second. Similarly, if the second digit is 1, there are no integers. If the second digit is 2, there are 7 integers (with third digit from 3 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 3, there are 6 integers (with third digit from 4 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 4, there are 5 integers (with third digit from 5 to 9, inclusive). Among all the cases, there are $7+6+5=\\boxed{18}$ integers."
