At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarty wants to paint a box.  He can choose to use either blue, green, yellow, or black paint.  Also, he can style the paint by painting with a brush, a roller, or a sponge.  How many different combinations of color and painting method can Marty choose?",
