At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the interior angles of a particular triangle are in a 5:6:7 ratio. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle?",
        "inference": "Let the measures of the interior angles be $5x, 6x$, and $7x$.\nThen, $5x + 6x + 7x = 180^\\circ$.\n$\\Rightarrow 18x = 180^\\circ$.\n$\\Rightarrow x = 10^\\circ$.\nTherefore, the smallest interior angle is $5x = 5(10) = 50^\\circ$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Choose $k$ so that the smallest angle measures $5k$ degrees.  Then the measures of the other two angles are $6k$ degrees and $7k$ degrees.  Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\\implies 18k=180\\implies k=10$.  The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
