        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diagonals of a rhombus are $10$ inches and $24$ inches. What is the perimeter of the rhombus, in inches?",
        "inference": "Let the rhombus be ABCD.\nLet the diagonals intersect at O.\nLet $AO = 5$ inches and $CO = 12$ inches.\nThen, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AC^2 = AO^2 + CO^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 169$.\nTherefore, $AC = 13$ inches.\nSince the perimeter of the rhombus is $4 \\times AC$, the perimeter is $4 \\times 13 = 52$ inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, so therefore the side length of the rhombus can be calculated as $\\sqrt{5^2+12^2} = 13$. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4 \\times 13 = \\boxed{52}$ inches."
