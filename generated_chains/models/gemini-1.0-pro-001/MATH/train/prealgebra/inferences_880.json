At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA club has 15 members and needs to choose 2 members to be co-presidents.  In how many ways can the club choose its co-presidents?",
        "inference": "To choose 2 co-presidents from a club of 15 members, we can use combinations.\n\n**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways to choose the first co-president.\n\nThere are 15 members to choose from, so there are 15 options.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of ways to choose the second co-president after the first has been chosen.\n\nSince we can't choose the same member twice, there are 14 members left to choose from.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of ways to choose each position.\n\n15 (ways to choose the first co-president) x 14 (ways to choose the second co-president) = 210\n\n**Final Answer: ${210}. I hope it is correct.$**",
        "ground_truth": "If the co-president positions are unique, there are 15 choices for the first president and 14 choices for the second president.  However, since the positions are identical, we must divide by $2$, since $15\\cdot 14$ counts each possible pair of co-presidents twice, once for each order in which they are selected.  This gives us $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14}{2} = \\boxed{105}$ ways to choose the co-presidents."
