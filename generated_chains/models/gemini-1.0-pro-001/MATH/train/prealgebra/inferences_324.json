At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive couples were at a party. If each person shook hands exactly once with everyone else except his/her spouse, how many handshakes were exchanged? (Note: One obviously doesn't shake hands with oneself.)",
        "inference": "**Solution of the last problem**\n1. Each person shakes hands with 9 others (5 couples + 4 others).\n2. 5 people do this, so there are 5 * 9 = 45 handshakes.\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of 10 people at the party.  Each shakes hands with everyone else, except for their spouse, which will be a total of $10-2=8$ other people.  The total number of handshakes will be $10\\cdot8/2=\\boxed{40}$, where we divide by 2 to correct for counting each handshake twice."
