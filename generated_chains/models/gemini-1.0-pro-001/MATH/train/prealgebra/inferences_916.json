At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn SHORT BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 distinct numbers from the set $1-10$ in the first column, 5 distinct numbers from $11-20$ in the second column, 4 distinct numbers $21-30$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 distinct numbers from $31-40$ in the fourth column and 5 distinct numbers from $41-50$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible SHORT BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$21$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$22$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$24$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$25$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$40$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$39$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$38$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$37$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$36$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$41$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$42$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$43$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$44$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$45$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play SHORT BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.  A player wins when he marks 5 in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nHow many distinct possibilities are there for the values in the first column of a SHORT BINGO card? (The placement on the card matters, so the order of the numbers matters, so $5~4~3~2~1$ is to be considered different from $1~2~3~4~5$, for instance.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIn the first column, there are 5 squares, and there are 10 numbers to choose from for each square. Thus there are $10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6=10!$ possibilities.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10!}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 10 choices for the top number.  That leaves 9 for the second number.  Once those are chosen, there are 8 possibilities for the third number, then 7 for the fourth and 6 for the fifth.  That gives a total of  \\[10\\times9\\times 8 \\times 7\\times 6 = \\boxed{30240}\\] possible first columns."
