        "ground_truth": "$32=2^5$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The only prime number these two have in common is 2. If a number contains a factor of 2 greater than $2^4$, then it cannot be a factor of 48. However, $2^4$ is a factor of both numbers. Thus, the greatest common factor of 32 and 48 is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$."
