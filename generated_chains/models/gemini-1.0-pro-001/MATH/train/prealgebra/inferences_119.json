At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn athlete's heart beats an average of 150 times per minute while running. How many times does the athlete's heart beat during a 26-mile race if the athlete runs at a pace of 5 minutes per mile?",
        "inference": "- The athlete runs 26 miles.\n- Each mile takes 5 minutes.\n- So, the athlete runs for 26 * 5 = 130 minutes.\n- During 1 minute, the athlete's heart beats 150 times.\n- So, during 130 minutes, the athlete's heart beats 150 * 130 = 19500 times.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$19500$}. I hope it is correct.",
