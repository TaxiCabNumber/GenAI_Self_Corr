        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the 50 students in the drama club, 36 take mathematics, 27 take physics and 20 students take both mathematics and physics. How many drama club students take neither mathematics nor physics?",
        "inference": "Let m be the number of drama club students who take mathematics and p be the number who take physics. We know that 36 students take mathematics, 27 students take physics, and 20 students take both. So, we can write the following system of equations:\n\nm = 36\np = 27\nm + p - 20 = 50\n\nSolving for m and p, we get:\n\nm = 36\np = 27\n\nSubstituting these values into the third equation, we get:\n\n36 + 27 - 20 = 50\n43 = 50\n\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution to the system of equations. Therefore, there are no drama club students who take neither mathematics nor physics.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the 36 taking math, there are 20 taking both math and physics, so there are $36-20= 16$ students taking only math.  Similarly, there are $27-20= 7$ taking only physics.  There are 50 students total, 16 in just math, 7 in just physics, and 20 in both math and physics, so there are  $50-16-7-20= \\boxed{7}$ students taking neither."
