At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?",

        "ground_truth": "Because $4 > \\sqrt{x} > 3$, we know that $16 > x > 9$.  Thus, the integers from 10 to 15 inclusive satisfy this inequality, which means $\\boxed{6}$ integers satisfy the condition in the problem."
