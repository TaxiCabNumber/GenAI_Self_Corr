At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn triangle $ABC$, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $86$ degrees. The measure of $\\angle B$ is $22$ degrees more than three times the measure of $\\angle C$. What is the measure, in degrees, of $\\angle C$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the measure of $\\angle C$.\nThen, we have:\n$$\\angle B=3x+22$$\nSince the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n$$\\angle A+\\angle B+\\angle C=180$$\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n$$86+(3x+22)+x=180$$\nCombining like terms, we get:\n$$4x+108=180$$\nSubtracting 108 from both sides, we get:\n$$4x=72$$\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n$$\\boxed{x=18}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In a triangle, the degrees of the three angles add up to $180$. We set the degree measure for $\\angle C$ to be $x$. Therefore, the angle measure for $\\angle B$ is $3x+22$. We add all of the degrees together to $180$. Then we have: \\begin{align*}\n86+3x+22+x &= 180 \\\\\n108+4x &= 180 \\\\\n4x &= 72 \\\\\nx &= 18.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have that the degree measure of $\\angle C$ is $\\boxed{18 \\text{ degrees}}$."
