At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow much greater, in square inches, is the area of a circle of radius 20 inches than a circle of diameter 20 inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
