At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRobin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other?",
        "inference": "1. There are 4 choices for the bottom scoop.\n2. There are 3 choices for the second scoop.\n3. There are 2 choices for the third scoop.\n4. There is 1 choice for the top scoop.\n5. So, the total number of orders is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four choices for the bottom scoop. Once this decision is made, there are only 3 choices for the scoop above that.  Similarly there are 2 choices for the third scoop, and the final scoop is uniquely determined.  In total, there are $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = \\boxed{24}$ orders."
