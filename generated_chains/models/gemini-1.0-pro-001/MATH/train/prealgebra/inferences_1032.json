        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Chemistry class, Samantha finds that she can make a certain solution by mixing $.04$ liters of chemical A with $.02$ liters of water (this gives her $.06$ liters of the solution). She wants to make a total of $.48$ liters of this new solution.  To do so, how many liters of water will she use?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the ratio of water to solution.**\n\nIn the original solution, the ratio of water to solution is 0.02 / 0.06 = 1 / 3.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of water needed for 0.48 liters of solution.**\n\nTo make 0.48 liters of solution, Samantha will need 0.48 * 1 / 3 = 0.16 liters of water.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$0.16$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that $\\frac{.02}{.06}=\\frac{1}{3}$ is the fraction of water in the solution.  Thus, since Samantha wants $.48$ total liters of the solution, we have that she must use $.48 \\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{0.16}$ liters of water."
