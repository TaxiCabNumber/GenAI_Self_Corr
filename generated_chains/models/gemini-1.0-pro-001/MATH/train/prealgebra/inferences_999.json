At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $15\\%$ of $N$ is $45\\%$ of 2003, what is the value of $N$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the percentages to their decimal equivalents:\n$15\\% = 0.15$ and $45\\% = 0.45$.\n\n**Step 2:** Write the equation based on the problem statement:\n$0.15N = 0.45(2003)$\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for N by dividing both sides by 0.15:\n$N = \\frac{0.45(2003)}{0.15}$\n\n**Step 4:** Evaluate the expression:\n$N = \\frac{901.35}{0.15} = 6009$.\n\n**Final Answer: $$N=\\boxed{6009}$$**",
        "ground_truth": "Multiply both sides of the equation \\[\n\\frac{15}{100}N=\\frac{45}{100}(2003)\n\\] by 20 to find that $3N=9(2003)$.  Divide both sides by 3 to obtain $N=3(2003)=\\boxed{6009}$."
