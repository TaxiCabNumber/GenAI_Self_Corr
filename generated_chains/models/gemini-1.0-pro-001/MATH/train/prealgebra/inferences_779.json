At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMalcolm can run a race at a speed of 6 minutes per mile, while Joshua runs at 8 minutes per mile. In a 10-mile race, how many minutes after Malcolm crosses the finish line will Joshua cross the finish line if they start the race together?",
        "inference": "Malcolm's speed is 1 mile in 6 minutes, so he covers 10 miles in 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.\n\nJoshua's speed is 1 mile in 8 minutes, so he covers 10 miles in 8 * 10 = 80 minutes.\n\nJoshua will cross the finish line 80 - 60 = 20 minutes after Malcolm.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$20$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Malcolm will take $6 \\cdot 10 = 60$ minutes to finish the race, and Joshua will take $8 \\cdot 10 = 80$ minutes to finish the race. Thus, Joshua will cross the finish line $80 - 60 = \\boxed{20}$ minutes after Malcolm."
