        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAngie's class has 2 girls for every 3 boys. If there are 20 students in the class, how many girls are in Angie's class?",
        "inference": "There are 2 girls for every 3 boys. That means that if we add the number of boys and the number of girls, the total will be 3 + 2 = 5.  If there are 20 students in the class, the number of groups of 5 will be 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, the number of girls will be 4 * 2 = 8.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $2k$ is the number of girls in Angie's class, then $3k$ is the number of boys.  The total number of students is $2k+3k=5k$.  Solving $5k=20$ gives $k=4$, so there are $2(4)=\\boxed{8}$ girls in Angie's class."
