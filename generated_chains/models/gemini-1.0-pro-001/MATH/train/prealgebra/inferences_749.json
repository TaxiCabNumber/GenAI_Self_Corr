At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 5-digit number $52\\,28\\square$ is a multiple of 6.  Which digit is represented by $\\square$?",

The last digit of $52\\,28\\square$ must be even.  The only even digit that can be placed in the blank is $2$.\n4. A number is divisible by $3$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$.  The sum of the digits of $52\\,282$ is $17$.  $17$ is not divisible by $3$, so we need to add a digit to the blank that will make the sum of the digits divisible by $3$.
