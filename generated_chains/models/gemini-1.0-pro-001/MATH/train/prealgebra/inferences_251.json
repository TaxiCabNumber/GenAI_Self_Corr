        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer $x$ such that $\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{4}{5} < \\frac{5}{3}$?",
        "inference": "$$\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{4}{5} < \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\n$$5(x+4) < 15$$\n\n$$x+4 < 3$$\n\n$$x < -1$$\n\n$$x=\\boxed{-2}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by multiplying both sides of the inequality by $15$, so as to get rid of denominators: $$15\\cdot \\frac{x}{3} + 15\\cdot \\frac{4}{5} < 15\\cdot\\frac{5}{3},$$which simplifies to $$5x + 12 < 25.$$Subtracting $12$ from both sides gives $5x<13$, then dividing both sides by $5$ gives $x<2\\frac35$. The largest integer $x$ satisfying this inequality is $\\boxed{2}$."
