At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPaint is to be mixed so that the ratio of red paint to white paint is 3 to 2. If Ben wants to make 30 cans of the mixture and all cans hold the same volume of paint, how many cans of red paint will he need?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the total number of parts in the ratio: 3 + 2 = 5 parts\n2. Determine the number of parts that represent the red paint: 3 parts\n3. Calculate the fraction of the total mixture that is red paint: 3/5\n4. Multiply the fraction by the total number of cans: 3/5 * 30 cans = 18 cans\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $3/(3+2)=3/5$ of the total amount of paint is red, he will need $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot30=\\boxed{18}$ cans of red paint."
