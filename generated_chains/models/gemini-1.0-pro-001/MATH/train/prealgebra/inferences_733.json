At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is 4 meters, the radius is $r = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$ meters. Therefore, the area of the circle is\n\n$$A = \\pi (2)^2 = \\pi (4) = 4\\pi \\text{ square meters}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters."
