        "inference": "We can form a rectangle by connecting four dots in two different ways:\n\n1. Two dots on the same side and the opposite two dots on the opposite side. There are 4 choices for the first dot, and then 3 choices for the second dot on the same side, and then 2 choices for each of the other two dots on the opposite side. So, there are $4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 2 = 48$ rectangles of this type.\n\n2. Two dots on different sides and the other two dots on the same side of the opposite corner. There are 4 choices for the first dot, and then 3 choices for the second dot on a different side, and then 2 choices for each of the other two dots on the same side of the opposite corner. So, there are $4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 2 = 48$ rectangles of this type.\n\nSo, the total number of different rectangles is $48 + 48 = 96$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{96}$. I hope it is correct.",
