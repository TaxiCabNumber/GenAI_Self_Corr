At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJenny places a total of 18 red Easter eggs in several green baskets and a total of 24 orange Easter eggs in some blue baskets.  Each basket contains the same number of eggs and there are at least 4 eggs in each basket.  How many eggs did Jenny put in each basket?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the number of eggs in each basket by x.\nFor the green baskets with red eggs: 18/x = integer\nFor the blue baskets with orange eggs: 24/x = integer\nSince x must be a factor of both 18 and 24, we can find the common factors:\nFactors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\nFactors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\nCommon factors: 1, 2, 3, 6\nSince x must be greater than or equal to 4, the possible values for x are 6 or 3.\nIf x = 6, then there are 3 green baskets with 6 red eggs each and 4 blue baskets with 6 orange eggs each.\nIf x = 3, then there are 6 green baskets with 3 red eggs each and 8 blue baskets with 3 orange eggs each.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{6 or 3}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number of eggs in each basket is a common divisor of 18 and 24 that is at least 4.  The common divisors of 18 and 24 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ eggs in each basket."
