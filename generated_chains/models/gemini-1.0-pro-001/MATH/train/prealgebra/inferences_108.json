At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of irises to roses in Nikki's garden is 2:5. She currently has 25 roses. She is planning to add 20 more roses and enough irises to keep the same ratio. How many irises will she have in total after this addition?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the ratio of irises to roses.**\n\nThe ratio of irises to roses is 2:5.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of irises Nikki currently has.**\n\nTo find the number of irises Nikki currently has, we need to use the ratio of irises to roses. We know that the ratio is 2:5, and she has 25 roses. So, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n```\n2/5 = x/25\n```\n\nwhere x is the number of irises Nikki currently has.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 2/5 * 25 = 10\n```\n\nSo, Nikki currently has 10 irises.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of irises Nikki will have after adding 20 more roses.**\n\nTo find the number of irises Nikki will have after adding 20 more roses, we need to use the same ratio of irises to roses. We know that the ratio is 2:5, and she will have 25 + 20 = 45 roses after adding 20 more. So, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n```\n2/5 = x/45\n```\n\nwhere x is the number of irises Nikki will have after adding 20 more roses.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 2/5 * 45 = 18\n```\n\nSo, Nikki will have 18 irises after adding 20 more roses.\n\n**Step 4: Find the total number of irises Nikki will have after adding 20 more roses.**\n\nTo find the total number of irises Nikki will have after adding 20 more roses, we need to add the number of irises she currently has to the number of irises she will have after adding 20 more roses. So, we have:\n\n```\nTotal number of irises = Current number of irises + Number of irises after adding 20 more roses\n```\n\nSubstituting the values we found in steps 2 and 3, we get:\n\n```\nTotal number of irises = 10 + 18 = 28\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$28$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "After adding 20 roses, Nikki will have $25+20=45$ roses.  If she will have 2 irises for every 5 roses, then she will have $2(9)=\\boxed{18}$ irises."
