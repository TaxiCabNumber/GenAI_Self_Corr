At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different two-person sub-committees can be selected from a committee of six people (the order of choosing the people does not matter)?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe number of different two-person sub-committees can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\n$$C(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$\n\nwhere:\n* n is the total number of people (6 in this case)\n* r is the number of people to select (2 in this case)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$C(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6!}{2!4!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 options for the first person and 5 options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $6\\cdot5=30$ options. However, the order in which we choose the two members of the committee doesn't matter, so we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{6\\cdot5}{2}=\\boxed{15}$ combinations."
