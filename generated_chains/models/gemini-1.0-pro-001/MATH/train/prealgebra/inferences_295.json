I hope it is correct.'\nTo be eligible for an algebra class a student must have an average of at least $83\\%$ over all four quarters in his or her pre-algebra class. If Fisher had an $82\\%$, $77\\%$, and $75\\%$ in the first three quarters, what is the minimum score he must earn in the 4th quarter to move on to algebra?",

Then, the average score over all four quarters is:\n\n(82% + 77% + 75% + x) / 4 = 83%\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n(82 + 77 + 75 + x) / 4 = 83\n82 + 77 + 75 + x = 83 * 4\n82 + 77 + 75 + x = 332\nx = 332 - 82 - 77 - 75\nx = 98\n\nTherefore, Fisher must earn a score of at least 98% in the 4th quarter to move on to algebra.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{98}$.
