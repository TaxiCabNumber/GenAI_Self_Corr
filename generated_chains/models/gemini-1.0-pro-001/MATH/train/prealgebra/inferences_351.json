At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven three members of a group -- Alice, Bob, and Carol -- in how many ways can these three be chosen to be the three officers (president, secretary, and treasurer) of the group, assuming no person holds more than one job?",
        "inference": "There are three possible choices for president. For each choice of president, there are two choices for secretary. For each choice of president and secretary, there is one remaining person who must be the treasurer. So the total number of ways to choose the officers is\n$$3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1=6.$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In this problem we are choosing a committee, so the order in which we choose the 3 people does not matter.  We could have chosen them in any of the following orders (where A is Alice, B is Bob, and C is Carol): ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.  So each possible committee corresponds to $3! = \\boxed{6}$ possible orderings."
