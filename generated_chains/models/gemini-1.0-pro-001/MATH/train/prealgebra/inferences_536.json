I hope it is correct.'\nA bookstore has a sale on days of the month that are multiples of 5 (such as June 5, June 10...). A shoe store has a sale every 6 days. The shoe store has a sale on July 3. How many times in July do the two stores have sales on the same date?",

The bookstore will have sales on July 10, July 15, July 20, July 25, and July 30. The two stores will have sales on the same date on July 15 and again on July 30.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}.
