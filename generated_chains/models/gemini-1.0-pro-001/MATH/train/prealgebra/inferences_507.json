At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of girls to boys in Ms. Snow's math class is 3:2. If there is a total of 45 students, how many girls are in Ms. Snow's math class?",
        "inference": "Let the number of girls be 3x and the number of boys be 2x, where x is a constant.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total number of students is 45. Therefore, we can write:\n3x + 2x = 45\n5x = 45\nx = 45/5\nx = 9\n\nNow, we can find the number of girls:\nNumber of girls = 3x = 3 * 9 = 27\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $3k$ girls in Ms. Snow's class, then there are $2k$ boys.  Since the total number of students is $45$, we solve $2k+3k=45$ to find $k=45/5=9$.   There are $3k=3(9)=\\boxed{27}$ girls in the class."
