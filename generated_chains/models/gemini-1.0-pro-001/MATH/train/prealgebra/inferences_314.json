At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nApartment rentals in Fairview run $\\$$0.90 per square foot. Jillian has determined that she can afford $\\$$630 per month for rent. What is the largest apartment, in square feet, she should consider at the given rate?",
        "inference": "1. Let the size of the apartment, in square feet, be $x$.\n2. The cost of renting the apartment is $0.90x$ dollars per month.\n3. We are given that the cost of renting the apartment cannot exceed $630 per month.\n4. Therefore, we can write the inequality $0.90x \\le 630$.\n5. Solving the inequality, we get $x \\le 700$.\n6. Therefore, the largest apartment, in square feet, that Jillian should consider at the given rate is 700 square feet.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$700$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the size of the apartment be $s$.  The cost will be $0.9s$.  The maximum comes when this is $630$, so\n\n$$630=0.9s\\Rightarrow s=\\boxed{700}$$\n\nsquare feet."
