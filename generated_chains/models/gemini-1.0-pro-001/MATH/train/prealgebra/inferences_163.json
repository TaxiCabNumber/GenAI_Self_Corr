        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least four-digit positive integer, with all different digits, that is divisible by each of its digits?",
        "inference": "**1) Find All Possible Combinations:**\n\nThere are 9 possible digits for the first digit (1-9) and 8 for the second (excluding the first digit). So, there are 9 * 8 = 72 possible combinations for the first two digits.\n\n**2) Check Divisibility:**\n\nFor each combination, check if the number is divisible by each of its digits. If it is, proceed to the next step. If not, discard it.\n\n**3) Find the Smallest Four-Digit Number:**\n\nAmong the remaining combinations, find the smallest four-digit number that meets the divisibility criteria.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe only combination that satisfies all criteria is:\n\n- 1224 (divisible by 1, 2, 4)\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit positive integer, with all different digits, that is divisible by each of its digits is:\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1224}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the problem asks for the least possible number, you should start with the lowest number ($0$) and work your way up (and across the number.) Nothing is divisible by zero, so zero cannot be one of the digits in the four-digit number. Every whole number is divisible by $1$, so the digit $1$ should be in the thousands place to create the smallest number. The digits must be different, so put a $2$ in the hundreds place. Now, you have to make sure the number is even. You can put a $3$ in the tens place, but you cannot use $4$ for the ones place since $1234$ is not divisible by $3$ or $4$. $1235$ is not even, so it is not divisible by $2$ (or for that matter, by $3$). $\\boxed{1236}$ is divisible by all of its own digits."
