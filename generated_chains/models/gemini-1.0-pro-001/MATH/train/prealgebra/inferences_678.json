        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA number $x$ is equal to $7\\cdot24\\cdot48$. What is the smallest positive integer $y$ such that the product $xy$ is a perfect cube?",
        "inference": "The smallest perfect cube greater than $7\\cdot24\\cdot48$ is $10^3=1000$. So $y$ must be a multiple of $10$.\nThe next larger multiple of $10$ is $10\\cdot10=100$. So $y$ must be a multiple of $100$.\nThe next larger multiple of $100$ is $100\\cdot10=1000$. So $y$ must be a multiple of $1000$.\n\nSince $y$ is the smallest multiple of $1000$ such that $xy$ is a perfect cube, $y=\\boxed{1000}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Begin by factoring $24$ and $48$. We have $24=2^3\\cdot3$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$, so $$7\\cdot24\\cdot48=7\\cdot(2^3\\cdot3)\\cdot(2^4\\cdot3)=2^7\\cdot3^2\\cdot7.$$For a number to be a perfect cube, every prime factor must have an exponent that is a multiple of $3$. The next multiple of $3$ bigger than $7$ is $9$, so we need a $2^2$ to reach $9$ in the exponent. We need one more factor of $3$ to reach $3^3$. We need another $7^2$ to reach $3$ in the exponent of $7$. This gives a smallest number of $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot7^2=\\boxed{588}$."
