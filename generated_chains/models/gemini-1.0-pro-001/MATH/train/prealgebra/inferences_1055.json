At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe diagonals of a rhombus measure 18 feet and 12 feet. What is the perimeter of the rhombus? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles.  Each right triangle has legs that are half the lengths of the diagonals. So, the legs of the right triangle are 9 feet and 6 feet.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse of each right triangle is $\\sqrt{9^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{81+36}=\\sqrt{117}$ feet.  The perimeter of the rhombus is 4 times the length of the hypotenuse of each right triangle, so the perimeter is $4\\cdot\\sqrt{117}$ feet.  \n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{117}}$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at a 90-degree angle, partitioning the rhombus into four congruent right triangles. The legs of  one of the triangles are 6 feet and 9 feet, so the hypotenuse of the triangle - which is also the side of the rhombus - is $\\sqrt{(6^2 + 9^2)} = \\sqrt{(36 + 81)} = \\sqrt{117}$ feet. Since $117 = 9 \\times 13$, we can simplify this as follows: $\\sqrt{117} = \\sqrt{(9 \\times 13)} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{13} = 3\\sqrt{13}$ feet. The perimeter of the rhombus is four times this amount or $4 \\times 3\\sqrt{13} = \\boxed{12\\sqrt{13}\\text{ feet}}$."
