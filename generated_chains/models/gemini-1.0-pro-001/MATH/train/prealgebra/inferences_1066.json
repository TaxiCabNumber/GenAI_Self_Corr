At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area of the gray region, in square units, if the radius of the larger circle is four times the radius of the smaller circle and the diameter of the smaller circle is 2 units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.

        "ground_truth": "If the diameter of the small circle is 2, then the radius is 1. Thus, the radius of the large circle is 4 times this, or 4. The area of the large circle is then $\\pi4^2=16\\pi$ and the area of the small circle is $\\pi 1^2=1\\pi$. We can then find the gray area to be the difference in these, or $16\\pi-1\\pi=\\boxed{15\\pi} \\text{sq units}$."
