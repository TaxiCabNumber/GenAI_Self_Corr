At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBrand X soda advertises, ``We will give you 20$\\%$ more soda than Brand Y for a total price that is 10$\\%$ less than Brand Y's price!'' What is the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to the unit price of Brand Y soda? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of ounces in a bottle of Brand Y soda. Then the number of ounces in a bottle of Brand X soda is $1.2x$.\nLet $y$ be the price of a bottle of Brand Y soda. Then the price of a bottle of Brand X soda is $0.9y$.\nThe unit price of Brand X soda is $\\frac{0.9y}{1.2x} = \\frac{3y}{4x}$.\nThe unit price of Brand Y soda is $\\frac{y}{x}$.\nTherefore, the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to the unit price of Brand Y soda is $\\frac{3y}{4x} \\div \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{3y}{4x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{y} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda. Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.\n\nIt follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$. The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\\dfrac{p}{v}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$"
