At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGrandma gave Bryce and Carter some raisins. Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, and Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce received. How many raisins did Bryce receive?",
        "inference": "Let's start by letting 'x' represent the number of raisins Carter received.\n\nSince Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, we can represent the number of raisins Bryce received as 'x + 6'.\n\nAccording to the problem, Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce received. So, we can write the equation:\n\nx = (x + 6) / 2\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n2x = x + 6\n\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, Carter received 6 raisins.\n\nSince Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, he received:\n\n6 + 6 = 12 raisins.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of raisins Bryce received be $x$. Since Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, Carter received $x-6$ raisins. Since Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce did, Carter also received $x/2$ raisins. We have two ways of expressing the number of raisins Carter received, so we have the equation $x-6=x/2$, or $x=12$. Thus, Bryce received $\\boxed{12}$ raisins."
