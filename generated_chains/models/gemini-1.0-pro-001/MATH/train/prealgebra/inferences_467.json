At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangular playground exceeds twice its width by 25 feet, and the perimeter of the playground is 650 feet. What is the area of the playground in square feet?",
        "inference": "Let x be the width of the rectangular playground, in feet. Then the length of the playground is 2x + 25 feet. The perimeter of the playground is $2(x) + 2(2x + 25) = 4x + 50$ feet. Since the perimeter is 650 feet, we have $4x + 50 = 650$. Solving for x, we get $x = 150$. Therefore, the width of the playground is 150 feet and the length is $2(150) + 25 = 325$ feet. The area of the playground is $150 \\times 325 = 48750$ square feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48750}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the width of the rectangular playground is $w$, then the length is $2w + 25$. A perimeter of 650 feet means the semi-perimeter is 325 feet. The width plus the length equals the semi-perimeter, so $w + 2w + 25 = 325$. That means $3w = 300$, so $w = 100$ feet. The length must be $2 \\times 100 + 25 =\n225$. The area of the playground is $100 \\times 225 = \\boxed{22,500}$ square feet."
