        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA basement has a 24-foot by 32-foot rectangular floor. The basement is flooded with water to a depth of 18 inches. Three pumps are used to pump the water out of the basement.  Each  pump will pump 8 gallons of water per minute.  If a cubic foot of water contains 7.5 gallons, how many minutes will it take  to pump all of the water out of the basement using the three  pumps?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Convert the dimensions of the basement to feet.**\n\n* 24 feet = 2 feet\n* 32 feet = 3.2 feet\n\n**Step 2: Find the volume of the water in the basement.**\n\n* Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n* Volume = 2 feet \u00d7 3.2 feet \u00d7 1.5 feet\n* Volume = 9.6 cubic feet\n\n**Step 3: Convert the volume of water to gallons.**\n\n* 1 cubic foot = 7.5 gallons\n* 9.6 cubic feet = 9.6 \u00d7 7.5 gallons\n* 9.6 cubic feet = 72 gallons\n\n**Step 4: Find the total pumping rate of the three pumps.**\n\n* 1 pump = 8 gallons per minute\n* 3 pumps = 3 \u00d7 8 gallons per minute\n* 3 pumps = 24 gallons per minute\n\n**Step 5: Find the time it will take to pump all of the water out of the basement.**\n\n* Time = Volume / Pumping rate\n* Time = 72 gallons / 24 gallons per minute\n* Time = 3 hours\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3 hours}.

        "ground_truth": "The height of the water initially in feet is $$(18 \\text{ inches})/(12 \\text{ inches/foot})=1.5\\text{ feet}.$$ The amount of water in the basement initially is $$1.5\\cdot24\\cdot32=1152\\text{ cubic feet}.$$ Converting this to gallons, we have $$(1152 \\text{ ft}^3)\\cdot(7.5 \\text { gallons/ft}^3)=8640 \\text{ gallons}.$$ If each pump can pump out 8 gallons of water per minute, then three pumps can pump out $8\\cdot3=24$ gallons a minute.
