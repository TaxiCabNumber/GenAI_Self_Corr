        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the numbers $\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$, which number is the arithmetic mean of the other two?",
        "inference": "Let's call the three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ where $a=\\frac{7}{10}, b=\\frac{4}{5}$ and $c=\\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe arithmetic mean of two numbers is the average of the two numbers. So, the arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$ is $\\frac{a+b}{2}$.\nThe arithmetic mean of $a$ and $b$ is also $c$.\nTherefore, we have $\\frac{a+b}{2}=c$.\nSubstituting the values of $a, b$ and $c$, we get $\\frac{\\frac{7}{10}+\\frac{4}{5}}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}$.\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we get $\\frac{\\frac{21}{10}+\\frac{8}{10}}{2}=\\frac{3}{4}$.\nSimplifying further, we get $\\frac{29}{20}=\\frac{3}{4}$.\nCross-multiplying, we get $29\\times4=20\\times3$.\nSimplifying, we get $116=60$.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The arithmetic mean must be between the other two numbers, so we find the middle quantity by putting the fractions in a comparable form. We have $\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{8}{10}, \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{7.5}{10}$. The middle quantity is $\\frac{7.5}{10}$, so the arithmetic mean is $\\boxed{\\frac34}$. Our answer makes sense since $7.5$ is the arithmetic mean of $7$ and $8$."
