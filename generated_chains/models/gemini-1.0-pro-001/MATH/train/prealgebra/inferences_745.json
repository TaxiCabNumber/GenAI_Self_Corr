        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe number of diagonals in a convex $n$-gon is $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.  \nSo, for a decagon ($n = 10$), the number of diagonals is $\\frac{10(10-3)}{2} = \\frac{10(7)}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{35}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "A convex $n$-gon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ diagonals. Thus, a convex decagon has $\\frac{10\\cdot 7}{2} = \\boxed{35}$ diagonals."
