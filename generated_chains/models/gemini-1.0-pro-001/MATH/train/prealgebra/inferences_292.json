At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA floor 9 feet by 12 feet, is to be tiled with 4-inch-by-6-inch tiles. How many tiles are needed to cover the floor?",
        "inference": "Area of the floor = 9 * 12 = 108 square feet\nArea of one tile = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8 square feet\nNumber of tiles needed = 108 / (1/8) = 864\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{864}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Notice how 4 inches = 1/3 foot and 6 inches = 1/2 foot, so both the width and length will be tiled with full tiles (i.e. no tiles have to be broken).  Since all tiles remain whole, we can calculate the number of tiles by dividing the total floor area by each tile's area.  Doing so yields \\[\\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{4 \\text{ inches} \\cdot 6 \\text{ inches}} = \\frac{9 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 12\\text{ ft}}{1/3 \\text{ ft} \\cdot 1/2 \\text{ ft}} = \\boxed{648}.\\]Hence, we need $\\boxed{648}$ tiles to cover the floor."
