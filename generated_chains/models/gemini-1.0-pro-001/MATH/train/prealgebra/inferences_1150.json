At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the 60 students in the drama club, 36 take mathematics, 27 take physics and 20 students take both mathematics and physics. How many drama club students take neither mathematics nor physics?",

Then:\n\nn(M) = 36\nn(P) = 27\nn(M\u2229P) = 20\n\nWe want to find n(M'\u2229P') where M' and P' are the complements of sets M and P, respectively.\n\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\nn(M'\u2229P') = n(U) - n(M) - n(P) + n(M\u2229P)\n\nwhere U is the universal set of all 60 drama club students.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nn(M'\u2229P') = 60 - 36 - 27 + 20\nn(M'\u2229P') = 27\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct.",
