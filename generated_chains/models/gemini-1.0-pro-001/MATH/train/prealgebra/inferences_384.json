        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a spelling bee $50\\%$ of the students were eliminated after the first round. Only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining students were still in the contest after the second round. If 24 students were still in the contest after the second round, how many students began the contest?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** After the first round, \nNumber of students eliminated = $50\\%$ of the initial number of students\n= $\\frac{50}{100} \\times $ Initial number of students\n= $\\frac{1}{2} \\times $ Initial number of students\n\n**Step 2:** After the second round, \nNumber of students remaining = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times $ Number of students remaining after the first round\n= $\\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\text{Initial number of students} - \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Initial number of students})$\n= $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Initial number of students}$\n\n**Step 3:** Since 24 students were still in the contest after the second round, we have:\n$\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Initial number of students} = 24$\n**Multiplying both sides by 6:**\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Initial number of students} = 24 \\times 6$\n**Multiplying both sides by 2:**\n$\\text{Initial number of students} = (24 \\times 6) \\times 2$\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{288}$.
