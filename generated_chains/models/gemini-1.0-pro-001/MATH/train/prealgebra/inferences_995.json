At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEveryone in a class of 30 students takes math and history.  Seven students received an A in history and 13 received an A in math, including four that received an A in both courses. How many students did not receive an A in any of these two courses?",
        "inference": "Let's define the number of students who only received A's in History as \\(x\\), the number of students who only received A's in Math as \\(y\\), and the number of students who did not get A's in either course as \\(z\\).\n$$x + y + z = 30$$\n$$x + 4 = 7$$\n$$y + 4 = 13$$\nFrom the second and third equations, we can find the values of x and y:\n$$x = 3$$\n$$y = 9$$\nSubstitute these values into the first equation to find the value of z:\n$$3 + 9 + z = 30$$\n$$12 + z = 30$$\n$$z = 18$$\nTherefore, the number of students who did not receive an A in either course is 18.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Adding the numbers of students with A's in history and math gives $7+13 = 20$.  But this counts the 4 kids who got A's in both twice, so there are $20-4=16$ different students total who received an A in at least one of the courses.  That leaves $30-16=\\boxed{14}$ who didn't get an A in either."
