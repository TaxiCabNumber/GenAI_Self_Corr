        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of a pair of supplementary angles are in the ratio of 7:2. How many degrees are in the measure of their positive difference?",
        "inference": "Let x and 2x be the measures of the supplementary angles.\nThen x + 2x = 180.\n3x = 180.\nx = 60.\nTherefore, the measures of the supplementary angles are 60 degrees and 120 degrees.\nThe positive difference between the angles is 120 - 60 = 60 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{60}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the measures are in the ratio $7:2$, the measures are $7x$ and $2x$ for some value of $x$.  Since the angles are supplementary, we have $7x + 2x = 180^\\circ$, so $9x = 180^\\circ$ and $x= 20^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $7x=140^\\circ$ and $2x=40^\\circ$, so their positive difference is $140^\\circ - 40^\\circ = \\boxed{100^\\circ}$."
