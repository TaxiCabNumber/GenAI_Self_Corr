        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMs. Hamilton's eighth-grade class wants to participate in the annual three-person-team basketball tournament.  The losing team of each game is eliminated from the tournament.  If sixteen teams compete, how many games will be played to determine the winner?",
        "inference": "* First, we need to find the number of teams that will be eliminated in each round.  Since three teams play in each game and the losing team is eliminated, two teams will be eliminated in each game.\n* Next, we need to find the number of rounds that will be played.  Since sixteen teams are competing, we can use the formula $2^n = 16$ to find the number of rounds, where $n$ is the number of rounds.  Solving for $n$, we get $n = 4$.\n* Finally, we need to find the number of games that will be played.  Since there are four rounds and two teams are eliminated in each round, there will be a total of $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ games played.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "8 games in the first round will leave 8 teams remaining.  4 games in the second round will leave 4 teams remaining.  2 games in the third round will leave two teams remaining.  One final game is played to determine the overall winner of the tournament.  Thus, there will be $8+4+2+1=\\boxed{15}$ games to eliminate 15 teams.\n\n\n\nAnother way to quickly solve this problem is to note that every team except the winner must lose exactly once.  Therefore, 15 teams must lose, and each game has one loser, which means that there are 15 games."
