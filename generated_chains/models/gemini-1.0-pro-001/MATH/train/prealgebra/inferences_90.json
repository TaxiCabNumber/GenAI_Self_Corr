At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe NASA Space Shuttle transports material to the International Space Station at a cost of $\\$22,\\!000$ per kilogram. What is the number of dollars in the cost of transporting a 250 g control module?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. Convert 250 g to kg: $250 \\text{ g} = 250 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ kg} = 0.25 \\text{ kg}$.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of transporting 0.25 kg: $0.25 \\text{ kg} \\times \\$22,\\!000/\\text{kg} = \\$5500$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\$5500}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Two hundred fifty grams is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a kilogram.  Therefore, the cost of transporting a 250 g control module is $\\$22,\\!000/4=\\boxed{5500}$ dollars."
