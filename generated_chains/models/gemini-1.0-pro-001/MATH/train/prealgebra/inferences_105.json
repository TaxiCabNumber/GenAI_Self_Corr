At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a state contest, 21 Mathletes stay in the same hotel. Each Mathlete gets his/her own room and the room numbers are 1 through 21. When all the Mathletes have arrived, except the ones staying in rooms 12 and 13, what is the median room number of the other 19 Mathletes?",
        "inference": "1. Order the room numbers of the 19 Mathletes from least to greatest: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\n2. The median is the middle value of the ordered list.\n3. Since there are 19 Mathletes, the median is the average of the 10th and 11th values.\n4. Therefore, the median room number is (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9.5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are currently 19 Mathletes there, so if the room numbers are listed in order we want the 10th, with 9 rooms before and 9 after. The 10th room is just room number $\\boxed{10}$, since no numbers are skipped in the first ten."
