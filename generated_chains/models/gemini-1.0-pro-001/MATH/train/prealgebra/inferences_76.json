She empties her wallet and finds she only has three $\\$10$ bills, eight quarters, and a pile of dimes. What is the minimum number of dimes that must be in her pile so she can pay for the hoodie?",

Since each dime is worth $0.10, she needs at least $0.75/0.10 = 7.5$ dimes, or 8 dimes.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
