        "inference": "Let E be the event of rolling a 2. When rolling a fair 6-sided die, there are 6 possible outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The event E is a subset of these possible outcomes, namely {2}. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 is the number of outcomes in E divided by the total number of possible outcomes: P(E) = n(E) / n(S) = 1 / 6.\n\nLet F be the event of rolling a 4. Similarly, the probability of rolling a 4 is P(F) = 1 / 6.\n\nThe event of rolling a 2 or 4 is the union of events E and F. The probability of the union of two events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event minus the probability of their intersection: P(E or F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F).\n\nIn this case, the intersection of events E and F is the event of rolling a 2 and a 4, which is impossible. Therefore, P(E and F) = 0.\n\nSo, the probability of rolling a 2 or 4 is:\nP(E or F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E and F)\n= 1 / 6 + 1 / 6 - 0\n= 1 / 3\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1/3$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 total equally likely outcomes, and 2 successful outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
