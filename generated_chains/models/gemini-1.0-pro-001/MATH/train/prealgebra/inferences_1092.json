At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 12 members, each of whom can play any position.  In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a center, a power forward, a shooting forward, a point guard, and a shooting guard?",
