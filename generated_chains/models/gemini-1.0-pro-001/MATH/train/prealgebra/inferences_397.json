At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the greatest whole number that will satisfy this inequality: $4x-3 < 2 - x $.",

        "ground_truth": "We simplify the given inequality by adding $x+3$ to both sides, which leaves us with $5x < 5 \\Rightarrow x<1$. Since 1 is not less than itself, this leaves us with $x=\\boxed{0}$."
