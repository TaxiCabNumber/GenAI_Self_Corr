At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA burger at Ricky C's weighs 120 grams, of which 30 grams are filler.  What percent of the burger is not filler?",
        "inference": "Let x be the percent of the burger that is not filler.\nThen, 100 - x is the percent of the burger that is filler.\nSince 30 grams are filler, we have:\n30 = 120 * (100 - x) / 100\nMultiplying both sides by 100:\n3000 = 12000 - 120x\nSubtracting 12000 from both sides:\n-9000 = -120x\nDividing both sides by -120:\nx = 75\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$75$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $120 - 30 = 90$ grams that are not filler.  So $\\frac{90}{120} = \\boxed{75\\%}$ is not filler."
