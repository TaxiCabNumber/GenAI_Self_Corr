At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary wants to buy one large pizza, one medium pizza, and three drinks. The drinks cost $p$ dollars each, the medium pizza costs two times as much as one drink, and the large pizza costs three times as much as one drink. If Mary started with $30$ dollars, how much money would she have left after making all of her purchases?  Give your answer as an expression of $p$.",
        "inference": "The cost of one drink = $p$ dollars\nThe cost of a medium pizza = $2p$ dollars\nThe cost of a large pizza = $3p$ dollars\nTotal cost of purchases = $p + 2p + 3p + 3p = 9p$ dollars\nMoney left after making all the purchases = $30 - 9p$ dollars.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30 - 9p}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's first look at how much total money Mary spent. Since drinks cost $p$ dollars, and she bought $3$ of them, she spent $3p$ dollars on drinks. One drink costs $p$ dollars, so a medium pizza costs $2p$ dollars and a large pizza costs $3p$ dollars. Therefore, in total, Mary spent \\[3p+2p+3p=8p\\] dollars.\n\nNow, Mary had $30$ dollars to begin with, and she spent $8p$ dollars, so she has \\[\\boxed{30-8p}\\] dollars left."
