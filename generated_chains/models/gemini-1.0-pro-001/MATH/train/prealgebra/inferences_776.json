At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA digit is written to the right of the units digit of $757$.  If the resulting four-digit number is divisible by $3$, how many possibilities are there for the digit that was written?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince the resulting four-digit number is divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must be divisible by $3$.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $757$ is $7 + 5 + 7 = 19$, which is not divisible by $3$.\n\nTherefore, the digit that was written must be such that the sum of its digit and $19$ is divisible by $3$.\n\nThe only digits that satisfy this condition are $2$, $5$, and $8$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
