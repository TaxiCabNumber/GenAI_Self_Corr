At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular garden 50 feet long and 10 feet wide is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same fence, its shape is changed to a square. By how many square feet does this enlarge the garden?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden:\n\n$$P = 2(l + w) = 2(50 + 10) = 120 \\text{ feet}$$\n\n2. Since the perimeter is the same for a square, let's say the side length of the square is 's':\n\n$$s = P/4 = 120/4 = 30 \\text{ feet}$$\n\n3. Calculate the area of the rectangular garden:\n\n$$A_{rect} = l \\times w = 50 \\times 10 = 500 \\text{ square feet}$$\n\n4. Calculate the area of the square garden:\n\n$$A_{square} = s^2 = 30^2 = 900 \\text{ square feet}$$\n\n5. Subtract the area of the rectangular garden from the area of the square garden to find the increase:\n\n$$A_{increase} = A_{square} - A_{rect} = 900 - 500 = 400 \\text{ square feet}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$400$}.
