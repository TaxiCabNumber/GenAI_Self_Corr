At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMoore's law says that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on a silicon chip doubles every two years. In 1990, a typical CPU contained about $1,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors. According to Moore's law, how many transistors did a typical CPU contain in the year 2000?",
        "inference": "In 1990 the number of transistors was 1,000,000.\nIn 1992 it doubled to 2,000,000.\nIn 1994 it doubled again to 4,000,000.\nIn 1996 it doubled again to 8,000,000.\nIn 1998 it doubled again to 16,000,000.\nIn 2000 it doubled one more time to 32,000,000.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32,000,000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$2000-1990 = 10$ years passed between the years $1990$ and $2000$, during which the number of transistors doubled $10 \\div 2 = 5$ times. Doubling a number five times means multiplying it by two raised to the fifth power. Thus we carry out the multiplication to get our answer: \\[1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 2^5 = 1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{32,\\!000,\\!000} \\text{ transistors}.\\]"
