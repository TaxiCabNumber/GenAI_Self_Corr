At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSasha has $\\$3.20$ in U.S. coins. She has the same number of quarters and nickels. What is the greatest number of quarters she could have?",
        "inference": "Let the number of quarters equal \\(x\\). Then the number of nickels also equals \\(x\\).\n\nThe value of the quarters is $0.25x$.\n\nThe value of the nickels is $0.05x$.\n\nThe total value of the coins is $0.25x + 0.05x = 0.30x$.\n\nSince Sasha has $\\$3.20$ in coins, we have $0.30x = 3.20$.\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get $x = \\frac{3.20}{0.30} = 10.67$.\n\nSince the number of quarters must be an integer, the greatest number of quarters Sasha could have is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose Sasha has $q$ quarters.  Then she also has $q$ nickels, and the total value of her quarters and nickels is $.25q + .05q = .30q$.  Since $3.20/0.30 = 10\\frac{2}{3}$, this means that she has at most $\\boxed{10}$ quarters.  (This amount is obtainable; for example we can let the rest of her coins be pennies.)"
