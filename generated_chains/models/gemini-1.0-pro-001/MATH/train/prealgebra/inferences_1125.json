At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOut of 1200 people polled, $30\\%$ do not like radio, and $10\\%$ of the people who do not like radio also do not like music.  How many people polled do not like both radio and music?",
