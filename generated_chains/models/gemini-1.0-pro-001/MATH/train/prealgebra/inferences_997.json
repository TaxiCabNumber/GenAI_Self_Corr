At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a water tank is $30\\%$ full, it contains 27 gallons less than when it is $20\\%$ empty. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when it is full?",
        "inference": "Let the total capacity of the tank be x.\n\nIf $30\\%$ of the tank is full, then $70\\%$ of the tank is empty. This means the tank contains $0.3x$ gallons of water.\n\nIf $20\\%$ of the tank is empty, then $80\\%$ of the tank is full. This means the tank contains $0.8x$ gallons of water.\n\nWe are given that $0.8x - 0.3x = 27$.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$0.5x = 27$\n\n$x = 27/0.5$\n\n$x = 54$\n\nTherefore, the total capacity of the tank is 54 gallons.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$20\\%$ empty is the same thing as $80\\%$ full.  Thus, 27 gallons represents the difference between $80\\%$ and $30\\%$ of the tank, meaning that 27 gallons is $50\\%$ of the tank.  Since half the tank is 27 gallons, the entire tank can hold $\\boxed{54\\text{ gallons}}$."
