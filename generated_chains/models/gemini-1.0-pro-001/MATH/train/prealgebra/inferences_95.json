At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
        "inference": "If the discount is $30\\%$, then the resulting price is $70\\%$ of the original price. \nThen if the discount taken on the new price is $20\\%$, then the resulting price is $80\\%$ of the new price, which is $0.8\\times 0.7=0.56$ of the original price. \nThe implied discount is $50\\%$, which is $0.5$ of the original price. \nThe difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount is $0.56-0.5=0.06$, or $6\\%$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
