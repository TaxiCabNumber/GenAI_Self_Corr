At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a bag with only red, blue, and green marbles.  The ratio of red marbles to blue marbles to green marbles is $1:5:3$.  There are 27 green marbles in the bag.  How many marbles are there  in the bag?",
        "inference": "1. Set up a proportion: $\\frac{red}{blue}=\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{green}{3}$.\n\n2. From the given information, we know that $green=27$. So, $3=27$.\n\n3. Use this to solve for $red$ and $blue$: $red=1\\cdot9=9$, $blue=5\\cdot9=45$.\n\n4. Add up the number of marbles: $red+blue+green=9+45+27=\\boxed{81}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{81}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of red to blue to green marbles is $1:5:3$, the ratio of green marbles to the total number of marbles is $3/(1+5+3) = 3/9=1/3$.  Since the green marbles are one-third of the total, and there are 27 green marbles, there must be $3\\cdot 27 = \\boxed{81}$ total marbles."
