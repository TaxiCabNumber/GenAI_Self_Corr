        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Benton Youth Soccer Team has 20 players on the team, including reserves. Of these, three are goalies. Today, the team is having a contest to see which goalie can block the most number of penalty kicks. For each penalty kick, a goalie stands in the net while the rest of the team (including other goalies) takes a shot on goal, one at a time, attempting to place the ball in the net.\n\nHow many penalty kicks must be taken to ensure that everyone has gone up against each of the goalies?",
        "inference": "There are 20 players on the team, including three goalkeepers. So there are 17 players who are not goalkeepers. Each of these 17 players will need to take a penalty kick against each of the three goalkeepers. So, a total of 17 * 3 = 51 penalty kicks must be taken.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{51}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For each of the $3$ goalies who stand in the net, there are $19$ other players who will kick to the goalie. That makes $3 \\cdot 19 = \\boxed{57}$ penalty kicks that must be taken."
