At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf an integer is divisible by $4$ and the sum of its last two digits is $13$, then what is the product of its last two digits?",
        "inference": "Let the integer be $xy$, where $x$ is the tens digit and $y$ is the units digit. We can write the total number as $10x + y$. We know that $10x + y$ is divisible by $4$, so $10x + y = 4k$ for some integer $k$. \nAdditionally, we know that $x + y = 13$ since the sum of the last two digits is $13$. Solving for $y$ in the second equation, we get $y = 13 - x$. Then substituting into the first equation we get $$10x + (13-x) = 4k$$ \nSimplifying the equation, we get $$9x + 13 = 4k$$ \nRearranging, we get $$9x = 4k - 13$$ \nSince $4k$ is a multiple of $4$, $4k - 13$ is also a multiple of $4$. \nTherefore, $9x$ is a multiple of $4$, so $x$ is a multiple of $4$, which means $x = 4m$. \nSubstituting $x = 4m$ into the equation $x + y = 13$, we get $$4m + y = 13$$ \nRearranging, we get $$y = 13 - 4m$$ \nSince $x$ is a multiple of $4$, $m$ is an integer, so $y$ is an integer. \nThus, the product of the last two digits is $xy = (4m)(13 - 4m) = 4(13m - 4m^2)$. \nWe can factor out $4$, so the product is $4(13m - 4m^2) = 4m(13 - 4m)$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4m(13 - 4m)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $A$ is the tens digit and $B$ the units digit, then the two-digit number $AB$ (having $A$ in the tens place and $B$ in the units place) must be one of the following: $49$, $58$, $67$, $76$, $85$, $94$.  Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$.  So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\\cdot B = 7\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{42}$."
