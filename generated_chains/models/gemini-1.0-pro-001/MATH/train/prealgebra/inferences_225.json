        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA room is 19 feet long and 11 feet wide. Find the ratio of the length of the room to its perimeter. Express your answer in the form $a:b$.",
        "inference": "Perimeter of the room = 2(length + width) = 2(19 + 11) = 2(30) = 60 feet\nRatio of the length of the room to its perimeter = length : perimeter = 19 : 60 = 19/60\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19:60}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width. In this case, the perimeter is $2(19+11)=2(30)=60$ feet. Thus, the ratio of the length of the room to its perimeter is $\\boxed{19:60}$."
