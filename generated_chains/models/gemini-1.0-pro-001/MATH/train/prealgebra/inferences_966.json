        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA piece of string fits exactly once around the perimeter of a square whose area is 144.  Rounded to the nearest whole number, what is the area of the largest circle that can be formed from the piece of string?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the perimeter of the square.**\n\nThe area of a square is given by the formula $A=s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. So, the side length of the square is $s=\\sqrt{144}=12$. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula $P=4s$, so the perimeter of the square is $P=4\\cdot12=48$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the circumference of the circle.**\n\nThe circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C=2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the perimeter of the square is equal to the circumference of the circle, we have $48=2\\pi r$. Solving for $r$, we get $r=\\frac{48}{2\\pi}=7.64$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the area of the circle.**\n\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula $A=\\pi r^2$, so the area of the circle is $A=\\pi\\cdot7.64^2=183.24$.\n\n**Step 4: Round to the nearest whole number.**\n\nRounding $183.24$ to the nearest whole number gives us $183$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{183}$. I hope it is correct.**",
