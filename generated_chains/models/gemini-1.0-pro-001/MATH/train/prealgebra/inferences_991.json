At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the figure below, the largest circle has a radius of six meters. Five congruent smaller circles are placed as shown and are lined up in east-to-west and north-to-south orientations. What is the radius in meters of one of the five smaller circles?\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(3cm,3cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,2),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,-2),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\n\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The circles are made up of a 3x3 square grid. The total diameter of the large circle is 12 meters, and the small circles are lined up with the opposite sides of the large circle. So, the diameter of each of the smaller circles is 12/5 = 2.4 meters. Thus, the radius of each of the smaller circles is 1.2 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1.2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can see that the diameters of three of the smaller circles make up the diameter of the larger circle. It follows that the radius of one of the smaller circles is one-third of the radius of the larger circle. Since the larger circle has a radius of 6 meters, our answer is $6/3 = \\boxed{2}$ meters."
