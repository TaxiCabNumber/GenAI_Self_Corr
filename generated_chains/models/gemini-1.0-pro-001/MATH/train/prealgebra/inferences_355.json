At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe distance between two cities on a map is 15 inches. If the scale is 0.25 inches = 3 miles, how many miles apart are the actual cities?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the distance on the map to the actual distance between the cities.\n\n**Step 1:** Find the scale factor:\n\n```\nScale factor = Actual distance / Map distance\n           = 3 miles / 0.25 inches\n           = 12 miles per inch\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply the map distance by the scale factor to find the actual distance:\n\n```\nActual distance = Map distance * Scale factor\n               = 15 inches * 12 miles per inch\n               = 180 miles\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{180}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If 0.25 inches represents 3 miles, we have that 1 inch represents 12 miles. Therefore, 15 inches represents $\\boxed{180\\text{ miles}}$."
