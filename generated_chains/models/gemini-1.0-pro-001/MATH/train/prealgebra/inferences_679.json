        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo identical CDs regularly cost a total of $\\$28.$ What is the cost in dollars of five of these CDs?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the cost of one CD.\n\nThen, two CDs cost $2x$ dollars.\n\nWe know that two CDs cost $28 dollars, so we have the equation\n\n$$2x = 28.$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get\n\n$$x = 14.$$\n\nTherefore, the cost of one CD is $14 dollars.\n\nThe cost of five CDs is $5 \\times 14 = 70$ dollars.\n\n**Final Answer: $70$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In general, 5 CDs will cost $\\frac{5}{2}$ times as much as 2 CDs.  Thus the desired cost is $28\\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = \\boxed{70}$ dollars."
