At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular convex polygon with seven sides has exactly one right angle. How many diagonals does this seven-sided polygon have?",
        "inference": "The polygon has seven sides, so it has 7 vertices. A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices. So, we need to find the number of ways to choose two vertices from a set of 7 vertices, excluding the two vertices that form the right angle.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 vertices from a set of 7 vertices is 7 choose 2 = 21. However, if we choose 2 vertices that form the right angle, then we have counted that pair twice. So, we need to subtract 1 from this total.\n\nTherefore, the number of diagonals is 21 - 1 = 20.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For each vertex, we can create a diagonal by connecting it to any non-adjacent vertex. If there are $n$ vertices, there are $n(n-3)$ diagonals we draw. But we are over-counting by a factor of 2 since each diagonal can be created from 2 vertices. So there are $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals. In this problem, since $n=7$, there are $7\\cdot4/2=\\boxed{14}$ diagonals."
