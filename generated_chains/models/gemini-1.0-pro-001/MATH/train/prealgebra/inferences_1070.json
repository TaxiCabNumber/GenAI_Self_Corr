        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the measures of the acute angles of a right triangle is $8:1$. In degrees, what is the measure of the largest angle of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let the measure of the smaller acute angle be 8x and the measure of the larger acute angle be x. Then, we have:\n\n8x + x = 180 - 90\n9x = 90\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the measure of the larger acute angle is 10x = 10 * 10 = 100 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The actual degree measures of the acute angles don't matter. A right triangle consists of a right angle of $90^\\circ$ and two acute angles that add up to $90^\\circ$, so each of the two acute angles is smaller than the right angle. Also recall that the definition of an acute angle is that its degree measure is less than $90^\\circ$. So the largest angle of the triangle is the right angle, which has a measure of $\\boxed{90^\\circ}$."
