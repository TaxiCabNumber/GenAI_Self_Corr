At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old, how many years old is the oldest child?",
        "inference": "Let the age of the oldest child be x years.\n\nThen, the sum of the ages of the three children can be expressed as 4 + 7 + x.\n\nAccording to the given information, the average age of the three children is 7 years. Therefore, we can write:\n\n(4 + 7 + x) / 3 = 7\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n4 + 7 + x = 21\nx = 21 - 11\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the oldest child is 10 years old.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
