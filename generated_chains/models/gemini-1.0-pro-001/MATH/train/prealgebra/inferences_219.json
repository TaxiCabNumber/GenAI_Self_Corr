At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKenton watched 2000 adult men and women board a cruise ship. Half of the adults were women. If 20$\\%$ of the women and 9$\\%$ of the men were wearing sunglasses, what was the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses?",
        "inference": "1. Number of women on the ship = 2000/2 = 1000\n\n2. Number of men on the ship = 2000 - 1000 = 1000\n\n3.  Number of women wearing sunglasses = 1000 * 20/100 = 200\n\n4. Number of men wearing sunglasses = 1000 * 9/100 = 90\n\n5. Total number of people wearing sunglasses = 200 + 90 = 290\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$290$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men.  Thus, $20\\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses."
