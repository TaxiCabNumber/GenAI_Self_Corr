        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA school is arranging chairs in rows for an assembly. $11$ chairs make a complete row, and right now there are $110$ chairs total. The school wants to have as few empty seats as possible, but all rows of chairs must be complete. If $70$ students will attend the assembly, how many chairs should be removed?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find how many rows of chairs can be made with $110$ chairs. To do this, we divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs per row: \\begin{equation*}\n110 \\div 11 = 10\n\\end{equation*}\nSo, $10$ complete rows of chairs can be made.\n\nNext, we need to find how many empty seats there will be if $70$ students attend the assembly. To do this, we subtract the number of students from the total number of chairs: \\begin{equation*}\n110 - 70 = 40\n\\end{equation*}\nSo, there will be $40$ empty seats if $70$ students attend the assembly.\n\nSince the school wants to have as few empty seats as possible, we need to remove some chairs. We want to remove enough chairs so that there will be enough chairs for all of the students, but no empty chairs. To do this, we need to find the number of chairs that we need to remove. We can do this by subtracting the number of students from the total number of chairs: \\begin{equation*}\n110 - 70 = 40\n\\end{equation*}\nSo, we need to remove $40$ chairs.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The original number of chairs is divisible by $11$, and the final number of remaining chairs must also be divisible by $11$ to have complete rows. This means that the number of chairs removed must be divisible by $11$ because the difference between two multiples of $b$ is also a multiple of $b$. In other words, $$b \\cdot m - b \\cdot n = b \\cdot k.$$ The smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $70$ is $77$, so we want $77$ chairs to remain. This means we must take away \\begin{align*}\n110 - 77 &= 11 \\cdot 10 - 11 \\cdot 7 \\\\\n&= 11(10-7) \\\\\n&= 11 \\cdot 3 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{33}\n\\end{align*} chairs. We check that $33$ is divisible by $11$, and it is, so we took away $3$ complete rows of chairs."
