At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular tile measures 3 inches by 4 inches. What is the fewest number of these tiles that are needed to completely cover a rectangular region that is 2 feet by 5 feet?",

Each tile has an area in square feet of $\\left ( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\right ) \\left ( \\dfrac{1}{3} \\right ) =\n\\dfrac{1}{12}$, so the minimum number of tiles is $\\dfrac{10}{\\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\right)} = \\boxed{120}.$"
