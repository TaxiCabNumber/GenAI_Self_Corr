At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 4-inch by 6-inch picture is enlarged for framing  by tripling its dimensions.  A 2-inch-wide border  is then placed around each side of the enlarged  picture, as shown.  Thin metal framing is sold only  in increments of one foot.  What is the minimum  number of linear feet of framing that must be  purchased to go around the perimeter of the border?\n\n[asy]\n\ndraw((0,0)--(14,0)--(14,20)--(0,20)--cycle,linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((4,4)--(10,4)--(10,16)--(4,16)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"border\",(7,17),N);\n\nlabel(\"picture\",(7,8),N);\n\nlabel(\"frame\",(14,5),E);\n\ndraw((17.5,7.5)--(14.5,7.5),Arrow);\ndraw((10.5,7.5)--(13.5,7.5),Arrow);\n\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The outer dimentions of the border are 18 inches by 24 inches.  Converting to feet, this is 1.5 feet by 2 feet.  The perimeter of this rectangle is \\(2(1.5 + 2) = 2(3.5) = 7\\) feet.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After the picture is enlarged by tripling its dimensions, the dimensions become $12\\times18$. After the border is added, the dimensions of the picture increase to $16\\times22$ (since each side has a 2-inch border). The perimeter is $16+16+22+22=76$ inches. Since $76/12=6\\frac{1}{3}$, we need $\\boxed{7}$ feet of framing to go around the entire picture."
