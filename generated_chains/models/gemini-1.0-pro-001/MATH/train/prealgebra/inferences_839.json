I hope it is correct.'\nA small square is entirely contained in a larger square, as shown. The side length of the small square is 3 units and the side length of the larger square is 7 units. What is the number of square units in the area of the black region?\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(21,0)--(21,21)--(0,21)--cycle,black);\nfill((9,4)--(9,13)--(18,13)--(18,4)--cycle,white);\n[/asy]",
