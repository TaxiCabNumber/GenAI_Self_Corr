At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a kennel with 60 dogs, 9 dogs like watermelon, 48 dogs like salmon, and 5 like both salmon and watermelon.  How many dogs in the kennel will not eat either?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet W be the number of dogs that like watermelon only, and S be the number of dogs that like salmon only.  Since 9 dogs like watermelon, 5 of whom also like salmon, we have W = 9 - 5 = 4.  Since 48 dogs like salmon, 5 of whom also like watermelon, we have S = 48 - 5 = 43.  Therefore, the total number of dogs that like either watermelon or salmon is 4 + 43 = 47.  Since there are 60 dogs in total, the number of dogs that like neither watermelon nor salmon is 60 - 47 = 13.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve the problem with a Venn Diagram.  First we know that 5 dogs will eat both salmon and watermelon:\n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"Watermelon\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Salmon\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$5$\", (44, 45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$126-x$\",(28,58));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$129-x$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nThis tells us that $9-5=4$ of the dogs like only watermelon and $48-5=43$ of the dogs like only salmon.\n\n[asy]\nlabel(\"Watermelon\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Salmon\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$5$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$4$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$43$\",(63,45));\n[/asy]\n\nTherefore $5+4+43=52$ of the dogs like at least one of these foods.
