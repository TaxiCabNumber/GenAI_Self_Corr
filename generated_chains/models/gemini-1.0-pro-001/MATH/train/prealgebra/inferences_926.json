At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI am playing a walking game with myself.  On move 1, I do nothing, but on move $n$ where $2 \\le n \\le 25$, I take one step forward if $n$ is prime and two steps backwards if the number is composite.  After all 25 moves, I stop and walk back to my original starting point.  How many steps long is my walk back?",
        "inference": "I do nothing on move 1.\n\nOn move 2, I take one step forward because 2 is prime.\n\nOn move 3, I take two steps backward because 3 is prime.\n\nOn move 4, I take one step forward because 4 is not prime.\n\nOn move 5, I take two steps backward because 5 is prime.\n\nThis pattern continues until move 25.\n\nOverall, I take 1 step forward and 12 steps backward.\n\nMy walk back is $12 \\cdot 2 = 24$ steps long.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by counting how many prime and composite numbers there are between 2 and 25 inclusive.  The prime numbers in that range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, so there are 9 prime numbers.  This means that there are $24 - 9 = 15$ composite numbers.\n\nFor each of the 9 prime numbers, I take one step forward, and for each of the 15 composite numbers, I take two steps back, for a net total of $9(1)+(15)(-2)=-21$ steps forward, i.e., 21 steps backwards.  Hence after 25 moves, I am 21 steps away from my original starting point, so my walk back is $\\boxed{21}$ steps long."
