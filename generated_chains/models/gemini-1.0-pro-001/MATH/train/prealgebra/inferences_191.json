At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square is divided into five congruent rectangles, as shown. If the perimeter of each of these five rectangles is 36 inches, what is the perimeter of the square, in inches?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(0,5)--(5,5)--(5,0)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,5));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,5));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,5));\n[/asy]",

        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square.  Then the dimensions of each rectangle are $s\\times\\frac{s}{5}$.  The perimeter of one of the rectangles is $s+\\frac{s}{5}+s+\\frac{s}{5}=\\frac{12}{5}s$.  Setting $\\frac{12}{5}s=36$ inches, we find $s=15$ inches.  The perimeter of the square is $4s=4(15\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{60}$ inches."
