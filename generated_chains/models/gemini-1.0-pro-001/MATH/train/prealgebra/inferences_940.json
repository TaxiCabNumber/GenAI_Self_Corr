        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine wishes to purchase some trading cards. She has $\\$7.50$ and the cards each cost $\\$0.85$, tax included. What is the most number of cards she can buy?",
        "inference": "1. Find the cost of one card: $0.85 per card\n2. Divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one card: $7.50 / 0.85 = 8.82$ cards\n3. Since she cannot buy a fraction of a card, she can buy the greatest integer number of cards, which is 8 cards.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The cost of $n$ cards is $(0.85)n$ dollars. Jasmine can buy $n$ cards only if $(0.85)n \\le 7.5$. Rewriting this inequality in terms of fractions, we have $$\\frac{17}{20}n\\le \\frac{15}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{20}{17}$ gives $$n \\le \\frac{150}{17},$$ and converting to mixed numbers gives $$n \\le 8\\frac{14}{17}.$$ Since Jasmine must buy a whole number of trading cards, the largest number she can afford is $\\boxed{8}$."
