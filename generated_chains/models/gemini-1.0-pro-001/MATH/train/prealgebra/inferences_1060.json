At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution**\nA number is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. \nSo, we need to find the value of $d$ such that $2+3+4+5+d=9k$ for some integer $k$. \nSimplifying, we get $d=9k-14$. \nSince $d$ is a digit, $d$ must be a nonnegative integer less than $10$. \nThus, we have $9k-14<10$, which gives $k<4$. \nSince $k$ is an integer, the only possible value is $k=3$, which gives $d=9\\cdot3-14=\\boxed{11}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$11$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+3+4+5=14$, the only single digit that will make the sum a multiple of 9 is $4$. The sum of the digits would be $18$, which is $9\\cdot 2$, so $d=\\boxed{4}$."
