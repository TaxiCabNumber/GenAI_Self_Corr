        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest prime factor of 1821?",
        "inference": "We can find the prime factorization of 1821 as follows:\n\n1821 = 3 * 607\n\n607 is prime, so the smallest prime factor of 1821 is 3.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "1821 is clearly not even, so 2 is not a factor. We find that 3 is a factor, since the sum of the digits of 1821 is $1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12$, which is divisible by 3. Since we want the smallest prime factor, we are done; our answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
