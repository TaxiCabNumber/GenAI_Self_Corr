At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of degrees in the measures of the interior angles of a convex pentagon are five consecutive integers. What is the number of degrees in the largest angle?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let the number of the smallest angle be x. Then, the measures of the other angles are x+1, x+2, x+3, and x+4.\n**Step 2**: The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees. So, x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = 540.\n**Step 3**: 5x + 10 = 540\n**Step 4**: 5x = 530\n**Step 5**: x = 106\n**Step 6**: The largest angle is x+4 = 106 + 4 = 110\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{110}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose we list the angle measures in increasing order.  Let $x$ be the measure of the middle angle in degrees. Then, the five angles have measures $x -2^\\circ$, $x-1^\\circ$, $x$, $x + 1^\\circ$, and $x+2^\\circ$.  The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so \\[(x -2^\\circ)+(x-1^\\circ)+(x)+(x + 1^\\circ) +(x+2^\\circ) = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $5x = 540^\\circ$, and dividing both sides by 5 gives $x = 108^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $x + 2^\\circ = \\boxed{110^\\circ}$."
