        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmma had just been given some coins by her parents.  On the way to school she lost exactly half of them, and then by retracing her steps she found exactly four-fifths of the coins she had lost.  What fraction of the coins that she received from her parents were still missing after Emma retraced her steps? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution**:\n* Emma lost exactly half of her coins, so she had $\\frac{1}{2}$ of her coins left.\n* She then found exactly four-fifths of the coins she had lost, which is $\\frac{4}{5}$ of $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n* So, she had $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{7}{10}$ of her coins left after finding some of the coins she had lost.\n* Therefore, she lost $\\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}$ of her coins.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{10}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the number of coins Emma received from her parents be $x$. She lost $\\frac{1}{2}x$ coins on the way to school. She found $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}x=\\frac{2}{5}x$ of the coins by retracing her steps. Thus, Emma has $\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{2}{5}x=\\frac{9}{10}x$ coins.
