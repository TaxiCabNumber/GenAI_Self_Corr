        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle has an area of 400 $\\text{cm}^2$. If the rectangle is a square, what is its perimeter?",
        "inference": "Let's call the side length of the square $x$.\n\nThe area of a square is $x^2$. So, we have:\n\n$$x^2 = 400$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 20$$\n\nThe perimeter of a square is $4x$. So, we have:\n\n$$4x = 4(20) = 80$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{80}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $s$ is the side of the square, then $s^2=400$.  Therefore, $s=20$.  The perimeter is $4(20)=\\boxed{80}$ cm."
