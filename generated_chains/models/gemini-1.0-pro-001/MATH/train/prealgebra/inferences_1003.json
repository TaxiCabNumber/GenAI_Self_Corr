At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a party, each man danced with exactly three women and each woman danced with exactly two men. Twelve men attended the party. How many women attended the party?",

        "ground_truth": "Because each man danced with exactly three women, there were $(12)(3)=36$ pairs of men and women who danced together. Each woman had two partners, so the number of women who attended is $36/2=\\boxed{18}.$"
