        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLucy has $19$ dollars and $23$ cents. She wants to buy as many popsicles as she can with her money. The popsicles are priced at $1$ dollar and $60$ cents each. How many popsicles can she buy?",
        "inference": "First, convert the money to cents.\n\n$19$ dollars and $23$ cents = $1900$ cents + $23$ cents = $1923$ cents\n\nNext, divide the number of cents by the price of each popsicle.\n\n$1923$ cents / $160$ cents/popsicle = $12$ popsicles\n\nTherefore, Lucy can buy $12$ popsicles.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can make an inequality with the number of popsicles being the variable $x$.\n$1.60 \\cdot x < 19.23$\nDividing 19.23 by 1.60, we find that the integer part of the quotient is 12. In particular, we have $1.60 \\cdot 12 = 19.2$. So she can buy at most $\\boxed{12}$ popsicles."
