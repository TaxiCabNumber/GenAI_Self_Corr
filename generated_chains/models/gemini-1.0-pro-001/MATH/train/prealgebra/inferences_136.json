At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOf the 100 students in the science club, 65 take mathematics, 43 take physics and 10 students take both mathematics and physics. How many science club students take neither mathematics nor physics?",

The number of students taking both mathematics and physics is 10.\n\n4. To find the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics, we need to subtract the number of students taking mathematics, the number of students taking physics, and the number of students taking both mathematics and physics from the total number of students in the science club.\n\n5. Therefore, the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics is 100 - 65 - 43 + 10 = 22.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{22}. I hope it is correct.",
