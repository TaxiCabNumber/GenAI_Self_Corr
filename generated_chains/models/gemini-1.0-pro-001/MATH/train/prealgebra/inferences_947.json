At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 6 married couples at a party. At the start of the party, every person shakes hands once with every other person except his or her spouse. How many handshakes are there?",
