At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stock investment went up $25\\%$ in 2006. Starting at this increased value, what percent would it have to go down in 2007 to be back to its original price at the beginning of 2006?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the original price of the stock. Then, after the 25% increase in 2006, the price of the stock becomes $x + 0.25x = 1.25x$. To get back to the original price, the stock would have to go down by 25%, which is $0.25 * 1.25x = 0.3125x$. Therefore, the percent decrease would be $\\frac{0.3125x}{1.25x} * 100\\% = \\boxed{25\\\\%}.$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{25\\\\%}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the original price of the stock. This means that the price of the stock is $1.25x$ at the end of 2006. The original price is $\\frac{x}{1.25x} = 80$ percent of this price, so the stock must decrease by $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
