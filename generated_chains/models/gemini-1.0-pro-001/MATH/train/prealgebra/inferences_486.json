        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmily's quiz scores so far are: 92, 95, 87, 89 and 100. What score does she need to get on the sixth quiz to make the arithmetic mean of the six scores equal 93?",
        "inference": "Let x be the score she needs to get on the sixth quiz. Then the mean of all six scores is (92+95+87+89+100+x) /6 = 93.\nSolving this equation gives x = 98.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{98}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Subtract 90 from every score to simplify the arithmetic.  For the average of 6 scores to be 3, their sum must be $6\\times3=18$.  The sum of her first five scores is $2+5-3-1+10=13$, so the sixth score should be $18-13=5$.  Adding 90 back, her score should be $\\boxed{95}$."
