At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $4\\sqrt{2}$ units. How many square units are in the area of the triangle?",
        "inference": "The area of an isosceles right triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$\nSince the triangle is isosceles, the legs are equal. Therefore, let $x$ be the length of each leg. Then the hypotenuse is $4\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate $x$ and $4\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$x^2 + x^2 = (4\\sqrt{2})^2$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 2x^2 = 32$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2 = 16$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x = 4$$\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}bh = \\frac{1}{2}(4)(4) = \\boxed{8}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg of the triangle has length 4.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(4)(4)/2 = \\boxed{8}$ square units."
