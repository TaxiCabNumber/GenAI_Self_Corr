Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "The number $4!=24$ has prime factorization $2^33^1$. A factor of 24 must have between zero and three 2's in its prime factorization, and between zero and one 3's in its prime factorization. Therefore, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ factors, and the probability that a number randomly chosen from the given set is a factor of 24 is $\\frac{8}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
