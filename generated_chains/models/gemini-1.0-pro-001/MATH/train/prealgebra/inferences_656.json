At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $d$ be a positive number such that when $109$ is divided by $d$, the remainder is $4.$ Compute the sum of all possible two-digit values of $d$.",
        "inference": "Since $109$ divided by $d$ leaves a remainder of $4$, we have $109 = dq + 4$ for some integer $q$.  \n\nSolving for $d$, we get $d = \\dfrac{109 - 4}{q} = \\dfrac{105}{q}$.  \n\nSince $d$ is a positive two-digit number, we have $10 \\leq d \\leq 99$, so $10 \\leq \\dfrac{105}{q} \\leq 99$.  \n\nThe only integer $q$ that satisfies this inequality is $q = 1$, so $d = 105$.  \n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible two-digit values of $d$ is $d = 105$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{105}$.

        "ground_truth": "If 4 is subtracted from 109, the result is 105. Then each of the two-digit numbers that will divide 109 with a remainder of 4 will divide 105 exactly. Thus, the problem is equivalent to finding all two-digit divisors of 105. Since the prime factors of 105 are 3, 5, and 7, the divisors are $3\\times5$, $3\\times7$, and $5\\times7$, or $15, 21,\\text{and }35$ with a sum of $\\boxed{71}$."
