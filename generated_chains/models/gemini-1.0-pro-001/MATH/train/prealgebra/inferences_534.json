I hope it is correct.'\nBilly wants to determine the average number of cookies in a package of cookies. He purchases 7 packages of cookies, opens them, and counts the number of cookies in each one. He finds that the packages have 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 20 cookies. Based on these observations, what is the average number of cookies in a package?\n\n(Note: the average of a list of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by how many numbers there are.)",

He finds that the packages have 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 20 cookies. Based on these observations, what is the average number of cookies in a package?\n\n1. Add up the total number of cookies in all 7 packages: 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 20 = 98 cookies. \n2. Divide the total number of cookies by the number of packages: 98 cookies \u00f7 7 packages = 14 cookies per package.\n\nFinal Answer: $$\\boxed{14}$$. I hope it is correct.",
