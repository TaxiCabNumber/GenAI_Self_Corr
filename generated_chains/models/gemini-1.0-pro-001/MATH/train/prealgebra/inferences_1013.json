At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA school band found they could arrange themselves in rows of 6, 7, or 8 with no one left over. What is the minimum number of students in the band?",
        "inference": "Let **x** be the number of students.\n\nSince x has to be divisible by 6, 7, and 8, x is a common multiple of 6, 7, and 8.\n\n**6 = 2 * 3**\n**7 = 7**\n**8 = 2 * 2 * 2**\n\nTherefore, **LCM(6, 7, 8) = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 = 168**\n\nThus, **x = 168**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$168$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The problem specifies that the number of students in the band is a multiple of 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, we are looking for the least common multiple of 6, 7, and 8. Prime factorizing the three numbers and taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot 7=\\boxed{168}$."
