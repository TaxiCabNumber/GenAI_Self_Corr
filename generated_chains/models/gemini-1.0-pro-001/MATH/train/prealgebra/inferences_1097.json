I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in units, of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg lengths of 75 and 100 units?",
        "inference": "The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of one leg plus the square of the length of the other leg is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. In other words, if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle, then $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2.$$\n\nIn this case, the lengths of the legs are 75 units and 100 units. So, the length of the hypotenuse is $$\\sqrt{75^2 + 100^2} = \\sqrt{5625 + 10000} = \\sqrt{15625} = 125.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{125}$. I hope it is correct.",
