At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA list of five positive integers has all of the following properties:\n\n$\\bullet$  The only integer in the list that occurs more than once is $8,$\n\n$\\bullet$  its median is $9,$ and\n\n$\\bullet$  its average (mean) is $10.$\n\nWhat is the largest possible integer that could appear in the list?",
        "inference": "The median is 9, so the list has two values less than 9 and two values greater than 9. Since the average is 10, the sum of the values is $5 \\times 10 = 50.$ Of these 50, 9 must be contributed by 8, and so the other four values must sum to $50 - 9 = 41.$ Since two of them are less than 9, the largest possible value for one of them is 8, and the sum of the two must be at most $2 \\times 8 = 16.$ This leaves $41 - 16 = 25$ for the other two values, and the largest possible value for one of them is 12.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12}.$ I hope it is correct.**",

Since the median of the list is $9,$ then the middle number (that is, the third number) in the list is $9.$ Thus, the list can be written as $a,$ $b,$ $9,$ $d,$ $e.$\n\nSince $8$ occurs more than once and the middle number is $9,$ then $8$ must occur twice only with $a=b=8.$ Thus, the list can be written as $8,$ $8,$ $9,$ $d,$ $e.$\n\nSince the average is $10$ and there are $5$ numbers in the list, then the sum of the numbers in the list is $5(10)=50.$ Therefore, $8+8+9+d+e=50$ or $25+d+e=50$ or $d+e=25.$\n\nSince $8$ is the only integer that occurs more than once in the list, then $d>9.$ Thus, $10 \\leq d < e$ and $d+e=25.$ To make $e$ as large as possible, we make $d$ as small as possible, so we make $d=10,$ and so $e=15.$\n\nThe list $8,$ $8,$ $9,$ $10,$ $15$ has the desired properties, so the largest possible integer that could appear in the list is $\\boxed{15}.$"
