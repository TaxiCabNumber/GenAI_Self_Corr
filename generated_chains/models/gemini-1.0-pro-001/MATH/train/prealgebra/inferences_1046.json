At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a list of five positive integers, none greater than 100, the mean is 1.5 times the mode. If 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ are the five integers, what is the value of $x$?",
        "inference": "The mean of the five integers is $\\frac{31+58+98+x+x}{5} = \\frac{187+2x}{5}$ and the mode is $x$. Since the mean is $1.5$ times the mode, we have $\\frac{187+2x}{5} = 1.5x$. Solving for $x$, we get $187+2x = 7.5x$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get $187 = 5.5x$. Dividing both sides by $5.5$, we get $x = \\boxed{34}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The mean of the list 31, 58, 98, $x$ and $x$ is $(31+58+98+2x)/5=(187+2x)/5$, and the mode is $x$.  Solving $1.5x=(187+2x)/5$ we find $x=\\boxed{34}$."
