        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne of the following four-digit numbers is not divisible by 4: 3544, 3554, 3564, 3572, 3576. What is the product of the units digit and the tens digit of that number?",
        "inference": "3544 is divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 44, are divisible by 4.\n3554 is divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 54, are divisible by 4.\n3564 is divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 64, are divisible by 4.\n3572 is divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 72, are divisible by 4.\n3576 is not divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 76, are not divisible by 4.\nThe units digit of 3576 is 6, and the tens digit is 7.\nThe product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3576 is 6 * 7 = 42.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{42}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4. The only given number that is not divisible by 4 is 3554 because 54 is not divisible by 4. The product of the units digit and the tens digit of 3554 is $5\\cdot 4=\\boxed{20}$."
