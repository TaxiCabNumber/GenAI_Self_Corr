        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChristine must buy at least $45$ fluid ounces of milk at the store. The store only sells milk in $200$ milliliter bottles. If there are $33.8$ fluid ounces in $1$ liter, then what is the smallest number of bottles that Christine could buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nFirst convert $45$ fluid ounces to milliliters: $$45\\text{ fl oz}\\cdot\\frac{29.57\\text{ mL}}{1\\text{ fl oz}}=1325.15\\text{ mL}$$\n\nNext divide this volume by the volume of each bottle to find the smallest number of bottles needed: $$\\frac{1325.15\\text{ mL}}{200\\text{ mL}}=6.62575$$\n\nSince Christine must buy a whole number of bottles, she must buy $7$ bottles.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First we convert the amount of milk Christine must buy from ounces to liters. We use the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}}$ to obtain $45\\ \\text{fl.oz} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}} \\approx 1.331\\ \\text{L}$. There are $1000\\ \\text{mL}$ in one liter, and $\\frac{1331}{200} \\approx 6.657$, so Christine must buy at least $\\boxed{7}$ bottles of milk at the store."
