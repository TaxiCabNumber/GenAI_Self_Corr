        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe area of the square is $25$, so each side of the square is $\\sqrt{25}=5$.\nSince the rectangle has the same width as the square, the width of the rectangle is $5$.\nThe length of the rectangle is double its width, so the length of the rectangle is $2\\cdot5=10$.\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is $5\\cdot10=\\boxed{50}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{50}$.

        "ground_truth": "For the square to have an area of $25,$ each side length must be $\\sqrt{25}=5.$\n\nThe rectangle's width is equal to that of the square and therefore must also be $5.$ The length of the rectangle is double its width or $5\\times 2=10.$ The area of the rectangle is thus $5\\times 10=\\boxed{50}.$"
