        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nThe area of the triangle is:\n\n$$Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height$$\n\nWe know the area is 120 square units, so we can solve for the height:\n\n$$120 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 24 \\times height$$\n\n$$height = 10$$\n\nThe perimeter of the triangle is:\n\n$$Perimeter = base + height + hypotenuse$$\n\nWe know the base is 24 units and the height is 10 units. We need to find the hypotenuse.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the hypotenuse:\n\n$$hypotenuse^2 = base^2 + height^2$$\n\n$$hypotenuse^2 = 24^2 + 10^2$$\n\n$$hypotenuse^2 = 676$$\n\n$$hypotenuse = 26$$\n\nSo, the perimeter of the triangle is:\n\n$$Perimeter = 24 + 10 + 26$$\n\n$$Perimeter = 60$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the other leg have length $x$.  From the area of the triangle, we have $\\frac12(24)(x) = 120$, so $12x = 120$ and $x=10$.  Let $c$ be the hypotenuse of the triangle.  The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $c^2 = 10^2 + 24^2 = 100 + 576 = 676$, so $c = 26$.  Therefore,  the perimeter is $10+24+26=\\boxed{60}$."
