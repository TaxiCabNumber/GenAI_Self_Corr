At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStephan has been busy at work writing all the possible rearrangements of the letters in his name. He is one bored boy. If he can write twelve rearrangements of his name every minute, how many hours does it take to write all the possible rearrangements of his name?",
        "inference": "First, we calculate the number of arrangements of the letters in Stephan's name by finding the factorial of the number of letters:\n$$\\frac{7!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{5040}{8} = 630.$$\n\nThen we calculate the number of minutes it takes to write all the arrangements:\n$$\\frac{630}{12} = 52.5.$$\n\nFinally, we convert the time to hours:\n$$\\frac{52.5}{60} = 0.875.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.875$}.

        "ground_truth": "Stephan does not have any repeated letters in his name. Therefore, his name can be rearranged in $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 5,\\!040$ ways. Then, we are given that he can write $12$ of these rearrangements every minute. Therefore, it takes him $\\dfrac{5,\\!040}{12} = 420$ minutes to write all the possible rearrangements. Finally, there are $60$ minutes in an hour, so we have: $$420\\text{ minutes} = \\dfrac{420}{60}\\text{ hours} = \\boxed{7\\text{ hours}.}$$"
