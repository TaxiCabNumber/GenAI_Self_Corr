At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 11:00 a.m. how many degrees are in the smaller angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand of the clock?",
        "inference": "The hour hand moves one complete circle (360 degrees) in 12 hours. So, in 1 hour it moves \\frac{360}{12} = 30 degrees.\n\nThe minute hand moves one complete circle (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. So, in 1 minute it moves \\frac{360}{60} = 6 degrees.\n\nAt 11:00 a.m., the hour hand has moved 11 hours from the 12 o'clock position. So, it has moved 11 * 30 = 330 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nAt 11:00 a.m., the minute hand has moved 0 minutes from the 12 o'clock position. So, it has moved 0 * 6 = 0 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe smaller angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand is the difference between the angles they have moved from the 12 o'clock position. So, the smaller angle is 330 - 0 = 330 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$330$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The minute hand is pointing directly at the 12 and the hour hand is pointing directly at the 11.  Therefore, the angle they form is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{1}{12}\\times 360^\\circ=\\boxed{30}$ degrees."
