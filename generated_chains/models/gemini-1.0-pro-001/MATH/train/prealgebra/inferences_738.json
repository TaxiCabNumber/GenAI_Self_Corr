At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 200 students enrolled at Memorial Middle School. Seventy of the students are in band and 95 are in chorus. If only 150 students are in band and/or chorus, how many students are in both band and chorus?",
        "inference": "Let's define the following events:\n\n- B: a student is in band\n- C: a student is in chorus\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n- P(B) = 70/200 = 7/20\n- P(C) = 95/200 = 19/40\n- P(B or C) = 150/200 = 3/4\n\nWe want to find P(B and C). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have:\n\nP(B or C) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B and C)\n3/4 = 7/20 + 19/40 - P(B and C)\nP(B and C) = 7/20 + 19/40 - 3/4\nP(B and C) = 14/40 + 19/40 - 30/40\nP(B and C) = 33/40 - 30/40\nP(B and C) = 3/40\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3/40}$** I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Adding the number of students in the band and the number of students in the chorus gives $70+95 = 165$.  But we are told that there are only 150 students in band and/or chorus, so our 165 must count $165-150 = 15$ students twice, once for the band and once for the chorus.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{15}$ students in both."
