At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour fair coins are to be flipped. What is the probability that all four will be heads or all four will be tails? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
