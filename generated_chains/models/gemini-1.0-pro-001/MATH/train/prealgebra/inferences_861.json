At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe bottoms of two vertical poles are 12 feet apart and are on a region of flat ground. One pole is 6 feet tall and the other is 15 feet tall. How long, in feet, is a wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole?",

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs, so we have \n$$9^2+12^2=x^2$$\n\n3.
