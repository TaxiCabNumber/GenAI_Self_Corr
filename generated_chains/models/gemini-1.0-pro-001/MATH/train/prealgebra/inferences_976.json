At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKeiko tosses one penny and Ephraim tosses two pennies. What is the probability that Ephraim gets the same number of heads that Keiko gets?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The only way for Ephraim to get the same number of heads as Keiko is if Keiko gets 1 head and Ephraim gets 1 head or if Keiko gets 0 heads and Ephraim gets 0 heads.\n\n4. The probability of Keiko getting 1 head is 1/2.\n\n5. The probability of Ephraim getting 1 head is 1/2.\n\n6. The probability of Keiko getting 0 heads is 1/2.\n\n7. The probability of Ephraim getting 0 heads is 1/2.\n\n8. So, the probability of Ephraim getting the same number of heads as Keiko is 1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{2}$}. I hope it is correct.",
