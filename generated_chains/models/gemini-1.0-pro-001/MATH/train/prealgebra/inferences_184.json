At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible median for the five number set        $\\{x, 2x, 3, 2, 5\\}$ if $x$ can be any integer?",
        "inference": "1. Order the set: $\\{2, 3, x, 2x, 5\\}$\n2. The median is the middle value of the set. Since there are five numbers, the median is the third number.\n3. So, the median is $x$.\n4. The largest possible value of $x$ is $4$.\n5. Therefore, the largest possible median is $\\boxed{4}$.\n**Final Answer: $4$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The median is the number in the set with half the other numbers larger than it and half the others smaller. To maximize the median, we need to make $x$ as large as possible, so the items $x$ and $2x$ are as large as possible. Then, the median is $\\boxed{5}$, since 3 and 2 (half the other members) are smaller than it and $x$ and $2x$ are larger than it."
