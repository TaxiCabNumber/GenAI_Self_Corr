At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA coin is flipped eight times, and the sequence of heads and tails occurring is recorded. How many distinct sequences are possible?",
        "inference": "For each flip of the coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.\nSince the coin is flipped eight times, the total number of possible outcomes is $2^8 = 256$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{256}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each flip can result in either a heads or a tails. Thus, there are two choices for each flip. Since there are eight flips total, $2^8 = \\boxed{256}$ distinct sequences are possible."
