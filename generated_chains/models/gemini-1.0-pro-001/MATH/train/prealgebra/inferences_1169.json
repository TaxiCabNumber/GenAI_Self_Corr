At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile standing in line to buy concert tickets, Kit moved 60 feet closer to the ticket window over a period of 30 minutes. At this rate, how many minutes will it take her to move the remaining 70 yards to the ticket window?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 70 yards to feet: 70 * 3 = 210 feet.\n\n2. Calculate the rate at which Kit is moving in feet per minute: 60 feet / 30 minutes = 2 feet / minute.\n\n3. Divide the remaining distance by the rate to find the time it will take: 210 feet / 2 feet / minute = 105 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{105}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "She moved 60 feet in 30 minutes, meaning her rate is $\\frac{60}{30} = 2$ feet per minute.  She has $70\\cdot 3 = 210$ feet remaining, meaning she will need $\\frac{210}{2} = \\boxed{105}$ more minutes."
