At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measure of the angles of a pentagon are in the ratio of 3:3:3:4:5. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the largest angle?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the measures of the angles are in the ratio $3:3:3:4:5$, their measures are $3x, 3x, 3x, 4x$, and $5x$ for some value of $x$. The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have  \\[3x+3x+3x+4x+5x = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying the left side gives $18x = 540^\\circ$, so $x = 30^\\circ$, and the measure of the largest angle is $5x = 5(30^\\circ) = \\boxed{150^\\circ}$."
