At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree positive integers have an arithmetic mean of 26 and median of 27. If the median is 5 less than the largest number, what is the smallest number?",
        "inference": "Let the three positive integers be x, y, and z.\n\nWe are given that the arithmetic mean is 26, so we have:\n$$\\frac{x+y+z}{3} = 26$$\n$$x+y+z = 78$$\n\nThe median is 27, which means that y = 27.\n\nWe are also given that the median is 5 less than the largest number, so we have:\n$$z = y+5 = 32$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is x. We can solve for x by using the equation x+y+z = 78:\n$$x+27+32 = 78$$\n$$x = 29$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The median of three integers is the middle integer. So the middle integer is $27$ and the largest integer is $27+5=32$. We also know that if the mean is $26$, then the sum of the three numbers is $26\\times3=78$. We subtract the other two numbers to find that the third number is $78-27-32=\\boxed{19}$."
