At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a set of five consecutive integers, the largest integer is less than twice the average of the five integers. What is the smallest integer that could be in the set?",
        "inference": "Let's say the smallest integer in the set is x. Then the next four integers are x+1, x+2, x+3, and x+4. Since the largest integer is less than twice the average of the five integers, we have:\nx+4<2(x+x+1+x+2+x+3+x+4)/5\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\nx+4<2(5x+10)/5\nx+4<2x+4\nx<2x\nx<0\nSince x is an integer, the smallest integer that could be in the set is $\\boxed{-1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$ and $n+4$.  Their average is $n+2$, so we have $$n+4<2(n+2) \\Rightarrow n+4<2n+4 \\Rightarrow 0<n.$$Thus $n$ is at least $\\boxed{1}$."
