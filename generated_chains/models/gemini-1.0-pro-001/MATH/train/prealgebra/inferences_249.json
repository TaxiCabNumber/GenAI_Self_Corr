At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many numbers can you get by multiplying two or more distinct members of the set $\\{1,2,3,5,11\\}$ together?",
        "inference": "We can list all the possible pairs of distinct members of the set:\n\n$$(1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(1,11),(2,3),(2,5),(2,11),(3,5),(3,11),(5,11)$$\n\nWe can then multiply each pair together to get the following set of products:\n\n$$2,3,5,11,6,10,22,15,33,55$$\n\nThere are 10 distinct products in this set.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that, because two or more members can be multiplied, multiplying by $1$ will only make a difference if it is one of two numbers. Thus, multiplying by $1$ adds four potential numbers.\n\nNow, we only need to consider the number of combinations that can be made from $2$, $3$, $5$, and $11$.\n\nChoosing two from this set offers six possiblities: $2 \\cdot 3$, $2 \\cdot 5$, $2 \\cdot 11$, $3 \\cdot 5$, $3 \\cdot 11$, and $5 \\cdot 11$.\n\nChoosing three offers four possibilities: $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$, $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$, $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, and $3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$.\n\nFinally, there is one possibility with four chosen: $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$. Thus, there are $4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{15}$."
