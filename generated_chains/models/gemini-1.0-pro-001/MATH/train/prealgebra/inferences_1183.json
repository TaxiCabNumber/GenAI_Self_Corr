(Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2.)",
        "inference": "Let $G$ be Greg's score and $S$ be Sarah's score.\n\nThen, Sarah's score was 40 points more than Greg's, so $S=G+40$\n\nAnd, the average of their two scores was 102, so $\\frac{G+S}{2}=102$\n\nSubstitute $S=G+40$ into the second equation:\n\n$\\frac{G+(G+40)}{2}=102$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$\\frac{2G+40}{2}=102$\n\n$2G+40=204$\n\nSubtract 40 from both sides:\n\n$2G=164$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n$G=82$\n\nSubstitute $G$ back into $S=G+40$:\n\n$S=82+40$\n\n$S=122$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{122}$.

        "ground_truth": "The average of their scores is halfway between their scores.  Thus, since their scores differ by 40, and Sarah's score is higher, her score is $102+\\frac{40}{2} = \\boxed{122}$.\n\nYou can do this more precisely by calling Sarah's score $x$, and Greg's score is therefore $x - 40$.  Taking an average: $x - 20 = 102$, and thus, $x = 122$."
