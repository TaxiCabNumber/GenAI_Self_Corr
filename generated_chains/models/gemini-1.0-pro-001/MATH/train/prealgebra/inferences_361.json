At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAcme Corporation has released an alphabet soup in which each of the vowels (A, E, I, O, U) of the English alphabet appears five times (and the consonants do not appear at all). How many five-letter words can be formed from a bowl of Acme Vowel Soup? (Note: The words do not have to be actual words in English!)",
        "inference": "There are 5 choices for the first letter, 5 choices for the second letter, 5 choices for the third letter, 5 choices for the fourth letter, and 5 choices for the fifth letter.\nSo, the number of five-letter words that can be formed is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^5 = 3125$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$3125$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Clearly there are 5 choices for the first letter. Although it is tempting to think that there are 4 choices for the second letter, reading the problem carefully, we see that in the process of picking our five letters, we will never run out of any of our vowels, since there are five sets of each vowel. Therefore, we just multiply 5 by itself five times to get $5^5 = \\boxed{3125}.$"
