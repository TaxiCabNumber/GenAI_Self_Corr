        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne interior angle of a convex polygon is 160 degrees. The rest of the interior angles of the polygon are each 112 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with n sides is (n-2) * 180 degrees. So, for a polygon with n sides, we have:\n\n(n-2) * 180 = 160 + (n-2) * 112\n180n - 360 = 160 + 112n - 224\n180n - 112n = 160 - 224\n68n = -64\nn = -64/68\nn = -8/9\n\nSince the number of sides of a polygon cannot be negative, the given interior angles are not possible for any convex polygon.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{No Possible Solution}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let us call $x$ the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of all the angles of the polygon with $x$ sides is $180(x-2)$, but with the information given, it can also be expressed as $160 + 112(x-1)$.  Therefore, setting these two equations equal: \\begin{align*}\n180(x-2) &= 160 + 112(x-1)\\\\\n180x - 360 &= 160 + 112x - 112\\\\\n68x &= 408\\\\\nx &= 6\\\\\n\\end{align*} Thus, it has $\\boxed{6}$ sides, and is a hexagon."
