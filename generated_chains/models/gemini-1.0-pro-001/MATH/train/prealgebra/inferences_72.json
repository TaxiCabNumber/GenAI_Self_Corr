        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\\circ$.  Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\\circ) = 90^\\circ$.  Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\\circ = 90^\\circ$, so $5x = 85^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{17^\\circ}$."
