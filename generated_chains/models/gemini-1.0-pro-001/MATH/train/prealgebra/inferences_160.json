At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive toppings for a pizza are available at Polina's Pizza. How many combinations of two different toppings are possible?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThere are 5 choices for the first topping. For each of these choices, there are 4 choices for the second topping (since we want different toppings). So, there are $5\\times4=20$ combinations of two different toppings.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 options for the first topping and 4 options left for the second topping for a preliminary count of $5\\cdot4=20$ options. However, the order in which we put the toppings on doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{5\\cdot4}{2}=\\boxed{10}$ combinations."
