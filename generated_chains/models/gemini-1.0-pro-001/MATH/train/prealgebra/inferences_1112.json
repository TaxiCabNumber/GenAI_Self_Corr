At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe $\\$4.55$ in Carol's piggy bank consists of quarters and nickels. There are seven more nickels than quarters. How many nickels does Carol have in her bank?",
        "inference": "Let $q$ be the number of quarters and $n$ be the number of nickels.\n\nWe know that:\n\n$q + n = 4.55$\n\nWe also know that:\n\n$n = q + 7$\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\n$q + (q + 7) = 4.55$\n\n$2q + 7 = 4.55$\n\n$2q = 4.55 - 7$\n\n$2q = -2.45$\n\n$q = -2.45/2$\n\n$q = -1.225$\n\nThis is not a valid solution, as we cannot have a negative number of quarters.

        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ and $q$ represent the respective numbers of nickels and quarters. Since there are seven more nickels than quarters, we know that $q=n-7$. In cents, the amount of money Carol has is $5n+25q=455$. We substitute the expression of $q$ in terms of $n$ from the first equation into the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n5n+25(n-7)&=455\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5(n-7)&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5n-35&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6n&=126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&=21\n\\end{align*} Carol has $\\boxed{21}$ nickels in her piggy bank."
