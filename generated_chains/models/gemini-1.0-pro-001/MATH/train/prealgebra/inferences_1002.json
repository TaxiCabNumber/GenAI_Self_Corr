        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4?  (A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, like 61216.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1:** A four-digit palindrome must be in the form of $1001a$, where $a$ is the digit in the tens place.\n\n**Step 2:** For a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits must be divisible by 4. Therefore, $1001a$ must have $01a$ divisible by 4. The only possible values of $a$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\n**Step 3:** We want to find the smallest palindrome, so we choose the smallest possible value of $a$, which is 0.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{10010}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Every four-digit palindrome is of the form $ABBA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits.  The four-digit number $ABBA$ is divisible by 4 if and only if the two-digit number $BA$ is divisible by 4.  In particular, the digit $A$ must be even.\n\nSince $ABBA$ is a four-digit number, $A$ cannot be 0, so $A$ must be at least 2.  For $A = 2$, so the smallest digit $B$ for which $BA = B2$ is divisible by 4 is 12.  Therefore, the smallest smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4 is $\\boxed{2112}$."
