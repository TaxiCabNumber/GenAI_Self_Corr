        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe median of the set of numbers $\\{$12, 38, 45, $x$, 14$\\}$ is five less than the mean. If $x$ is a negative integer, what is the value of $x$?",
        "inference": "We can start by finding the mean of the set of numbers. The mean is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers. In this case, the mean is:\n\n$$\\frac{12+38+45+x+14}{5}=\\frac{109+x}{5}$$\n\nNext, we can find the median of the set of numbers. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order from least to greatest. In this case, we can arrange the numbers as:\n\n$$x<12<14<38<45$$\n\nSo, the median is 14.\n\nWe are told that the median is five less than the mean, so we can write:\n\n$$14=\\frac{109+x}{5}-5$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$14=\\frac{109+x}{5}-5$$\n\n$$14+\\frac{109+x}{5}=5$$\n\n$$\\frac{109+x}{5}=5-14$$\n\n$$\\frac{109+x}{5}=-9$$\n\n$$109+x=-45$$\n\n$$x=-154$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is -154.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-154}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $x$ is negative, the median of the set is 14.  Therefore, the mean of the set is $14+5=19$, and its sum is $19\\cdot 5=95$.  Since 12, 38, 45, and 14 sum to 109, the remaining integer $x$ must be $95-109=\\boxed{-14}$."
