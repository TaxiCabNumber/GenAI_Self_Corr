        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConvex hexagon $ABCDEF$ has exactly two distinct side lengths. Side $AB$ measures 5 units, and side $BC$ measures 6 units. The perimeter of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 34 units. How many sides of hexagon $ABCDEF$ have measure 6 units?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** Since the perimeter of the hexagon is 34 units, the sum of the lengths of the six sides is 34 units. The lengths of two of the sides are 5 and 6 units. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the remaining four sides is 34 - 5 - 6 = 23 units. Since the lengths of the sides of the hexagon can only be 5 or 6 units, the only way to obtain a sum of 23 units is if the lengths of three of the sides are 6 units and the length of the remaining side is 5 units. Therefore, hexagon $ABCDEF$ has $\\boxed{3}$ sides of measure 6 units.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If all sides measured $6$ units, the total perimeter would be $36$.  But this is $2$ too many units, so we must change two of these sides to $5$ units.  Thus $\\boxed{4}$ sides measure $6$ units."
