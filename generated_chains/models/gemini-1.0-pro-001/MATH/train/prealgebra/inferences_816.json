At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average age of the 10 females in a choir is 30 years. The average age of the 15 males in the same choir is 35 years. What is the average age, in years, of the 25 people in the choir?",
        "inference": "**Average age of females** = (10 x 30) = 300 years\n**Average age of males** = (15 x 35) = 525 years\n**Total average age** = 300 + 525 = 825 years\n**Number of people** = 10 + 15 = 25\n**Average age of the choir** = 825 / 25 = 33 years\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $S$ be the sum of the ages of the females. Then $30 = \\frac{S}{10}$ (since the average is the sum divided by the number of elements), so $S = (30)(10)$. Similarly, the sum of the males' ages is $(35)(15)$. So the sum of all the ages is $(30)(10)+(35)(15)$. There are a total of 25 people, so the average is $$\n\\frac{(30)(10)+(35)(15)}{25} = \\boxed{33}.\n$$"
