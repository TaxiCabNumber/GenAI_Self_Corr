At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of cats to dogs at the pet store is 2:3. There are 14 cats. How many dogs are there at the pet store?",
        "inference": "Steps:\n\nIf cats dogs ratio is 2:3\nCat count is 14\nTherefore we can find the dog count in this proportion:\nCat/dog = 2/3\n14/dog = 2/3\ndog = 21\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 dogs for every 2 cats, and there are $14/2=7$ sets of 2 cats.  Therefore, there are $3(7)=\\boxed{21\\text{ dogs}}$."
