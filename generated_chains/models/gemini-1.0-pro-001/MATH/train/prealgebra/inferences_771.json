At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery June 1, an ecologist takes a census of the number of wrens in a state park. She noticed that the number is decreasing by $40\\%$ each year. If this trend continues, in what year will the census show that the number of wrens is less than $10\\%$ of what it was on June 1, 2004?",
        "inference": "**Year 1 (2005):** \n\\(1-0.40=0.60\\) or \\(60\\%\\) of the original number\n\n**Year 2 (2006):** \n\\(0.60(1-0.40)=0.60(0.60)=0.36\\) or \\(36\\%\\)  of the original number\n\n**Year 3 (2007):** \n\\(0.36(1-0.40)=0.36(0.60)=0.216\\) or \\(21.6\\%\\) of the original number\n\n**Year 4 (2008):** \n\\(0.216(1-0.40)=0.216(0.60)=0.1296\\) or \\(12.96\\%\\)  of the original number\n\n**Year 5 (2009):** \n\\(0.1296(1-0.40)=0.1296(0.60)=0.07776\\) or \\(7.78\\%\\) of the original number\n\n**Year 6 (2010):** \n\\(0.07776(1-0.40)=0.07776(0.60)=0.04666\\) or \\(4.67\\%\\) of the original number\n\n**After 6 years, the number of wrens will be less than 10% of what it was on June 1, 2004.**\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2010}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "After one year, there will be $60\\%$ left. After two years, there will be $36\\%$ left. After three years, there will be $21.6\\%$ left.\n\nAs we can see, these are just increasing powers of $60\\%$, the next year will not dip below $10\\%$, because $60\\% > 50\\%$, and $21.6 > 20$.  However, without calculating it exactly, you know that it will be less than $16.6\\%$, and thus, it will take 5 years - meaning that in $\\boxed{2009}$, the total number of wrens will drop below $10\\%$ of what it originally was."
