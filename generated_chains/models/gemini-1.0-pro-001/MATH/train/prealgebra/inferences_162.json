At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the beginning of every period of British Literature, Mrs. Crabapple picks a random student to receive a crabapple as a gift, but really, as you might imagine, they are quite bitter and nasty. Given that there are 11 students in her class and her class meets four times a week, how many different sequences of crabapple recipients are possible in a week?",
        "inference": "The number of different sequences of crabapple recipients in a week is equal to the number of permutations of 11 students taken 4 at a time. \n\nThe formula for the number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is:\n\n```\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n```\n\nwhere n! represents the factorial of n.\n\nIn this case, n = 11 and r = 4, so the number of different sequences of crabapple recipients in a week is:\n\n```\nP(11, 4) = 11! / (11 - 4)! = 11! / 7! = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 = 7920\n```\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7920}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there is no mention that a student cannot be picked twice, there are 11 possible victims every time the class meets. Therefore, our answer is $11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 11 = 11^4 = \\boxed{14,\\!641}.$"
