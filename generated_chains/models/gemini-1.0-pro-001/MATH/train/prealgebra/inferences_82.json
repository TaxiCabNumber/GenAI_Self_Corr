At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many obtuse interior angles are in an obtuse triangle?",
        "inference": "An obtuse triangle is a triangle with one obtuse angle, which is an angle greater than 90 degrees. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. If one angle is obtuse, then the other two angles must be acute, which means they are less than 90 degrees. Therefore, an obtuse triangle has **one** obtuse interior angle.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By definition, an obtuse triangle contains one obtuse interior angle. It cannot contain more than one because an obtuse angle has measure greater than 90 degrees and the sum of all the interior angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, there is $\\boxed{1}$ obtuse angle."
