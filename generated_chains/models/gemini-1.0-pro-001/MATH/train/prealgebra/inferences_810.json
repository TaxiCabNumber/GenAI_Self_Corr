At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that we have an 8-sided die with 4 red faces, 3 yellow faces, and a blue face.  What is the probability of rolling a yellow face?",
        "inference": "The probability of rolling a yellow face is the number of yellow faces divided by the total number of faces.  The number of yellow faces is 3, and the total number of faces is 8.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a yellow face is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 yellow faces and 8 faces total, so the probability of rolling a yellow face is $\\boxed{\\dfrac38}$."
