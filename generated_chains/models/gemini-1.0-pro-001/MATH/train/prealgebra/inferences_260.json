        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many natural numbers between 150 and 300 are divisible by 9?",
        "inference": "Divisible by 9 means the sum of digits is divisible by 9.\nThe sum of the digits of 150 is 1+5+0=6, which is not divisible by 9, so 150 is not divisible by 9.\nThe sum of the digits of 300 is 3+0+0=3, which is divisible by 9, so 300 is divisible by 9.\nLet's list the numbers between 150 and 300 that are divisible by 9:\n153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, 234, 243, 252, 261, 270, 279, 288, 297\nThere are 18 numbers between 150 and 300 that are divisible by 9.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $9$. Thus, the least and greatest numbers in the range from $150$ to $300$ that are divisible by nine are $153$ and $297$.  So, we must count the numbers in the list  \\[9\\cdot 17, 9\\cdot 18, 9\\cdot 19, \\ldots, 9\\cdot 33.\\] This list has the same number of numbers as the list \\[17, 18, 19,\\ldots, 33.\\] Subtracting 16 from each of these gives  \\[1,2,3,\\ldots,17.\\] There are clearly $\\boxed{17}$ numbers in this list."
