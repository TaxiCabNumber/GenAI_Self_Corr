At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven the three digits 2, 4 and 7, how many different positive two-digit integers can be formed using these digits if a digit may not be repeated in an integer?",
        "inference": "There are 3 choices for the tens digit of the two-digit integer. For each of these choices, there are 2 choices for the units digit. So, by the multiplication principle, the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed is $3\\cdot2=6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
