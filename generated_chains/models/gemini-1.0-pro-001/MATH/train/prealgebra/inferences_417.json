At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat integer value of $n$ will satisfy $n + 10 > 11$ and $-4n > -12$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n- For the first inequality, $n + 10 > 11$, we can subtract 10 from both sides to get $n > 1$.\n- For the second inequality, $-4n > -12$, we can divide both sides by $-4$ (reversing the inequality) to get $n < 3$.\nTherefore, $n$ must satisfy both $n > 1$ and $n < 3$. The only integer that satisfies both inequalities is $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the first inequality simplifies it to \\[n>1.\\] To deal with the second inequality, we divide both sides by $-4$, being sure to reverse the inequality sign: \\[n<3.\\]\n\nLuckily, there is only one integer that solves both of these inequalities, namely $\\boxed{2}$."
