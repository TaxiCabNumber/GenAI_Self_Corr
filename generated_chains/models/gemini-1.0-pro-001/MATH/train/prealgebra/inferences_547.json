At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-digit positive integers exist that satisfy the following conditions: (A) Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5, and (B) the last two digits cannot be the same digit, and (C) each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8?",

However, since the last two digits cannot be the same, we must divide by 2. Therefore, the number of 4-digit positive integers that satisfy the given conditions is:\n$$3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4! \\div 2 = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 24 \\div 2 = 36.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$36$}.
