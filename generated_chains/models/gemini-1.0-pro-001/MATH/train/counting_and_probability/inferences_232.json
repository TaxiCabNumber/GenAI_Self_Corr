At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1 to 20. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
        "inference": "There are $20^4 = 160,000$ possible outcomes when four 20-sided dice are rolled.\nThere are $10$ even numbers on each die, so there are $10^4 = 10,000$ outcomes in which all four dice show an even number.\nThere are $10 \\cdot 19^3 = 68,410$ outcomes in which three of the dice show an even number and one die shows an odd number.\nThere are $4 \\cdot 10^2 \\cdot 19^2 = 146,410$ outcomes in which two of the dice show an even number and two dice show an odd number.\nTherefore, the probability of getting exactly two even numbers is:\n$$146,410 / 160,000 = 0.9150625$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.9150625$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{16}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$."
