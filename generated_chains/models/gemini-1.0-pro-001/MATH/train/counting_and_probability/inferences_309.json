        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two colors Jessica can use to color this 2 by 2 grid. If non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, how many possible ways are there for Jessica to color the grid?\n\n[asy]\nsize(101);\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((0,.5)--(1,.5));\ndraw((.5,0)--(.5,1));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1),NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1),NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0),SW);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 4 regions in the grid, labeled A, B, C, and D. If Jessica colors region A with the first color, then she has two options for coloring region B. Once she colors region B, she has only one option for coloring region C, since it cannot be the same color as region B. Then she has only one option for coloring region D.\n\nIf Jessica colors region A with the second color, then she has two options for coloring region B. Once she colors region B, she has only one option for coloring region C, since it cannot be the same color as region B. Then she has only one option for coloring region D.\n\nTherefore, there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 4$ possible ways for Jessica to color the grid.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Because non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, the only way to color the grid is to have diagonal squares sharing the same color. So, Jessica can either color the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$ and the top right and bottom left squares with color $2$, or color the top left and bottom right squares with color $2$ and the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ ways in which to color the grid."
