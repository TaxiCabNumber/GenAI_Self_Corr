At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nErika, who is 14 years old, flips a fair coin whose sides are labeled 10 and 20, and then she adds the number on the top of the flipped coin to the number she rolls on a standard die. What is the probability that the sum equals her age in years? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability that the coin lands on 10 is 1/2, and the probability that it lands on 20 is also 1/2.\nThe probability that the die rolls a number from 1 to 4 is 4/6, while the probability that it rolls a 5 or a 6 is 2/6.\nThe sum of the coin flip and the die roll will equal 14 if the coin lands on 10 and the die rolls a 4, or if the coin lands on 20 and the die rolls a 6.\n\nThe probability of the first event is (1/2) * (4/6) = 2/6.\nThe probability of the second event is (1/2) * (2/6) = 1/6.\n\nThe probability of either event occurring is the sum of the probabilities of the individual events, which is 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/2}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "The only way for the sum to be a 14 is for her coin flip to be a 10 and for her roll to be a 4. This can only occur in $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
