I hope it is correct.'\nAfter a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
        "inference": "Let m be the number of gymnasts on the team with the coach, and n be the number of gymnasts on the other team. The gymnasts on the team with the coach shook hands with each other, which is $\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ handshakes. The gymnasts on the team with the coach shook hands with the gymnasts on the other team, which is $mn$ handshakes. The gymnasts on the other team shook hands with each other, which is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ handshakes. The coach shook hands with $m$ gymnasts on her team, which is $m$ handshakes. The total number of handshakes is 281, so:\n\n$$\\frac{m(m-1)}{2} + mn + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + m = 281$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$m^2 + mn + n^2 + 2m = 562$$\n\n$$m^2 + 2m + 1 + mn + n^2 - 1 = 562$$\n\n$$(m+1)^2 + mn + n^2 = 562$$\n\nFactoring:\n\n$$(m+n+8)(m+n-70) = 0$$\n\nSince $m$ and $n$ are positive, we have $m+n=70$. The fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in is when $m=69$ and $n=1$, which is $\\boxed{69}$.\nFinal Answer: $69$",
        "ground_truth": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$."
