At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips?",
        "inference": "Assuming the coin is fair, the probability of getting heads on any given flip is 1/2. The probability of getting tails on any given flip is also 1/2.\n\nThe probability of getting heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips is the complement of the probability of getting heads in 7 or fewer of the 10 flips.\n\nThe probability of getting heads in 7 or fewer of the 10 flips can be calculated using the binomial distribution:\n\n```\nP(X \u2264 7) = \u03a3(k=0 to 7) (10 choose k) * (1/2)^k * (1/2)^(10-k)\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* X is the random variable representing the number of heads in 10 flips\n* k is the number of heads in 10 flips\n* (10 choose k) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k heads from 10 flips\n\nEvaluating this sum, we get:\n\n```\nP(X \u2264 7) = 0.9922\n```\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips is:\n\n```\n1 - P(X \u2264 7) = 1 - 0.9922 = 0.0078\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{0.0078}.

        "ground_truth": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The number of ways to get 8, 9, or 10 heads is $\\binom{10}{8}+\\binom{10}{9}+\\binom{10}{10}=45+10+1=56$.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{56}{1024}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{128}}$."
