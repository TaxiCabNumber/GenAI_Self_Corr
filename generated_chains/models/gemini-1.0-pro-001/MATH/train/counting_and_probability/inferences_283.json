At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMatt's four cousins are coming to visit. There are four identical rooms that they can stay in. If any number of the cousins can stay in one room, how many different ways are there to put the cousins in the rooms?",
        "inference": "There are 5 options for the number of cousins staying in the first room: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each of these options, there are 5 options for the number of cousins staying in the second room. This gives a total of $5 \\times 5 = 25$ options for the number of cousins staying in the first two rooms. For each of these options, there are 5 options for the number of cousins staying in the third room. This gives a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$ options for the number of cousins staying in the first three rooms. Finally, for each of these options, there is only one option for the number of cousins staying in the fourth room. This gives a total of $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 1 = 125$ different ways to put the cousins in the rooms.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{125}$. I hope it is correct.",

There are $3$ ways to choose which of the other cousins will also stay in that room, and then the other two are automatically in the other room.\n\n(2,1,1,0): There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which cousins stay the same room.\n\n(1,1,1,1): There is one way for all the cousins to each stay in a different room.\n\nThe total number of possible arrangements is $1+4+3+6+1=\\boxed{15}$."
