At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many four-digit positive integers have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3?",
        "inference": "The number of four-digit positive integers with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 is equal to the total number of four-digit positive integers minus the number of four-digit positive integers with no 2s or 3s.\n\nThe total number of four-digit positive integers is $10^4 = 10000$.\n\nTo find the number of four-digit positive integers with no 2s or 3s, we can use the multiplication principle. There are 8 choices for the first digit (since it cannot be 0), 9 choices for the second digit (since it cannot be 0 or the same as the first digit), 8 choices for the third digit (since it cannot be 0, 2, or 3), and 7 choices for the fourth digit (since it cannot be 0, 2, or 3 and must be different from the first three digits). Therefore, the number of four-digit positive integers with no 2s or 3s is $8 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 4032$.\n\nTherefore, the number of four-digit positive integers with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 is $10000 - 4032 = \\boxed{5968}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5968}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3."
