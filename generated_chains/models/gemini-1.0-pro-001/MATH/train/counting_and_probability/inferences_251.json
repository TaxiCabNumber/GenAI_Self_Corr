At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThere are $5$ choices for the first letter, $5$ choices for the second letter, $5$ choices for the third letter, and $5$ choices for the fourth letter. However, if the first letter is a vowel, then the second letter must be a consonant, so there are only $3$ choices for the second letter. Similarly, if the second letter is a vowel, then the third letter must be a consonant, so there are only $3$ choices for the third letter. And if the third letter is a vowel, then the fourth letter must be a consonant, so there are only $3$ choices for the fourth letter.\n\nTherefore, the total number of words is $5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5-5\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot5-5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot3+5\\cdot5\\cdot3\\cdot3=\\boxed{625}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{625}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$."
