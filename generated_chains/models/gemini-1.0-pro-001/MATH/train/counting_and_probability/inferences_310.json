At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of ways he can choose two socks.**\nTotal socks = 10 gray + 8 white = 18 socks\nNumber of ways to choose 2 socks = 18C2 = 153\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of ways he can choose a matching pair.**\nNumber of matching pairs = 10 gray pairs + 8 white pairs = 18 pairs\nNumber of ways to choose a matching pair = 18C2 = 153\n\n**Step 3: Divide the number of ways to choose a matching pair by the total number of ways to choose two socks.**\nProbability of choosing a matching pair = 153 / 153 = 1\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$."
