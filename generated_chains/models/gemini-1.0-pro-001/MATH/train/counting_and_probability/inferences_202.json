At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 5 blue chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag. A second chip is then drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**1st draw:**\n- There are 8 chips to choose from (5 blue and 3 yellow).\n- The probability of choosing a blue chip is 5/8.\n- The probability of choosing a yellow chip is 3/8.\n\n**2nd draw:**\n- The probability of choosing a chip of a different color than the first chip is:\n  - If the first chip was blue, the probability of choosing a yellow chip is 3/8.\n  - If the first chip was yellow, the probability of choosing a blue chip is 5/8.\n\n**Overall probability:**\n- The probability of choosing two chips of different colors is the product of the probabilities of each draw:\n  - P(blue, yellow) = (5/8) * (3/8) = 15/64\n  - P(yellow, blue) = (3/8) * (5/8) = 15/64\n- The overall probability is the sum of these probabilities:\n  - P(different colors) = 15/64 + 15/64 = 30/64\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{30}{64}$. I hope it is correct.}",
        "ground_truth": "If we draw a blue chip and then a yellow chip, or if we draw a yellow chip and then a blue chip, then our draws will be different colors. So, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{15}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{32}}$."
