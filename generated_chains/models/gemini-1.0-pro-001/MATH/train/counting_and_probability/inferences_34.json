At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the last two digits of the following sum: $$5! + 10! + 15! + \\cdots + 100!$$",
        "inference": "The last two digits of $n!$ are 00 if n is greater than or equal to 20, and is n if n is less than or equal to 19.  Therefore, we need to consider only the last two digits of $5!, 10!, and 15!$.  The last two digits of $5!$ are 00, the last two digits of $10!$ are 00, and the last two digits of $15!$ are 00.\n\nTherefore, the last two digits of the sum are **00**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$00$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since for all $n \\ge 10$, $n!$ has (at least) two factors of 5, we know that $n!$ will end in two zeros.  Therefore, if $n\\ge 10$, then $n!$ contributes nothing to the last two digits of the sum. So we need only compute $5! = 120$, and hence our answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
