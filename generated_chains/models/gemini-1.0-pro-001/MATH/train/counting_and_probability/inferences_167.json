        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of different gender?",
        "inference": "The president can be chosen in 10 ways (10 boys). The vice-president must be a girl, and can be chosen in 10 ways (10 girls). Therefore, the number of ways to choose a president and a vice-president of different gender is:\n\n$10 \\times 10 = 100$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 10 members of the opposite sex. The answer is $20\\times 10=\\boxed{200}$."
