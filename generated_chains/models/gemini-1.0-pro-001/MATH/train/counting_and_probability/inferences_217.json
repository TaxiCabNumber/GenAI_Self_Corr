At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits $1,2,3,4$ and $5$ can be arranged to form many different $5$-digit positive integers with five distinct digits. In how many such integers is the digit $1$ to the left of the digit $2$?  (The digits 1 and 2 do not have to be next to each other.)",
        "inference": "Since the digit $1$ is to the left of the digit $2$, we can consider the digits $1$ and $2$ as one block. Then we have $4$ digits left, which can be arranged in $4! = 24$ ways. The block of digits $1$ and $2$ can be arranged in $2$ ways. Therefore, the total number of such integers is:\n\n$$2 \\times 24 = \\boxed{48}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the first digit, we have 5 choices, then we have 4 choices left for the second digit, then 3 choices for the third digit, etc. So there are $5!=120$ arrangements of the digits. Notice that for each arrangement with 1 to the left of 2, we can reverse the arrangement so that 2 is to the left of 1. For instance, flipping 31245 results in 54213. So by symmetry, exactly half of the arrangements have 1 to the left of 2. In $\\frac{120}{2}=\\boxed{60}$ integers, the digit 1 is to the left of the digit 2."
