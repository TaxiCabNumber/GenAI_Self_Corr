At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of diagonals of a regular polygon is subtracted from the number of sides of the polygon and the result is zero. What is the number of sides of this polygon?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of sides of the polygon.\n\nThe number of diagonals of a regular polygon with $n$ sides is $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}=n-4$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$n^2-3n=2n-8$$ $$n^2-5n+8=0$$\n\nFactoring this quadratic equation, we get:\n\n$$(n-2)(n-4)=0$$\n\nSo, $n=2$ or $n=4$.\n\nA regular polygon cannot have 2 sides, so the only possible number of sides is $n=4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the polygon have $n$ sides. The number of diagonals then is $n(n-3)/2$, because each vertex is connected to $n-3$ other vertices by diagonals, but $n(n-3)$ counts each diagonal twice.  We then have $$n=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\implies 1=\\frac{n-3}{2}\\implies n=\\boxed{5}$$"
