        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n* We can start by placing the four even digits (2, 4) in the even positions, and the three odd digits (1, 3, 5) in the odd positions.\n\n\n* This gives us: (_e_ _e_ _o_ _e_ _o_), where _e_ represents an even digit and _o_ represents an odd digit.\n\n\n* There are 4 choices for the first even digit.\n\n\n* There are 3 choices for the second even digit (since it can't be the same as the first).\n\n\n* There are 3 choices for the first odd digit (since it can't be the same as the even digit before it). \n\n\n* There are 2 choices for the second odd digit (since it can't be the same as the odd digit before it).\n\n\n* So, the total number of combinations is: 4 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 144.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{$144$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations."
