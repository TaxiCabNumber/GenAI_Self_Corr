At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are positive integers that have these properties:\n\n$\\bullet$ I. The sum of the squares of their digits is $50,$ and\n\n$\\bullet$ II. Each digit is larger than the one on its left.\n\nWhat is the product of the digits of the largest integer with both properties?",
        "inference": "List all 2-digit numbers whose digits sum to 50. \n\n$19,28,37,46,$\n\nSince each digit must be greater than the one on its left, that eliminates 19, 28, and 46. That leaves only $37$\n\nAnd so the product of the digits is $3 \\times 7 = \\boxed{21}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To meet the first condition, numbers which sum to $50$ must be chosen from the set of squares $\\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\\}.$ To meet the second condition, the squares selected must be different. Consequently, there are three possibilities: $1+49,$ $1+4+9+36,$ and $9+16+25.$ These correspond to the integers $17,$ $1236,$ and $345,$ respectively. The largest is $1236,$ and the product of its digits is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot6=\\boxed{36}.$"
