At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

This is a problem of combinations with repetitions and can be solved using the formula:\n\nWays = (n + r - 1)! / (n! * (r - 1)!)\n\nwhere n is the number of balls, and r is the number of boxes.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nWays = (5 + 3 - 1)! / (5! * (3 - 1)!)\n= (7)! / (5! * 2!)\n= 210 / 120\n= 1.75\n\nBut the answer must be an integer, so there are 2 ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable but the boxes are.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$2$}.
