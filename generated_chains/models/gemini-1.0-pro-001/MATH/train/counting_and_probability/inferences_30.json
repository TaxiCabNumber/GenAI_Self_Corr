At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal?",
        "inference": "For any die, the probability of rolling an even number is 1/2, and the probability of rolling an odd number is 1/2. Since the dice are independent, the probability of rolling any particular combination of even and odd numbers is 1/2^6 = 1/64.  There are 15 combinations of 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers, so the probability of rolling an equal number of even and odd numbers is 15/64.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{ 15 / 64 }$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}$ ways for 3 of the dice to show even numbers and 3 of them to show odd numbers.  Each roll is even with probability $\\frac12$ and odd with probability $\\frac12$, so each arrangement of 3 odd numbers and 3 even number occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!6}$.  Thus, the probability that 3 dice out of 6 show even numbers is \\[\\binom{6}{3}\\frac{1}{2^6}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}.\\]"
