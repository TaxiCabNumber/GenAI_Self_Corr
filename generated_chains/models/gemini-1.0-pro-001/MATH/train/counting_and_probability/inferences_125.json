At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n2 diagonals of a regular heptagon (a 7-sided polygon) are chosen.  What is the probability that they intersect inside the heptagon?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nThere are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways to choose two diagonals.\nThere are 7 vertices, so there are ${7\\choose 2}=21$ ways to choose two vertices.\nThere are 3 diagonals that intersect inside the heptagon, so there are 3 ways to choose two diagonals that intersect inside the heptagon.\nTherefore, the probability that two diagonals of a regular heptagon intersect inside the heptagon is $\\frac{3}{21}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{7}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ pairs of points in the heptagon, and all but 7 (the sides of the heptagon) are diagonals, which means there are 14 diagonals.  So there are $\\binom{14}{2} = 91$ pairs of diagonals.  Any four points on the heptagon uniquely determine a pair of intersecting diagonals. (If vertices $A,B,C,D$ are chosen, where $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral, the intersecting pair of diagonals are $AC$ and $BD$.)  So the number of sets of intersecting diagonals is the number of combinations of 4 points, which is $\\binom{7}{4} = 35$.  So the probability that a randomly chosen pair of diagonals intersect is $\\dfrac{35}{91} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}$."
