At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy grandpa has 10 pieces of art, including 3 prints by Escher. If he hangs the pieces of art in a row in a random order, what is the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively?",
        "inference": "1. **10 items** can be arranged in **10! ways**.\n\n2. **3 specific items** can be arranged in **3! ways**. \n\n3. **Remaining 7 items** can be arranged in **7! ways**. \n\n4. So the total number of arrangements with the 3 Escher prints together is: **3! * 7!**. \n\n5. Therefore, the probability of all three Escher pieces being placed consecutively is: **(3! * 7!) / 10!**\n\n$$= (1*2*3)*1*2*3*4*5*6*7 * 1/1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10$$\n$$= 720/3628800$$\n$$= 1/5040$$\n$$= 0.0001984$$\n$$= 0.01984%$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.01984%$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item. It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways. There are also a total of $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions. Thus the probability that we want is $\\dfrac{8}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}}$."
