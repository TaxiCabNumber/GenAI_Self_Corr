        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a drawer with 4 shirts, 5 pairs of shorts, and 6 pairs of socks in it. If I reach in and randomly remove three articles of clothing, what is the probability that I get one shirt, one pair of shorts, and one pair of socks? (Treat pairs of socks as one article of clothing.)",
        "inference": "The probability of getting a shirt is 4/15 (4 shirts out of a total of 15 clothing items). The probability of getting a pair of shorts after getting a shirt is 5/14 (5 pairs of shorts out of a total of 14 remaining clothing items). The probability of getting a pair of socks after getting a shirt and a pair of shorts is 6/13 (6 pairs of socks out of a total of 13 remaining clothing items). The probability of getting one shirt, one pair of shorts, and one pair of socks is (4/15) x (5/14) x (6/13) = 120/2730 = 4/91. \n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{91}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we can find the denominator of our fraction.  There are a total of $\\dbinom{15}{3}=455$ ways to choose 3 articles of clothing out of 15. To find the numerator, we need to count the number of ways to choose one piece of each type of clothing.  There are 4 ways we can choose a shirt, 5 ways we can choose a pair of shorts, and 6 ways we can choose a pair of socks, making a total of $4\\cdot 5 \\cdot 6=120$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and socks so our final probability is $\\frac{120}{455}=\\boxed{\\frac{24}{91}}$."
