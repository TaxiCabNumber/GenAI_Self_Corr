At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe cards of a standard 52-card deck are dealt out in a circle. What is the expected number of pairs of adjacent cards which are both black? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 26 black cards.\nIn each pair of adjacent cards, exactly one of them is black.\nIf N denotes the number of adjacent pairs of black cards, the number of pairs with a black card is 2 * N. \nThe expected value of 2 * N is 2 * E(N).\nThe probability that a randomly chosen card is black is 1/2.\nIf a particular card is black, the probability that its neighbor is also black is 1/3, since there are 2 black cards among the 3 neighbors.\nOtherwise, the probability that its neighbor is also black is 0.\nThe expected number of neighbors of a randomly chosen black card that are also black is therefore (1/2) * (1/3).\nThe expected number of adjacent pairs of black cards is therefore N = 26 * (1/2) * (1/3) = 13/3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13/3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of pairs of adjacent cards which are both black is equal to the number of black cards which have another black card to their right. For each black card, there is a $\\dfrac{25}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is also black, giving 1 pair, and a $\\dfrac{26}{51}$ chance that the card to its right is red, giving 0 pairs. There are 26 black cards, so the expected value of the number of pairs of adjacent black cards is $$26\\left(\\frac{25}{51}(1)+\\frac{26}{51}(0)\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{650}{51}}$$"
