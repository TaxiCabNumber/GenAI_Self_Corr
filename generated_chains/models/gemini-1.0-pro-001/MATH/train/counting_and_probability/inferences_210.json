At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 3003. How many positive four-digit integers are palindromes?",
        "inference": "There are 10 choices for the first digit, 10 choices for the second digit, and 10 choices for the third digit. But since the last digit must match the first, there is only one choice for the last digit. Thus, there are $10 \\times 10 \\times10= 1000$ four-digit numbers and \n$$1000 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\boxed{100}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Constructing palindromes requires that we choose the thousands digit (which defines the units digit) and the hundreds digit (which defines the tens digit). Since there are 9 choices for the thousands digit, and 10 choices for the hundreds digit, creating $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ palindromes."
