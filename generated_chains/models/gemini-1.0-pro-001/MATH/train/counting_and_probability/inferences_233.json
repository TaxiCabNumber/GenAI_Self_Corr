At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Count the number of three-digit whole numbers that do not have a 7 or a 9 as digits.\n\nThere are 10 possible digits for each of the three positions in a three-digit whole number: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Since we do not want 7's or 9's, we have 8 choices for each position.\n\nSo, the number of three-digit whole numbers without 7's or 9's is $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{512}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers."
