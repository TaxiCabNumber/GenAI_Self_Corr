At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Grammar club has 20 members: 10 boys and 10 girls.  A 4-person committee is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl?",
        "inference": "Let A be the event that the committee has at least one boy, and let B be the event that the committee has at least one girl. Then we want to find the probability of A \u2229 B.\n\nThe probability of selecting a boy is 10/20 = 1/2, and the probability of selecting a girl is 10/20 = 1/2.\n\nThe probability of selecting a committee with no boys is (1/2)^4 = 1/16, and the probability of selecting a committee with no girls is also 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a committee with at least one boy and at least one girl is 1 - (1/16) - (1/16) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$7/8$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys or all girls is $2\\times\\binom{10}{4}=420$. The total number of committees is $\\binom{20}{4}=4845$. Thus the answer is $1-\\dfrac{420}{4845} = \\dfrac{4425}{4845} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{295}{323}}$."
