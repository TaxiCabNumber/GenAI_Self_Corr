Each die can land on any of 6 sides, so there are a total of 6<sup>3</sup> = 216 possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 3** Determine the Number of Favorable Outcomes\n\nThere are 5 favorable outcomes as described in Step 1.\n\n**Step 4** Calculate the Probability\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Number of possible outcomes\n\nProbability = 5 / 216 = 1 / 43.2\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1 / 43.2}$.

There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$.  So, the probability of this case is $3(1/216) = 1/72$.\n\n\nB) The dice are 6, 5, 5.  There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$.
