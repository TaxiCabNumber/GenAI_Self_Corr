        "ground_truth": "In the worst-case scenario, every possible sum is rolled before the same sum is rolled again. The minimum possible sum rolled is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, and the maximum is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$. Every sum in between those two extremes can be created, since the sums are created through adding three of the digits between one and six.
