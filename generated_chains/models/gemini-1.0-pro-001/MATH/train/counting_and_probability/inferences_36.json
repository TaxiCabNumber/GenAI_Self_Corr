At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MADAM.",

However, since there are two A's and two M's, we need to divide by 2!2! = 4 to account for the overcounting of permutations.\n4. Therefore, there are 120 / 4 = 30 ways to arrange the letters of the word MADAM.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $5!$. Then since the M's and the A's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of M's and the arrangements of A's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{30}$."
