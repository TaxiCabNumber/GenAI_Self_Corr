At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLark has forgotten her locker combination. It is a sequence of three numbers, each in the range from 1 to 30, inclusive. She knows that the first number is odd, the second number is even, and the third number is a multiple of 3. How many combinations could possibly be Lark's?",
