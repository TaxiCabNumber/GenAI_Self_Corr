At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are five unmarked envelopes on a table, each with a letter for a different person.  If the mail is randomly distributed to these five people, with each person getting one letter, what is the probability that exactly four people get the right letter?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes.  There are 5! (120) ways to distribute the 5 letters among 5 people.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of outcomes where exactly four people get the right letter.  To do this choose 4 out of the 5 people to get the right letter. There are 5C4 ways to do this.  Then the fifth person must get the wrong letter, which can be done in 4 ways (since there are 4 wrong letters).  So, there are (5C4)(4) = 100 such outcomes.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of exactly four people getting the right letter.  This is just the number of outcomes where exactly four people get the right letter divided by the total number of possible outcomes:  100/120 = 5/6.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{6}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If 4 people get the right letter, then there is only one letter left, and only one person left.  So, the last person will get the right letter, too.  Therefore, it is impossible for exactly four people to get the right letter.  So, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$."
