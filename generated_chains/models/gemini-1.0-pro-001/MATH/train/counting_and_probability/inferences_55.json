        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
        "inference": "<b>Total number of ways to select 2 plates from 9 plates = 9C2 = 36.</b><br>\n<b>Number of ways to select 2 plates of the same color = 5C2 + 4C2 = 10.</b><br>\n<b>Probability of selecting 2 plates of the same color = 10/36 = 5/18.</b><br>\n<b>Final Answer: \\boxed{5/18}. I hope it is correct.</b>",
        "ground_truth": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$."
