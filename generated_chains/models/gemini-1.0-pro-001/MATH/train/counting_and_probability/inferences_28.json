What is the probability that he will get at least one head?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the possible outcomes when tossing three coins.\n\nThere are 2 possibilities for each coin: head (H) or tail (T). Therefore, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTT, TTH, THT, HTT.\n\n**Step 2:** Count the outcomes with at least one head.\n\nThere are 7 outcomes with at least one head: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the probability of getting at least one head.\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\nProbability = 7 / 8\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{7/8}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We compute the probability that Mahmoud flips three tails and subtract from 1. The probability that Mahmoud flips one tail with one coin is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that he flips three tails is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that he gets at least one head is $1- \\frac{1}{8}= \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$."
