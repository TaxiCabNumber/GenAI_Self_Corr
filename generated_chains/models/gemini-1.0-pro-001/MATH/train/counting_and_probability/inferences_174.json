        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The number of ways to choose four horizontal lines out of four is 4C4 = 1.\n**Step 2:** The number of ways to choose four vertical lines out of four is 4C4 = 1.\n**Step 3:** Therefore, the number of ways to choose four lines such that a rectangular region is enclosed is 1 \u00d7 1 = 1.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle."
