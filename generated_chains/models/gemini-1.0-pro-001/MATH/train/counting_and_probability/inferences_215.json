At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers are between $(10.2)^3$ and $(10.3)^3$?",

The maximum integer between $(10.2)^3$ and $(10.3)^3$ is $\\lfloor (10.3)^3 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1092.727 \\rfloor = 1092$. Therefore, the number of integers between $(10.2)^3$ and $(10.3)^3$ is $1092 - 1062 + 1 = \\boxed{31}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $31$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We want to count the integers from the first one greater than $10.2^3$ to the last one less than $10.3^3$. We note that $(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3$ for any $a,b$. Using this expansion for $(10+.2)^3$ and $(10+.3)^3$, we have: \\begin{align*}\n(10+.2)^3&=10^3+300\\cdot .2+30\\cdot .04+.008\\\\\n(10+.3)^3&=10^3+300\\cdot .3+30\\cdot .09+.027\n\\end{align*}We add up, and find the first to be $1061.208$ and the second to be $1092.727$. Thus, we want to count the integers between 1062 and 1092, inclusive; there are $\\boxed{31}$ of these."
