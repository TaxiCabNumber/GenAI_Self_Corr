At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 4 books be selected from a shelf of 6 books if the order in which the books are selected does not matter?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways to select 4 books from a shelf of 6 books without regard to order. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted by C(n, r), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected. In this case, n = 6 and r = 4.\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4! * 2!) = 15\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{15}. I hope it is correct.**",
