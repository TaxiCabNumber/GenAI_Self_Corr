At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ice cream shop offers 6 kinds of ice cream. What is the greatest number of two scoop sundaes that can be made such that each sundae contains two types of ice cream and no two sundaes are the same combination?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince there are 6 types of ice cream and no two sundaes can be the same combination, each type of ice cream can only be used in 3 sundaes. \n\nTherefore, the greatest number of two-scoop sundaes that can be made is $\\boxed{3\\cdot 6 = 18}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $18$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 6 choices of ice cream and each sundae must consist of 2 of them, there are ${6 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{15}$ kinds of two scoop sundaes."
