At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of the same gender?  Assume no one can hold both offices.",
        "inference": "The president and the vice president must be of the same gender, so we can consider two separate cases and multiply the number of choices in each case:\n\nCase 1: Both the president and the vice president are boys.\nThere are 10 ways to choose a president from the 10 boys.\nFor each choice of president, there are 9 ways to choose a vice president from the remaining 9 boys.\nTherefore, there are 10 x 9 = 90 ways to choose a president and a vice president if both are boys.\n\nCase 2: Both the president and the vice president are girls.\nThere are 10 ways to choose a president from the 10 girls.\nFor each choice of president, there are 9 ways to choose a vice president from the remaining 9 girls.\nTherefore, there are 10 x 9 = 90 ways to choose a president and a vice president if both are girls.\n\nMultiplying the number of choices in each case, we get:\n90 x 90 = 8100.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8100}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 9 remaining members of the same sex. The answer is $20\\times 9=\\boxed{180}$."
