At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
        "inference": "First, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the first digit. There are four choices: 2, 2, 9, or 9. Then, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the second digit. There are three choices: 2, 9, or 9. Next, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the third digit. There are two choices: 2 or 9. Finally, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the fourth digit. There is only one choice: 2 or 9. Therefore, the number of different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9 is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 24.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$."
