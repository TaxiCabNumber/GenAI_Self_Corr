At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly two of the triplets are in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "To choose 6 starters with exactly 2 of the triplets, we have 2 cases:\n\nCase 1: We choose Alicia and Amanda as the 2 triplets.\n- We have 11 players left to choose 4 from.\n- Number of ways = 11C4 = 330\n\nCase 2: We choose Alicia and Anna as the 2 triplets.\n- We have 11 players left to choose 4 from.\n- Number of ways = 11C4 = 330\n\nTotal number of ways = 330 + 330 = 660\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{660}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly two of the triplets are in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplets to put in the starting lineup (we can see this by noting that we have 3 choices for which triplet to leave out), and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 4 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{4} = 3 \\times 330= \\boxed{990}$."
