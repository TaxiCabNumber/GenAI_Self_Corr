        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhil has 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in a bag. He removes a marble at random, records the color, puts it back, and then repeats this process until he has withdrawn 6 marbles. What is the probability that exactly three of the marbles that he removes are green? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",
        "inference": "The probability of drawing a green marble is 7/10.\nThe probability of drawing a purple marble is 3/10.\nThe probability of drawing 3 green marbles out of 6 is (7/10)^3 * (3/10)^3\n= 343/1000 * 27/1000\n= 9327/1000000\n= 0.00933\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0.009} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\left( \\frac{7}{10} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{3}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{9261}{1000000}$ probability that 3 particular marbles out of 6 will be green and the rest will be purple. There are also  $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones. Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \\cdot \\frac{9261}{1000000}\\approx \\boxed{.185}$."
