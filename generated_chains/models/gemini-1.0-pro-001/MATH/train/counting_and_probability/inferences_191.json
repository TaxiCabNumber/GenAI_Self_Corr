At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are distinguishable but the boxes are not?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1:** The 5 balls can be distributed into the 2 boxes in the following ways:\n\n* 5 balls in Box 1, 0 balls in Box 2\n* 4 balls in Box 1, 1 ball in Box 2\n* 3 balls in Box 1, 2 balls in Box 2\n* 2 balls in Box 1, 3 balls in Box 2\n* 1 ball in Box 1, 4 balls in Box 2\n* 0 balls in Box 1, 5 balls in Box 2\n\n**Step 2:** Since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to divide by the number of ways to rearrange the boxes. In this case, there are 2 ways: Box 1 can be either the left box or the right box.\n\n**Step 3:** Dividing by the number of ways to rearrange the boxes, we obtain the number of distinct ways to distribute the balls:\n\n```\nNumber of ways = 6 / 2 = 3\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there are 3 possibilities for arrangements of the number of balls in each box.\n\nCase 1: 5 balls in one box, 0 in the other box. We must choose 5 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way.\n\nCase 2: 4 balls in one box, 1 in the other box. We must choose 4 balls to go in one box, which can be done in  $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways.\n\nCase 3: 3 balls in one box, 2 in the other box. We must choose 3 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways.\n\nThis gives us a total of $1 + 5 + 10 = \\boxed{16}$ arrangements."
