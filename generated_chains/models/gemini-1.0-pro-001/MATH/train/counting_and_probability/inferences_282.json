At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRobert likes chocolate milk, so he decides to visit the milk bottling plant every day for a week to get the free samples. Unfortunately for him, the bottling plant sometimes bottles regular milk instead of chocolate milk, so each day the plant has a 2/3 chance of bottling chocolate milk. What is the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days he visits?",
