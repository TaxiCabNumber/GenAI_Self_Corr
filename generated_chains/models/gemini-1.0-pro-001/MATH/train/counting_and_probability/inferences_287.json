At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
        "inference": "First, choose which triplet will be in the starting lineup. There are 3 choices: Alicia, Amanda, or Anna.  Once one triplet is chosen, there are 13 players left to choose from.  To choose 5 starters from the remaining 13 players, there are 13 choose 5 ways.  The total number of ways to choose 6 starters with exactly one triplet in the lineup is 3 * 13 choose 5 = 3 * 1287 = 3861.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3861}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$."
