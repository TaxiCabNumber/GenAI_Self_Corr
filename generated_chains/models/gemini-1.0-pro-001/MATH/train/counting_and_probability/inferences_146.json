At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat three-digit integer is equal to the sum of the factorials of its digits?",
        "inference": "The only possible values for the digit of the hundreds is 1 or 2, since 3! = 6. If it is 2, then the other two digits must sum to 8. There is only one way to do this: 2+6. Thus the number is 266. If the digit of the hundreds is 1, then the sum of the other two digits must be 8, which is only possible if one of them is 4 and the other is 3. So the number is 143.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{143 or 266}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "With a few initial observations, we realize that the hundreds digit cannot be greater than 1, because the digits 5 or 6 are needed to make a 3 digit integer but will not fit with the larger hundreds digit. Clearly one of the digits is 5, to contribute to the sum $120 = 5!$. Then since we have the hundreds digit of 1, $1! = 1$, we need a middle digit. After testing a few, 4 works, since $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1+ 24 + 120 = \\boxed{145}$."
