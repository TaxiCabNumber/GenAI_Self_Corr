        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe three-digit positive integer $N$ has a ones digit of 3. What is the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "For $N$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.\n\nThe ones digit of $N$ is 3, so the sum of its digits can only be divisible by 3 if the sum of the hundreds and tens digits is divisible by 3.\n\nThere are 9 possible values for the hundreds digit and 10 possible values for the tens digit. Of the 90 possible pairs of hundreds and tens digits, 30 have a sum divisible by 3.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3 is 30/90 = 1/3.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
