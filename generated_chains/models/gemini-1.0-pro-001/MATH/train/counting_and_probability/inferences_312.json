At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMax picks two different cards without replacement from a standard 52-card deck. What is the probability that the cards are of different suits?",
        "inference": "Since the deck has 4 suits with 13 cards in each suit, there are $4 \\times 13 = 52$ cards in total.\nThe probability of picking a card of a specific suit is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of picking a card of a different suit is $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of picking two cards of different suits is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{16}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Once Max has chosen the first card, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 39 do not have the same suit as the first chosen card.  Therefore, the probability that the two cards have different suits is $\\dfrac{39}{51} = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}$."
