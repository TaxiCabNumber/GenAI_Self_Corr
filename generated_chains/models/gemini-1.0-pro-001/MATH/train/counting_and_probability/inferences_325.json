        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
        "inference": "The coach can make 0, 1, 2, or 3 substitutions.\n\nIf the coach makes 0 substitutions, there is only 1 way.\n\nIf the coach makes 1 substitution, there are 11 choices for the player to be substituted, and 11 choices for the substitute, for a total of 121 ways.\n\nIf the coach makes 2 substitutions, there are 11 choices for the first player to be substituted, 10 choices for the substitute (since the first player is no longer available), and 11 choices for the second player to be substituted, and 10 choices for the substitute (since the first two players are no longer available), for a total of 1210 ways.\n\nIf the coach makes 3 substitutions, there are 11 choices for the first player to be substituted, 10 choices for the substitute, 9 choices for the second player to be substituted, 8 choices for the substitute, 7 choices for the third player to be substituted, and 6 choices for the substitute, for a total of 7980 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 1 + 121 + 1210 + 7980 = 9312.\n\nThe remainder when 9312 is divided by 1000 is $\\boxed{312}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{312}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$.\nSumming from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\\cdot 10+11^{4}\\cdot 10\\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\\cdot11\\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (10+11\\cdot10\\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away. What is left is $1+11^2=\\boxed{122}$."
