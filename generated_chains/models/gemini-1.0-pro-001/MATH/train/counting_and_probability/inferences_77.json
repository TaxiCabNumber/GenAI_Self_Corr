At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + \\cdots + 1000!$?",
        "inference": "The units digit of $n!$ is the same as the units digit of $n$. For example, $5! = 120$ and the units digit of $120$ is $0$. This is because $5!$ is the product of all the numbers from $1$ to $5$, and the only number in this product that has a non-zero units digit is $5$.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + \\cdots + 1000!$ is the same as the units digit of $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + \\cdots + 1000$.\n\nThe sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $n(n+1)/2$. Therefore, the sum of the first $1000$ positive integers is $1000(1001)/2 = 500500$.\n\nThe units digit of $500500$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",

For all $n \\ge 5$, $n!$ is a multiple of $5!$, which is a multiple of 10, so all for all $n \\ge 5$, the units digit of $n!$ is 0.  This means that the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + \\cdots + 1000!$ is just the units digit of $1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 0 + \\cdots + 0 = 13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
