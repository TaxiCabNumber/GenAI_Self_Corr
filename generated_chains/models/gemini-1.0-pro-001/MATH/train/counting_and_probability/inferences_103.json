At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 3 red marbles and 5 white marbles.  Two marbles are drawn from the bag and not replaced.  What is the probability that the first marble is red and the second marble is white?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of drawing a red marble from 8 marbles.\n\n**P(Red 1st)** = (Number of red marbles) / (Total number of marbles available)\n= 3 / 8\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability of drawing a white marble from 7 marbles (since one marble has already been drawn).\n\n**P(White 2nd)** = (Number of white marbles) / (Total number of marbles available after 1st draw)\n= 5 / 7\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the probabilities for both events to find the probability of both events happening in the given order.\n\n**P(Red 1st and White 2nd)** = (P(Red 1st)) * (P(White 2nd))\n= (3 / 8) * (5 / 7)\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{15}{56}$} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the first is red is $\\dfrac38$.  Now with 7 remaining, the probability that the second is white is $\\dfrac57$. The answer is $\\dfrac38 \\times \\dfrac57 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{56}}$."
