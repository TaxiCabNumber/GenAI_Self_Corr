At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 5 people be seated around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. We can consider one person's seat as fixed.\n2. Then, the number of ways to seat 5 people around a round table is the same as the number of permutations of 4 people.\n3. The number of permutations of 4 people is 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 5 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$."
