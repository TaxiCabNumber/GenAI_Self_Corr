At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many different ways can four students stand in a straight line if two of the students refuse to stand next to each other?",
        "inference": "1st student can be any of the four students. So, 4 choices.\n\n2nd student can be 3 out of the remaining 3 (since two students cannot stand together). So, 3 choices.\n\n3rd student can be 2 out of the remaining 2. So, 2 choices.\n\n4th student can be only 1 out of the remaining 1. So, 1 choice.\n\nHence, by the Multiplication principle, the total number of ways = 4 * 3 *2 * 1 = 24\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will count the number of ways in which the two students do stand next to each other and then subtract that from the total number of ways all four students can stand in a line without the restriction. If the two students stand next to each other, then we can treat them as a block. There are three blocks: two one-student blocks and one two-student block. We can arrange the blocks in $3!=6$ ways, and there are 2 ways to arrange the students within the two-student block, for a total of $6\\cdot2=12$ ways. The total number of ways to arrange all four students in a line without restrictions is $4!=24$ ways. Thus, the number of ways with the restriction is $24-12=\\boxed{12}$ ways."
