At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
        "inference": "The largest $2$-digit prime factor of $n$ is ${n \\over 2^{100} \\cdot 50! \\cdot 50!}$. We can see that this is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$, and the largest $2$-digit factor in this product is $13$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer."
