        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe planning committee at school has 10 members. Exactly four of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
        "inference": "There are 10C4 = 210 ways to choose 4 members from the planning committee.\nSince there are 4 teachers, there are 4C1 = 4 ways to choose at least one teacher.\nTherefore, there are 210 - 4 = 206 distinct subcommittees possible.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{206}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 4 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${10 \\choose 4} = 210$ subcomittees. The number of subcomittees with 0 teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 6 nonteachers, totaling ${6 \\choose 4} = 15$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least 1 teacher is $210 - 15 = \\boxed{195}$."
