        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lottery in our state consists of two drawings.  First, a MegaBall is picked from among 27 numbered balls.  Second, five WinnerBalls are picked from among 44 numbered balls. To win the lottery, you must pick the MegaBall number correctly and also pick the numbers on the five WinnerBalls (but you don't need to get the order right for the WinnerBalls).  What is the probability that the ticket I hold has the winning numbers?",
        "inference": "First, the MegaBall has 27 possible numbers.  The probability of picking the correct MegaBall is thus 1/27.\n\nNext, the five WinnerBalls have 44 possible numbers.  The probability of picking any one of these balls is 1/44.  The probability of picking all five is (1/44)^5\n\nThe probability of picking the correct MegaBall and all five WinnerBalls is (1/27) * (1/44)^5\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1 / 9,367,702}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the MegaBall matches is $\\dfrac{1}{27}$ . The probability that the 5 WinnerBalls match is $\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}$. So my chances of winning are $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{27}\\right)\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\binom{44}{5}}\\right) = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{29,\\!322,\\!216}}$."
