        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix green balls and four red balls are in a bag.  A ball is taken from the bag, its color recorded, then placed back in the bag.  A second ball is taken and its color recorded.  What is the probability the two balls are the same color?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe probability of selecting a green ball on the first draw is 6/10.\nThe probability of selecting a red ball on the second draw is 4/10.\nThe probability of selecting a green ball on both draws is (6/10) * (6/10) = 36/100.\nThe probability of selecting a red ball on both draws is (4/10) * (4/10) = 16/100.\nThe probability of selecting either a green ball or a red ball on both draws is 36/100 + 16/100 = 52/100.\nTherefore, the probability of selecting two balls of the same color is 52/100.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{52/100}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We could have either two greens or two reds. The probability of drawing two greens is $\\left(\\dfrac{6}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{9}{25}$. The probability of drawing two reds is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^{\\!2}=\\dfrac{4}{25}$.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{9}{25} + \\dfrac{4}{25} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{25}}$."
