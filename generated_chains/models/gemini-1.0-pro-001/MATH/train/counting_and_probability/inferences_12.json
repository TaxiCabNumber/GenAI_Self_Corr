At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips?",
        "inference": "The probability of getting heads in a single flip is 1/2. The probability of getting tails in a single flip is also 1/2.\n\nThe probability of getting heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips is given by the binomial distribution:\n\n$$P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\nwhere:\n\nX is the number of successes (heads)\nk is the number of successes we want to get (8)\nn is the number of trials (10)\np is the probability of success (1/2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$P(X = 8) = \\binom{10}{8}(1/2)^8(1/2)^{10-8} = 0.0439$$\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting heads in exactly 8 of the 10 flips is 0.0439.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.0439$}.
