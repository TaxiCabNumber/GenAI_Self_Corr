At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen throws four identical darts. Each hits one of four identical dartboards on the wall. After throwing the four darts, he lists the number of darts that hit each board, from greatest to least.  How many different lists are possible?",
        "inference": "There are four darts and four boards.\nThe board with the most hits can have 1, 2, 3, or 4 hits.\nIf the board with the most hits has 1 hit, then the boards with the second, third, and fourth most hits can each have 0 hits.\nIf the board with the most hits has 2 hits, then the boards with the second, third, and fourth most hits can have 0 or 1 hit.\nIf the board with the most hits has 3 hits, then the boards with the second, third, and fourth most hits can have 0 or 1 hit.\nIf the board with the most hits has 4 hits, then the boards with the second, third, and fourth most hits can have 0 hits.\nSo, there are $1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8$ different lists possible.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The ways to arrange identical darts on identical dartboards only depends on the number of darts on each board.  The ways to do this are $(4,0,0,0)$, $(3,1,0,0)$, $(2,2,0,0)$, $(2,1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways."
