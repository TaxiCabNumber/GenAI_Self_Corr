        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCrestwood Elementary School has an active four-square league, consisting of ten players, including Justin and Tim. Each day at recess, the ten players split into two four-square games, each with five players in no relevant order. Over the course of a semester, each possible match-up of five players occurs once. How many times did Justin play in the same game as Tim?",
        "inference": "There are $\\binom{10}{5}=252$ possible teams of 5 players. Justin and Tim are part of $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ teams of 5 players that do not include either of them. So, they must play in the same game $252-56 = \\boxed{196}$ times.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{196}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each game has 5 players. The games that we are counting include Justin, Tim, and 3 of the 8 other players. There are $\\binom{8}{3}$ = 56 such match-ups.\n\n\nAlternatively, There are $\\binom{10}{5}$ = 252 different possible match-ups involving 5 of the 10 players. By symmetry, every player plays in exactly half of them, 126 games. In each of the 126 games that Tim plays, he plays with 4 of the other 9 players. Again by symmetry, he plays with each of those 9 players in 4/9 of his games. So he plays against Justin in 4/9 of 126 games, or $\\boxed{56}$ games."
