At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA yogurt shop sells four flavors of yogurt and has six different toppings. How many combinations of one flavor and two different toppings are available?",
        "inference": "First, you need to find the number of ways to choose one flavor out of four. This can be done using combinations, denoted by $_nC_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 4 and r = 1, so the number of ways to choose one flavor is $_4C_1 = \\frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = 4$.\n\nNext, you need to find the number of ways to choose two toppings out of six. Again, you can use combinations, but this time n = 6 and r = 2: $_6C_2 = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15$.\n\nFinally, you need to multiply the number of ways to choose one flavor by the number of ways to choose two toppings to get the total number of combinations: $4 \\times 15 = 60$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 choices of flavor, and $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose two of the six toppings. The total number of combinations is $4\\cdot 15=\\boxed{60}$."
