At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a sequence of coin tosses, one can keep a record of instances in which a tail is immediately followed by a head, a head is immediately followed by a head, and etc. We denote these by TH, HH, and etc. For example, in the sequence TTTHHTHTTTHHTTH of 15 coin tosses we observe that there are two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences. How many different sequences of 15 coin tosses will contain exactly two HH, three HT, four TH, and five TT subsequences?\n",
        "inference": "It's simple counting problem with binomial coefficients. There are 15 coins in the sequence, so there are 15 choices to place the first H, then 14 choices to place the next H, and so on. So for the HH subsequences, there are ${15 \\choose 2} = \\frac{15\\cdot 14}{2\\cdot 1} = 105$ possible placements. Similarly, there are ${15 \\choose 3} = 455$ possible placements for the HT subsequences, ${15 \\choose 4} = 1365$ possible placements for the TH subsequences, and ${15 \\choose 5} = 3003$ possible placements for the TT subsequences. Multiplying these together, we get:\n$$105 \\times 455 \\times 1365 \\times 3003 = 2.347 \\times 10^{12}$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2.347 \\times 10^{12}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's consider each of the sequences of two coin tosses as an operation instead; this operation takes a string and adds the next coin toss on (eg, THHTH + HT = THHTHT). We examine what happens to the last coin toss. Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now. However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin. H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.\nNow we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in. There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts. There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument. We want to add 5 balls into 4 urns, which is the same as 3 dividers; hence this gives ${{5+3}\\choose3} = 56$ combinations. We do the same with 2 Hs to get ${{2+3}\\choose3} = 10$ combinations; thus there are $56 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{560}$ possible sequences."
