At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50\\}$ contains the first $50$ positive integers.  After the multiples of 2 and the multiples of 3 are removed, how many integers remain in the set $S$?",

There are $17$ multiples of $3$.\nHowever, $6$ is a multiple of both $2$ and $3$. So, we have counted it twice.\nTherefore, the number of integers that remain in the set $S$ is $50 - 25 - 17 + 6 = \\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",

At this point, there are $50-25=25$ integers in $S$. We still need to remove the multiples of 3 from $S$.\n\nSince $S$ only contains odd integers after the multiples of 2 are removed,  we must remove the odd multiples of 3 between 1 and 49.  These are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, of which there are 8.  Therefore, the number of integers remaining in the set $S$ is $25 - 8 = \\boxed{17}$."
