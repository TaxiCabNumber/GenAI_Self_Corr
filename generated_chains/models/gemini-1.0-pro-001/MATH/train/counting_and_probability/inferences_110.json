        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways to choose at least one apple.\n\nThere are two options: choose one apple or choose more than one apple.\n\n* Choose one apple: 1 way\n* Choose more than one apple: 4 ways (2, 3, 4, or 5 apples)\n\nTotal ways to choose at least one apple: 1 + 4 = 5\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of ways to choose oranges.\n\nThere are 11 options: choose 0 oranges, 1 orange, ..., or 10 oranges.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of ways to choose apples by the number of ways to choose oranges to get the total number of fruit baskets.\n\nTotal number of fruit baskets: 5 \u00d7 11 = 55\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{55}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets."
