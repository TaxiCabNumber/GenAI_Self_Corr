At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if each member sits next to two members of the other party? (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "The 5 Democrats can be seated in a circle in 4! ways.  For each of these arrangements, the 5 Republicans can be seated in 5! ways.  However, we have overcounted because each arrangement has been counted 5 times, once for each Democrat.  Therefore, the total number of ways is $\\frac{4!5!}{5}=\\boxed{2880}.$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2880}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only way that the Senators can be seated is if the seats alternate by party.  Fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat, so that we have removed the overcounting of rotations of the same arrangement.  Now there are $4!$ ways to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in the Republican seats, for a total of $5! \\times 4! = \\boxed{2,\\!880}$ arrangements."
