At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table. Three of them are chosen - all choices being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon. Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other. If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\n",
        "inference": "Firstly, Let us determine the number of ways of choosing the three knights to be sent off. Since all the 25 knights are eligible, there are 25 ways of selecting the first knight, 24 ways of selecting the second, and 23 of selecting the third. So the number of ways of selecting three knights out of 25 is\n$$25 \\times 24 \\times 23 = 13800$$\n\nNext, let us determine the number of ways in which at least two of the three knights are sitting next to each other. We may consider each of the three knights in turn and see how many ways each one has of sitting next to at least one of the others.\n\n1- The first knight has 2 neighbors. If at least two of the knights are sitting next to each other, then the first knight must sit next to one of these neighbors. There are therefore 2 ways in which the first knight can sit next to at least one of the other two knights.\n\n2- Once the first knight has been positioned, we have to consider how many ways the second knight can sit. It is not possible for the second knight to sit next to both of the other two knights. There are therefore 2 ways in which the second knight can sit next to at least one of the other two knights.\n\n3- Once the first two knights have been positioned, the third knight will have to sit next to one of them. There is therefore 1 way in which the third knight can sit next to at least one of the other two knights.\n\nThe total number of ways in which at least two of the three knights are sitting next to each other is therefore \n$$2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4$$\n\nSo the probability $P$ is given by\n$$P = \\frac{4}{13800} = \\frac{1}{3450} = \\frac{2}{6900}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can use complementary counting, by finding the probability that none of the three knights are sitting next to each other and subtracting it from $1$.\nImagine that the $22$ other (indistinguishable) people are already seated, and fixed into place.\nWe will place $A$, $B$, and $C$ with and without the restriction.\nThere are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $21$ places to put $B$, and $20$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot21\\cdot20$ ways to place $A, B, C$ in between these people with restrictions.\nWithout restrictions, there are $22$ places to put $A$, followed by $23$ places to put $B$, and $24$ places to put $C$ after $A$ and $B$. Hence, there are $22\\cdot23\\cdot24$ ways to place $A,B,C$ in between these people without restrictions.\nThus, the desired probability is $1-\\frac{22\\cdot21\\cdot20}{22\\cdot23\\cdot24}=1-\\frac{420}{552}=1-\\frac{35}{46}=\\frac{11}{46}$, and the answer is $11+46=\\boxed{57}$."
