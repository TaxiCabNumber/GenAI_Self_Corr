        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA mathematical organization is producing a set of commemorative license plates. Each plate contains a sequence of five characters chosen from the four letters in AIME and the four digits in 2007. No character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in 2007. A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains $N$ license plates. Find $\\frac{N}{10}$.",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose 5 characters from 8 is $\\binom{8}{5}=56$.  Each plate can be arranged in 5! ways.  Therefore, the total number of plates is $56\\cdot5!=1680$.  Thus, $\\frac{N}{10}=\\frac{1680}{10}=\\boxed{168}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{168}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a sequence contains no more than one 0, there are $7\\cdot 6\\cdot\n5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 2520$ sequences formed from the characters A, I, M, E, 2, 0, and 7. If a sequence contains two 0's, the 0's can be placed in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways, the remaining characters can be chosen in $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways, and those remaining characters can be arranged in $3! = 6$ ways, for a total of $10\\cdot 20\\cdot 6\n= 1200$ sequences. Thus $N = 2520 + 1200 = 3720$, and $\\frac{N}{10}=\n\\boxed{372}$."
