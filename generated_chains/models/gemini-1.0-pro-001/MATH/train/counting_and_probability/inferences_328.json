At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S$ be the set of positive integer divisors of $20^9.$ Three numbers are chosen independently and at random with replacement from the set $S$ and labeled $a_1,a_2,$ and $a_3$ in the order they are chosen. The probability that both $a_1$ divides $a_2$ and $a_2$ divides $a_3$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m.$\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe probability that $a_1$ divides $a_2$ is $\\frac{1}{9}$, since $a_1$ can be any of the $9$ divisors of $20^9$ and $a_2$ must be a multiple of $a_1$. By the same reasoning, the probability that $a_2$ divides $a_3$ is also $\\frac{1}{9}$. The probability that both events occur is the product of their probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{81}$.

We will consider each case separately. Note that the total amount of possibilities is $190^3$, as there are $(18+1)(9+1)=190$ choices for each factor.\nWe notice that if we add $1$ to $b_2$ and $2$ to $b_3$, then we can reach the stronger inequality $0\\le b_1<b_2+1<b_3+2\\le 20$. Therefore, if we pick $3$ integers from $0$ to $20$, they will correspond to a unique solution, forming a 1-1 correspondence between the numbers $b_1$, $b_2+1$, and $b_3+2$. This is also equivalent to applying stars and bars on distributing the powers of 2 and 5 through differences. The amount of solutions to this inequality is $\\dbinom{21}{3}$.\nThe case for $c_1$,$c_2$, and $c_3$ proceeds similarly for a result of $\\dbinom{12}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing three such factors is\\[\\frac{\\dbinom{21}{3} \\cdot \\dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\\]Simplification gives $\\frac{77}{1805}$, and therefore the answer is $\\boxed{77}$."
