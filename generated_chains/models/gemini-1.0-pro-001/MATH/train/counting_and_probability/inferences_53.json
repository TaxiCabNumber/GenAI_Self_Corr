At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many perfect squares are between 50 and 250?",
        "inference": "The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 50 is 64, and the largest perfect square less than or equal to 250 is 256. The number of perfect squares between 50 and 250 is equal to the number of perfect squares between 64 and 256. The perfect squares between 64 and 256 are 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225. So, the number of perfect squares between 50 and 250 is 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $7^2 < 50 < 8^2$ and $15^2 < 250 < 16^2$, the squares between 50 and 250 are $8^2,9^2,10^2,\\ldots,15^2$.  So there are $15 - 8 + 1 = \\boxed{8}$ such squares."
