At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA play has two different male roles, two different female roles and two different roles that can be either gender. Only a man can be assigned to a male role, and only a woman can be assigned to a female role. If five men and six women audition, in how many ways can the six roles be assigned?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Determine the number of ways to assign the male roles.**\n\nThere are two male roles, and five men to fill them. The number of ways to assign the male roles is: \n$$P(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{3!} = 20.$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of ways to assign the female roles.**\n\nThere are two female roles, and six women to fill them. The number of ways to assign the female roles is: \n$$P(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{4!} = 30.$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of ways to assign the gender-neutral roles.**\n\nThere are two gender-neutral roles, and six actors (three men and three women) to fill them. The number of ways to assign the gender-neutral roles is: \n$$P(6, 2) = \\frac{6!}{4!} = 30.$$\n\n**Step 4: Multiply the number of ways to assign each type of role to get the total number of ways to assign all roles.**\n\nThe total number of ways to assign all roles is: 20 * 30 * 30 = 18000.\n\n**Final Answer: \"\\\\boxed{$18000$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We start with the most restrictive conditions: the roles that are not open to both men and women.  First, we will fill the two male roles. There are 5 men, so there are $5 \\cdot 4= 20$ ways to assign 2 of the 5 men to the distinct male roles. Doing the same for the female roles, there are $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$ ways. Finally, of the $5+6 - 2 - 2 = 7$ remaining actors, there are $7 \\cdot 6 = 42$ ways to assign the leftovers to the either-gender roles. Multiplying, there are $20 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 42 = \\boxed{25200}$ ways of assigning the six roles."
