At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the probability that when we roll four fair 6-sided dice, they won't all show the same number?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the probability of all four dice showing the same number.\nThere are 6 possible outcomes for each die, so there are 6^4 = 1296 possible outcomes for four dice. Only 6 of these outcomes have all four dice showing the same number. Therefore, the probability of all four dice showing the same number is 6/1296 = 1/216.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the probability of not all four dice showing the same number.\nThe probability of not all four dice showing the same number is 1 minus the probability of all four dice showing the same number. Therefore, the probability of not all four dice showing the same number is 1 - 1/216 = 215/216.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{215}{216}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Counting the number of outcomes in which four 6-sided dice don't all show the same number would require some pretty delicate casework.  However, counting all the outcomes in which four 6-sided dice do all show the same number is very easy: there are only 6 ways this can happen, namely all ones, all twos, all threes, all fours, all fives, and all sixes.  So since there are $6^4$ total outcomes, we can conclude that $$ P(\\text{4 dice all show the same number}) = \\frac{6}{6^4} = \\frac{1}{6^3} = \\frac{1}{216}. $$Therefore, using the principle of complementary probabilities, we can conclude that $$ P(\\text{4 dice don't all show the same number}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{215}{216}}. $$"
