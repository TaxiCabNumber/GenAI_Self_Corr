At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pizza parlor offers six toppings. What is the greatest number of four-topping pizzas that can be made such that no two pizzas have the same topping combination?",
        "inference": "There are 6 choices for the first topping, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, and 3 for the fourth. So, the number of four-topping pizzas that can be made is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{360.}",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 6 choices of toppings, and each pizza must have 4 of them, there are ${6 \\choose 4} = \\boxed{15}$ four-topping pizzas."
