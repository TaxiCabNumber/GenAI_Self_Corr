At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 12 different-colored crayons in a box. How many ways can Karl select four crayons if the order in which he draws them out does not matter?",
        "inference": "The number of ways Karl can select four crayons from 12 different-colored crayons without regarding order is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, r) = n! / (n - r)! / r!\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 12 and r = 4:\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (12 - 4)! / 4!\n= 12! / 8! / 4!\n= (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n= 495\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$495$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 ways to select the first crayon, 11 ways to select the second, 10 ways to select the third, and 9 ways to select the last. However, since order does not matter, we must divide by the number of ways he can draw out the crayons, which is $4!$.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{12\\times11\\times10\\times9}{4!}=\\boxed{495}$ ways."
