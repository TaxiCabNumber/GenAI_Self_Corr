        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers $1447$, $1005$ and $1231$ have something in common: each is a $4$-digit number beginning with $1$ that has exactly two identical digits. How many such numbers are there?\n",
        "inference": "The first digit is $1$. The remaining three digits are chosen from the set $\\{0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. Since two of the remaining three digits must be identical, there are $9$ choices for the identical digits, and $8$ choices for the remaining digit. Therefore, the number of such numbers is $9\\cdot8=\\boxed{72}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{72}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the two identical digits are both $1$. Since the thousands digit must be $1$, only one of the other three digits can be $1$. This means the possible forms for the number are\n$11xy,\\qquad 1x1y,\\qquad1xy1$\nBecause the number must have exactly two identical digits, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq1$, and $y\\neq1$. Hence, there are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nNow suppose that the two identical digits are not $1$. Reasoning similarly to before, we have the following possibilities:\n$1xxy,\\qquad1xyx,\\qquad1yxx.$\nAgain, $x\\neq y$, $x\\neq 1$, and $y\\neq 1$. There are $3\\cdot9\\cdot8=216$ numbers of this form.\nThus the answer is $216+216=\\boxed{432}$."
