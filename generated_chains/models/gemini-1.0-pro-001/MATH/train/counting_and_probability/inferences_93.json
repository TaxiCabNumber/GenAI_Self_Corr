Since we are looking for a $1$ rolled three times and a number not $1$ rolled once, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$. Now, we have to consider the order of the rolls. The number that is not a $1$ could be rolled on the first, second, third, or fourth roll, so we multiply by four.
