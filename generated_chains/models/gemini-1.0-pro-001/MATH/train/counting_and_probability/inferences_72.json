        "inference": "There are 26 possible letters for each of the two letters on the license plate, so there are $26^2$ possible combinations of letters.\n\nThere are 10 possible digits for each of the two digits on the license plate, but one must be odd and the other must be even. There are 5 odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 5 even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), so there are $5 \\times 5 = 25$ possible combinations of digits that satisfy the odd/even requirement.\n\nTherefore, there are $26^2 \\times 25 = 16900$ possible license plates that consist of 2 letters followed by 2 digits, if one of the digits must be odd and the other must be even.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16900}$.
