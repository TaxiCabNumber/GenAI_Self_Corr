        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 3 math clubs in the school district, with 5, 7, and 8 students respectively. Each club has two co-presidents. If I randomly select a club, and then randomly select three members of that club to give a copy of $\\emph{Introduction to} \\allowbreak\\ \\emph{Counting and} \\allowbreak\\ \\emph{Probability}$, what is the probability that two of the people who receive books are co-presidents?",
        "inference": "The probability of selecting a club is $1/3$. The probability of selecting three members from a club is $3/5$, $3/7$, or $3/8$, depending on the club. The probability of selecting two co-presidents is $2/5$, $2/7$, or $2/8$, depending on the club. To find the probability of selecting two co-presidents from a club, multiply the probability of selecting a club by the probability of selecting three members from that club by the probability of selecting two co-presidents from that club. Then add the three probabilities together to get the total probability.\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{6}{49} + \\frac{3}{40}=\\frac{56}{240}+\\frac{30}{240}+\\frac{18}{240}=\\frac{104}{240}=\\frac{13}{30}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{30}}$.
