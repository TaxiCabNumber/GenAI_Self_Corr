At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive standard six-sided dice are rolled.  We are told there is no three-of-a-kind, but there is a pair of dice that show the same number.  These two dice are set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled.  What is the probability that after re-rolling these three dice, at least three of the five dice show the same value?",
        "inference": "There are 6 possible outcomes for each die, and 6^5 = 7776 possible outcomes for the initial roll of the five dice.  There are 5 * 6 = 30 possible pairs of dice that could show the same number, and each of these pairs could be set aside in 3 ways.  So there are 30 * 3 = 90 ways to set aside a pair of dice.  The probability of setting aside a pair of dice is 90/7776.\n\nAfter setting aside a pair of dice, there are 4 * 6 = 24 possible outcomes for the remaining three dice.  There are 4 possible outcomes for each of the three dice that would result in at least three dice showing the same value.  So there are 4^3 = 64 such outcomes.  The probability of rolling at least three of the same value on the remaining three dice is 64/24^3 = 1/216.\n\nThe probability of setting aside a pair of dice and then rolling at least three of the same value on the remaining three dice is (90/7776) * (1/216) = 1/16128.  \n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16128}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If at least one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside, we will have at least three dice showing the same value. But we will also have three dice showing the same value if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are five ways for each of the three dice NOT to match the pair, so there are $5^3=125$ ways for NONE of the three dice to match the pair, so there are $216-125=91$ ways for at least one of the three dice to match the pair.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $6$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have.\n\nBut we have overcounted by $1;$ both of the above cases include the outcome where all five dice match. So there are $91+6-1 = 96$ ways to have at least three dice match. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{96}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}.$$"
