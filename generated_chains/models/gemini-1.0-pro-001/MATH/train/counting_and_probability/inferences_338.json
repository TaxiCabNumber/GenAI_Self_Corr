        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA given sequence $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$ of distinct real numbers can be put in ascending order by means of one or more \"bubble passes\". A bubble pass through a given sequence consists of comparing the second term with the first term, and exchanging them if and only if the second term is smaller, then comparing the third term with the second term and exchanging them if and only if the third term is smaller, and so on in order, through comparing the last term, $r_n$, with its current predecessor and exchanging them if and only if the last term is smaller.\nThe example below shows how the sequence 1, 9, 8, 7 is transformed into the sequence 1, 8, 7, 9 by one bubble pass. The numbers compared at each step are underlined.\n$\\underline{1 \\quad 9} \\quad 8 \\quad 7$\n$1 \\quad {}\\underline{9 \\quad 8} \\quad 7$\n$1 \\quad 8 \\quad \\underline{9 \\quad 7}$\n$1 \\quad 8 \\quad 7 \\quad 9$\nSuppose that $n = 40$, and that the terms of the initial sequence $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_{40}$ are distinct from one another and are in random order. Let $p/q$, in lowest terms, be the probability that the number that begins as $r_{20}$ will end up, after one bubble pass, in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place. Find $p + q$.\n",
        "inference": "There are $40!$ ways to order $40$ distinct objects, and each of these orderings is equally likely when $40$ objects are randomly ordered.  \n1.  In the original ordering of the $40$ objects, the object that will end up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place can be any one of the $40$ objects, and this can happen in $40$ ways.\n2.  Once the object that will end up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place has been selected, the remaining $39$ objects can be ordered in $39!$ ways.\n3.  In the original ordering, $r_{20}$ can be any one of the $39$ objects other than the one that will end up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place, and this can happen in $39$ ways.\n4.  Once $r_{20}$ has been selected, the remaining $38$ objects can be ordered in $38!$ ways.\n5.  Of the $38!$ orderings of the remaining $38$ objects, $37!$ of them preserve the ordering of all of the objects except $r_{20}$, so that $r_{20}$ ends up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place.\n6.  There is only one ordering of the remaining $38$ objects that places $r_{20}$ in the $20^{\\mbox{th}}$ place, and this is the ordering that results in the original sequence.\nTherefore, the number of orderings for which $r_{20}$ ends up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place is $40 \\cdot 39! \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38! \\cdot 37! = 40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 37! = 40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38!$, and the number of orderings for which $r_{20}$ does not end up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place is $40! - 40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38! = 40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38! \\cdot (1 - 39)$. \nTherefore, the probability that $r_{20}$ ends up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place is \n$$\\frac{40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38!}{40!}=\\frac{39}{40},$$\n\nand the probability that $r_{20}$ does not end up in the $30^{\\mbox{th}}$ place is \n$$\\frac{40 \\cdot 39 \\cdot 38! \\cdot (1 - 39)}{40!}=\\frac{1}{40}.$$\n\nTherefore, $$p + q = \\frac{39}{40} + \\frac{1}{40}=\\boxed{1}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If any of $r_1, \\ldots, r_{19}$ is larger than $r_{20}$, one of these numbers will be compared with $r_{20}$ on the 19th step of the first bubble pass and $r_{20}$ will be moved back to the 19th position. Thus, $r_{20}$ must be the largest of the first 20 terms. In addition, $r_{20}$ must be larger than $r_{21}, r_{22}, \\ldots, r_{30}$ but smaller than $r_{31}$ in order that it move right to the 30th position but then not continue moving right to the 31st.\nThus, our problem can be restated: What is the probability that in a sequence of 31 distinct real numbers, the largest is in position 31 and the second-largest is in position 20 (the other 29 numbers are irrelevant)?\nThis is much easier to solve: there are $31!$ ways to order the first thirty-one numbers and $29!$ ways to arrange them so that the largest number is in the 31st position and the second-largest is in the 20th.
