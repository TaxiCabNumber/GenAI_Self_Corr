At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Boston weatherman says there is a 75 percent chance of rain for each day of the Labor Day four-day weekend. If it doesn't rain, then the weather will be sunny.  Paul and Yuri want it to be sunny one of those days for a World War III preenactment, but if it's sunny for more than one day they won't know what to do with themselves. What is the probability they get the weather they want? Give your answer as a fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of it not raining on any given day is 25%.  We want to find the probability that it doesn't rain on exactly one of the 4 days of the weekend.  There are 4 ways to choose the day that it is sunny.  The probability of it not raining on exactly one of the 4 days is:\n\n$$4 \\times 0.25^1 \\times 0.75^3 = 0.3164$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.3164}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose which three of the four days it will be rainy so that the other day it will be sunny. For any of those 4 choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) ^1 = \\frac{27}{256}$ chance for that choice to happen, because there is a $\\frac{3}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be rainy, and a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be sunny. The total probability is then $4 \\cdot \\frac{27}{256}= \\boxed{\\frac{27}{64}}$."
