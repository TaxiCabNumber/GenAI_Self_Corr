At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have 3 boys and 3 girls?",

So, the total number of ways to select a team with 3 boys and 3 girls is:\n\n\\binom{6}{3} \\cdot \\binom{8}{3} = 20 \\cdot 56 = 1120.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1120$}. I hope it is correct.",
