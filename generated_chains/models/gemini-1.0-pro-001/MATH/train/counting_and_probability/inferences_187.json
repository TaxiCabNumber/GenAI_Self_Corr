At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
        "inference": "1. First, find the number of 4-letter words without any vowels. This is simply 3^4 = 81.\n\n2. Next, find the number of 4-letter words with exactly one vowel. Number of ways to choose one vowel out of 2: 2C1 = 2 ways. Number of ways to choose 3 consonants out of 3: 3C3 = 1 way. Number of 4-letter words with exactly one vowel: 2 * 1 * 3^3 = 54.\n\n3. Next, find the number of 4-letter words with exactly two vowels. Number of ways to choose two vowels out of 2: 2C2 = 1 way. Number of ways to choose 2 consonants out of 3: 3C2 = 3 ways. Number of 4-letter words with exactly two vowels: 1 * 3 * 3^2 = 27.\n\n4. Finally, find the number of 4-letter words with exactly three vowels. Number of ways to choose three vowels out of 2: 2C3 = 1 way. Number of ways to choose 1 consonant out of 3: 3C1 = 3 ways. Number of 4-letter words with exactly three vowels: 1 * 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n5. Add the number of 4-letter words with no vowels, exactly one vowel, exactly two vowels, and exactly three vowels together to get the final answer: 81 + 54 + 27 + 9 = 171.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{171}.

        "ground_truth": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$."
