Since $0 \\le x \\le 3$ and $0 \\le y \\le 6$, there are $4$ possible values for $x$ and $7$ possible values for $y$, so there are $4 \\times 7 = 28$ possible points in total.\n\nNext, we can find the number of points such that $x+y \\le 4$. There are $1$ possible value for $x$ and $3$ possible values for $y$ such that $x+y = 4$, and there are $3$ possible values for $x$ and $1$ possible value for $y$ such that $x+y = 4$, so there are $1 \\times 3 + 3 \\times 1 = 6$ points such that $x+y \\le 4$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $x+y \\le 4$ is $\\frac{6}{28} = \\frac{3}{14}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{14}}$.
