At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of three-digit whole numbers without any 7 or 9.\n\nThere are 10 choices for the first digit (0 is not allowed), 9 choices for the second digit (since it cannot be 7 or 9), and 8 choices for the third digit (since it cannot be 7 or 9). Therefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers without any 7 or 9 is:\n\n```\n10 x 9 x 8 = 720\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or 9.\n\nThis is the total number of three-digit whole numbers minus the number of three-digit whole numbers without any 7 or 9. Therefore, the number of three-digit whole numbers with at least one 7 or 9 is:\n\n```\n1000 - 720 = 280\n```\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{280}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$."
