I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $4!$. Then since the T's and the O's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of T's and the arrangement of O's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{6}$."
