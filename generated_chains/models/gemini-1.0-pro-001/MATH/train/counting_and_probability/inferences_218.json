At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and 8 are randomly arranged into a six-digit positive integer, what is the probability that the integer is divisible by 15? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "First, the integer must be divisible by 5. So, the last digit must be either 5 or 0. There are 6 choices for the first digit, 5 choices for the second digit, 4 choices for the third digit, 3 choices for the fourth digit, and 2 choices for the fifth digit. So, there are $6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 720$ different six-digit positive integers that can be formed.\n\nNow, the integer must be divisible by 15. So, the last digit must be 0 and the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. The only six-digit positive integer that can be formed that has a last digit of 0 and a sum of the digits divisible by 3 is 321550.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the integer is divisible by 15 is $\\frac{1}{720}$.\n\nFinal Answer:  $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{720}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3. To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
