        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider a regular octagon.  How many triangles can be formed whose vertices are the vertices of the octagon?",
        "inference": "Since the octagon is a regular polygon, we can form triangles by selecting any three vertices of the octagon. \nThe number of ways to select 3 vertices from a set of 8 vertices is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8\\times7\\times6}{3\\times2\\times1} = 56$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{56}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$."
