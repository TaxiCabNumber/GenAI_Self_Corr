At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA library has six identical copies of a certain book. At any given time, some of these copies are at the library and some are checked out. How many different ways are there for some of the books to be in the library and the rest to be checked out if at least one book is in the library and at least one is checked out?  (The books should be considered indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "There are 6 books in total, and we want to select at least 1 book to be in the library and at least 1 book to be checked out. We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. Let's assume that the books in the library are represented by stars (*) and the books checked out are represented by bars (|). Since there are six books, we have 7 slots (6 for stars and 1 for the separator). We can select 5 slots for the stars and 1 slot for the separator to ensure that at least one book is in the library and at least one book is checked out. The number of different ways to arrange 5 stars and 1 separator in 7 slots is given by:\n\n$$\\binom{7}{5} = \\frac{7!}{5!2!} = 21$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$21$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From 1 to 5 books can be in the library, and the rest are checked out. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ possibilities."
