At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",

Similarly, we can choose any one of the three boxes for the third ball, for the fourth ball, and for the fifth ball. Therefore, there are $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$ ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{243}$. I hope it is correct.",
