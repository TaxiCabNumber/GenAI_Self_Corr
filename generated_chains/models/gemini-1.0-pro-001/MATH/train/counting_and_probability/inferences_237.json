At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarius is entering a wildlife photo contest, and wishes to arrange his seven snow leopards of different heights in a row. If the shortest two leopards have inferiority complexes and demand to be placed at the ends of the row, how many ways can he line up the leopards?",
        "inference": "The shortest leopards must be at the ends of the row, so there are 7 possibilities for the shortest leopard on the left end and 6 possibilities for the shortest leopard on the right end. There are then 5 remaining leopards to fill the 5 remaining positions in the row, which can be done in 5!. Therefore, the total number of ways to line up the leopards is:\n\n7 * 6 * 5! = 7 * 6 * 120 = 5040\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5040}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are two ways to arrange the shortest two leopards. For the five remaining leopards, there are $5!$ ways to arrange them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $2\\times5!=\\boxed{240\\text{ ways.}}$"
