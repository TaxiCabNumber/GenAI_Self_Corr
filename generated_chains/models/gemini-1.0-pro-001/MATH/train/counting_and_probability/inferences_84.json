At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The number of 1's obtained can be 0, 1, or 2.\nThe probability of getting a 1 on one die is 1/6.\nThe probability of getting a 1 on two dice is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.\nThe probability of getting 0 1's is (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.\nThe probability of getting 2 1's is 1/36.\nThe expected number of 1's is (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 1/36) + (2 * 1/36) = 1/18 + 2/36 = 1/9.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1/9}.

        "ground_truth": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
