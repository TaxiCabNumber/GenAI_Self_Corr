At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many of the natural numbers from 1 to 600, inclusive, contain the digit 5 at least once? (The numbers 152 and 553 are two natural numbers that contain the digit 5 at least once, but 430 is not.)",
        "inference": " Solution:\n\nThe natural numbers from 1 to 600 that contain the digit 5 at least once are those that are multiples of 5 or contain the digit 5 in their representation.\nThe number of multiples of 5 from 1 to 600 is $\\lfloor\\frac{600}{5}\\rfloor = 120$.\nNow, we need to count the number of natural numbers from 1 to 600 that contain the digit 5 in their representation but are not multiples of 5.\nWe can break this down into cases based on the position of the digit 5 in the representation.\n\nCase 1: The digit 5 is in the units place. There are 60 such numbers, since the tens and hundreds digits can be any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nCase 2: The digit 5 is in the tens place. There are 60 such numbers, since the units and hundreds digits can be any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nCase 3: The digit 5 is in the hundreds place. There are 12 such numbers, since the tens and units digits can be any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but the number cannot be a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of natural numbers from 1 to 600 that contain the digit 5 at least once is $120 + 60 + 60 + 12 = 252$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{252}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The \"at least\" is a clue to try complementary counting -- we count number of numbers with no 5's at all, and subtract this from 600, since there are 600 numbers from 1 to 600.\n\nTo make a number with no 5's at all that is less than 600, we have 5 choices for the first number: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  (We have to remember to include 600 at the end.)  We can use any digit besides 5 for the tens and for the units digit, so we have 9 choices for each of these digits.  This gives us a total of $5\\cdot 9\\cdot 9 = 405$ numbers less than 600 with no 5's.  However, this count includes 000, and doesn't include 600.  (Always be careful about extremes!)  Including 600 and excluding 000, we still have 405 numbers less than 600 with no 5's, so we have $600-405 = \\boxed{195}$ numbers with at least one 5."
