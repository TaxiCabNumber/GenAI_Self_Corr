At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different four-letter arrangements can be formed using the six letters $A, B, C, D, E$ and $F$, if the first letter must be $C$, one of the other letters must be $B$, and no letter can be used more than once in the arrangement?",
        "inference": "There are four letters that can be used in the first three places after $C$: $A, B, D, E, F$.\n\nThere are three letters that can be used in the fourth place: $A, D, E, F$.\n\nSo, the number of different four-letter arrangements is $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There is 1 way to make the first letter C and 3 ways to make one of the other letters B. We now have 4 ways to pick the letter for the first remaining spot and 3 ways to pick the letter for the last remaining spot. This is a total of $1\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot3=\\boxed{36}$ ways to arrange the letters."
