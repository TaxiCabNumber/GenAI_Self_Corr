At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix cards numbered $1$ through $6$ are to be lined up in a row. Find the number of arrangements of these six cards where one of the cards can be removed leaving the remaining five cards in either ascending or descending order.\n",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Count the number of arrangements of six cards in any order.**\n\nThere are $6!$ (6 factorial) ways to arrange six cards in any order.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the number of arrangements where the removed card leaves the remaining five cards in neither ascending nor descending order.**\n\nThere are 20 ways to arrange five cards in neither ascending nor descending order. For example, 21345 and 54321 are neither ascending nor descending.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the result by 6.**\n\nSince any of the six cards can be removed, we need to multiply the result in Step 2 by 6.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{1440}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Realize that any sequence that works (ascending) can be reversed for descending, so we can just take the amount of sequences that satisfy the ascending condition and multiply by two.\nIf we choose any of the numbers $1$ through $6$, there are five other spots to put them, so we get $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$. However, we overcount some cases. Take the example of $132456$. We overcount this case because we can remove the $3$ or the $2$. Therefore, any cases with two adjacent numbers swapped is overcounted, so we subtract $5$ cases (namely, $213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, 123465$,) to get $30-5=25$, but we have to add back one more for the original case, $123456$. Therefore, there are $26$ cases. Multiplying by $2$ gives the desired answer, $\\boxed{52}$."
