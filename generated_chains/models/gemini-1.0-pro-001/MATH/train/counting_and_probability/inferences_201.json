At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many two-digit numbers are there in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit?",
        "inference": "Let x be the tens digit and y be the ones digit.  Since the tens digit is greater than the ones digit, we have x > y.  The number of two-digit numbers is 90, since the smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest two-digit number is 99.  The number of two-digit numbers in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit is the number of ways we can choose x and y, such that x > y.  There are 9 choices for x (since x can be any digit from 2 to 9) and for each choice of x, there are x - 1 choices for y (since y must be a digit less than x).  Therefore, the number of two-digit numbers in which the tens digit is greater than the ones digit is 9 * (9 - 1) = 9 * 8 = 72.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{72}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In addition to two-digit numbers, consider the one-digit numbers $01$ through $09.$ Of these $99$ numbers, $9$ have repeated digits $01,$ $02,$ $03,$ $\\ldots,$ $99,$ namely: $11,$ $22,$ $33,$ $\\ldots,$ and $99.$ Of the remaining $90$ numbers, each one has a unique counterpart formed by swapping their tens and units digit. Thus among these, $45$ have a tens digit greater than the units digit. (The other $45$ have a tens digit smaller than the units digit.) The required answer is $\\boxed{45}.$"
