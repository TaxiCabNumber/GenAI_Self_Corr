At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Morse code, each symbol is represented by a sequence of dashes and dots. How many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 2 choices for each dot or dash (either include it or not). Therefore, there are $2^1=2$ symbols that can be represented using 1 total dot or dash. There are $2^2=4$ symbols that can be represented using 2 total dots or dashes. There are $2^3=8$ symbols that can be represented using 3 total dots or dashes. There are $2^4=16$ symbols that can be represented using 4 total dots or dashes. Therefore, the total number of distinct symbols that can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes is $2+4+8+16=\\boxed{30}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We proceed by casework.\n\nCase I: 1 dot or dash\nThere are two possibilities: one dot, or one dash.\n\nCase II: 2 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ sequences in this case.\n\nCase III: 3 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$ sequences in this case.\n\nCase IV: 4 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16$ sequences in this case.\n\nThus, there are $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = \\boxed{30}$ distinct symbols that can be formed."
