At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRyan has 3 red lava lamps and 3 blue lava lamps. He arranges them in a row on a shelf randomly, and then randomly turns 3 of them on. What is the probability that the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are $3 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 72$ possible arrangements of the lamps.\n\nIn order for the leftmost lamp to be blue and off, there are $3$ choices for the lamp, and $2$ choices for the other two lamps to be either red or off. So there are $3 \\times 2^2 = 12$ arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off.\n\nIn order for the rightmost lamp to be red and on, there are $3$ choices for the lamp, and $2$ choices for the other two lamps to be either blue or off. So there are $3 \\times 2^2 = 12$ arrangements where the rightmost lamp is red and on.\n\nTherefore, there are $12 \\times 12 = 144$ arrangements where the leftmost lamp is blue and off, and the rightmost lamp is red and on.\n\nSo the probability is $\\frac{144}{72} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose where the red lamps go, and $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which lamps are on. If the left lamp is blue and off, and the right lamp is red and on, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are red, and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which of the remaining lamps are on. Therefore, the probability is $\\dfrac{6\\cdot6}{20\\cdot20}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{100}}$."
