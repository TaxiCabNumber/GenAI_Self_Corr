At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe call a number a mountain number if its middle digit is larger than any other digit.  For example, 284 is a mountain number.  How many 3-digit mountain numbers are there?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the number of possible middle digits. Since the middle digit must be larger than the other two digits, it can be any digit from 2 to 9.  So, there are 8 possible middle digits.\n\nNext, we need to find out the number of possible digits for the other two digits. Since the digits for the other two digits must be less than middle digit, it can be any digit from 0 to middle-1. So, there are middle-1 possible digits for the other two digits. \n\nFinally, we need to multiply the number of possible middle digits by the square of the number of possible digits for the other two digits to get the total number of 3-digit mountain numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 3-digit mountain numbers is:\n\n$$\\text{Number of possible middle digits} \\times (\\text{Number of possible digits for the other two digits})^2$$\n\n$$= 8 \\times (middle-1)^2$$\n\n$$= 8 \\times (8 -1)^2$$\n\n$$= 8 \\times 7^2$$\n\n$$= 8 \\times 49$$\n\n$$=  392$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$392$}.

        "ground_truth": "We will break this into three cases.\n\nCase 1: numbers of the form $xyx$ ($x \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding palindrome ($xyx$) mountain number, so the number of these is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$.\n\nCase 2: numbers of the form $xyz$ ($z \\ne 0, x \\ne z$).\n\nAny group of three nonzero digits ($y > x > z > 0$) has two corresponding mountain numbers ($xyz$ and $zyx$), so the number of these is $2 \\times \\binom{9}{3} = 168$.\n\nCase 3: numbers of the form $xy0$ ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$, so there are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ of these.\n\nSo the total number of mountain numbers is $36 + 168 + 36 = \\boxed{240}$."
