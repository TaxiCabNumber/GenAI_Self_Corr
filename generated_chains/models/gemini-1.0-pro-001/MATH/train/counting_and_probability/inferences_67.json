At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row of chairs if three of the people, John, Wilma, and Paul, refuse to sit in three consecutive seats?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince John, Wilma, and Paul cannot sit in three consecutive seats, there must be at least one other person between any two of them. This means that John, Wilma, and Paul split the row of chairs into three parts. The people who are not John, Wilma, or Paul can be arranged in any of the five spaces between John, Wilma, and Paul, and John, Wilma, and Paul can be arranged in any of the three parts. Therefore, the total number of ways that the 8 people can be seated is $5! \\cdot 3! \\cdot 3!$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{181440}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of all seating arrangements is $8!$. The number of seating arrangements in which John, Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 3!$. We can arrive at $6!\\times 3!$ by considering John, Wilma and Paul as one person, arranging the ``six'' people (the JWP super-person plus the 5 other people) first, then arranging John, Wilma and Paul.  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $$8!-6!\\times 3!=8\\times 7\\times 6! - 6!\\times 3! = (8\\times 7 - 3!)6! = (50)(720)=\\boxed{36000}.$$"
