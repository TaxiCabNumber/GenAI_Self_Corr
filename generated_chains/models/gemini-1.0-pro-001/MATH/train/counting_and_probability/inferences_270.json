At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct triangles can be constructed by connecting three different vertices of a cube? (Two triangles are distinct if they have different locations in space.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe cube has 8 vertices. So, the number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 8 is $C(8,3) = \\frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56$.\n\nHowever, some of these triangles are congruent, so we need to subtract the number of congruent triangles.\n\nTwo triangles are congruent if they have the same side lengths. There are 4 different side lengths in a cube. So, the number of ways to choose 3 side lengths out of 4 is $C(4,3) = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct triangles is $C(8,3) - C(4,3) = 56 - 4 = \\boxed{52}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are eight vertices of a cube, and we choose three of these to form a triangle. Thus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is $\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8\\cdot7\\cdot6}{3\\cdot2} = \\boxed{56}$."
