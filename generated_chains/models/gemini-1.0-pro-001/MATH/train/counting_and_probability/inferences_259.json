I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 4 red marbles, 5 white marbles, and 6 blue marbles.  Three marbles are drawn from the bag (without replacement).  What is the probability that they are all the same color?",
        "inference": "For the first marble drawn, there are 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 total marbles, so the probability of drawing a red marble is 4/15.\nOnce a red marble has been drawn, there are now 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 total marbles, and 3 red marbles, so the probability of drawing a second red marble is 3/14.\nOnce two red marbles have been drawn, there are now 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 total marbles, and 2 red marbles, so the probability of drawing a third red marble is 2/13.\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three red marbles is 4/15 * 3/14 * 2/13 = 8/273.\nSimilarly, the probability of drawing three white marbles is 5/15 * 4/14 * 3/13 = 20/273, and the probability of drawing three blue marbles is 6/15 * 5/14 * 4/13 = 12/273.\nTherefore, the probability of drawing three marbles all of the same color is 8/273 + 20/273 + 12/273 = 40/273.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{40}{273}}$.
