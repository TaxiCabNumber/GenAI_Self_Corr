At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a Jack, the second card is a Queen, and the third card is a King? Assuming the dealing is done without replacement.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The probability of drawing a Jack on the first draw is 4/52.\n**Step 2:** The probability of drawing a Queen on the second draw, given that a Jack was drawn on the first draw, is 4/51.\n**Step 3:** The probability of drawing a King on the third draw, given that a Jack was drawn on the first draw and a Queen was drawn on the second draw, is 4/50.\n**Step 4:** The probability of drawing a Jack, then a Queen, then a King is the product of these three probabilities: (4/52) x (4/51) x (4/50) = 64/66300.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$64/66300$}.
