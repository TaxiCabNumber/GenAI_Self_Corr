At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads?",
        "inference": "There are 2 outcomes for each coin: heads or tails.  So there are 2*2*2*2 = 16 total outcomes.  \n\nThe outcomes that are worth at least 15 cents are:\n\n* H H H T = 25 cents\n* H H T H = 25 cents\n* H T H H = 25 cents\n* T H H H = 25 cents\n* H H H H = 50 cents\n\nSo there are 5 outcomes out of 16 that are worth at least 15 cents.  The probability of getting at least 15 cents is 5/16.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5/16}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). If the quarter is heads, there are 8 possibilities, since each of the other three coins may come up heads or tails.  If the quarter is tails, then the nickel and dime must be heads, so there are 2 possibilities, since the penny can be heads or tails.  So there are $8+2 = 10$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{10}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}$."
