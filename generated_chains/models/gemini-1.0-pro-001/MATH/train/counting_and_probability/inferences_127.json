At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 6 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet? (Note that two arrangements are the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce the other.)",
        "inference": "The number of ways to arrange 6 distinct beads on a bracelet is equal to the number of permutations of 6 objects, which is given by:\n\n$$P(6) = 6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$$\n\nSince rotating or reflecting a bracelet produces the same arrangement, we need to divide this value by the number of ways to rotate or reflect a bracelet. A bracelet can be rotated in 6 different ways, and it can be reflected in 1 way (flipping it over). So the number of ways to rotate or reflect a bracelet is:\n\n$$6 \\times 1 = 6$$\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 distinct beads on a bracelet is:\n\n$$\\frac{720}{6} = 120$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$."
