At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cubes with the faces numbered 1 through 6 are tossed and the numbers shown on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 36 possible outcomes when two cubes are tossed. The sums that are even are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. There are 6 even sums out of 36 possible outcomes, so the probability of getting an even sum is 6 / 36 = 1 / 6.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/6}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After the first cube has been rolled, the other cube has six possible results. Three are one parity, and three are the other parity, so no matter what the first cube shows, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac12}$ chance that the sum is either parity. Note that this is true no matter how many such cubes are rolled."
