At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many combinations of pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents) and/or dimes (10 cents) are there with a total value of 25 cents?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of pennies, \\(y\\) be the number of nickels, and \\(z\\) be the number of dimes.  We need the solution to the equation \n\n$$1x+5y+10z=25$$\n\nWe combine like terms:\n\n$$x+5y+10z=25$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as\n\n$$x+5(y+2z)=25$$\n\nIn order to have a sum of 25, \\(y+2z\\) must be 5.\n\nThere are 6 different ways to get a sum of 5 using nickels and dimes:\n\n$$(y,z)=(0,5),(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1),(5,0)$$\n\nFor each of these solutions, we can compute the number of combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes.  For example, if \\(y=0\\) and \\(z=5\\), we have 5 dimes and 0 nickels.  This gives us a total of \n\n$$5(10)+0(5)=50$$\n\ncents.  Since this is more than 25 cents, this is not a valid solution.  \n\nWe can check the other 5 solutions:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}(y,z)&=(1,4) & 1\\cdot1+5\\cdot4+10\\cdot0&=25 \\\\\\ (y,z)&=(2,3) & 1\\cdot2+5\\cdot3+10\\cdot0&=25 \\\\\\ (y,z)&=(3,2) & 1\\cdot3+5\\cdot2+10\\cdot0&=25 \\\\\\ (y,z)&=(4,1) & 1\\cdot4+5\\cdot1+10\\cdot0&=25 \\\\\\ (y,z)&=(5,0) & 1\\cdot5+5\\cdot0+10\\cdot0&=25 \\\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$\n\nTherefore, there are 5 combinations of pennies, nickels, and dimes with a total value of 25 cents.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}.

        "ground_truth": "First, we count the number of combinations that include pennies: we could have all pennies, all pennies and one nickel, all pennies and two nickels, all pennies and three nickels, all pennies and four nickels, all pennies and one dime, all pennies and two dimes, all pennies and one dime and one nickel, all pennies and one dime and two nickels. As for the no pennies case, we can have five nickels, one dime and three nickels, two dimes and one nickel. So, there are $9 + 3 = \\boxed{12}$ combinations."
