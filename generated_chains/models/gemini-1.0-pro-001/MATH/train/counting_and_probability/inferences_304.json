At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf six people decide to come to a basketball game, but three of them are only 2/5 sure that they will stay for the entire time (the other three are sure they'll stay the whole time), what is the probability that at the end, at least 5 people stayed the entire time?",
        "inference": "Let's say the three people who are sure of staying are called A, B, and C, and the three who are 2/5 sure of staying are D, E, and F.\n\nThe probability that D stays is 2/5, so the probability that D leaves is 3/5. We can represent this with the binomial distribution:\n\nP(D stays) = 2/5\nP(D leaves) = 3/5\n\nThe same is true for E and F, so the probability that they leave is:\n\nP(E stays) = 2/5\nP(E leaves) = 3/5\n\nP(F stays) = 2/5\nP(F leaves) = 3/5\n\nWe want to find the probability that 5 or 6 people stay the entire time. We can do this by adding the probabilities of the following scenarios:\n\n1. A, B, C, D, and E stay\n2. A, B, C, D, and F stay\n3. A, B, C, E, and F stay\n\nThe probability of each of these scenarios is:\n\nP(1) = (1) * (1) * (1) * (2/5) * (2/5) = 8/125\nP(2) = (1) * (1) * (1) * (2/5) * (2/5) = 8/125\nP(3) = (1) * (1) * (1) * (2/5) * (2/5) = 8/125\n\nSo, the probability that 5 or more people stay is:\n\nP(1 or 2 or 3) = 8/125 + 8/125 + 8/125 = 24/125\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.192}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are two cases: 5 people and 6 people stayed.\n\nCase 1: 5 people stayed the whole time.  The probability that exactly 2 of those that are unsure stayed the entire time is $\\binom{3}{2}\\times \\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{3}{5}= 36/125$.\n\nCase 2: 6 people stayed the whole time.  The probability that all three unsure people stayed is $(2/5)^3 = 8/125$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\boxed{\\frac{44}{125}}$."
