At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)",
        "inference": "We can treat each group of the animals of the same type as one entity.  Then we have 4 entities to arrange, which can be done in 4!  ways.  The animals within each group can be arranged in 4!, 2!, and 5!  ways, respectively.  Multiplying these values, we get the total number of arrangements: \n$$4!\\cdot4!\\cdot2!\\cdot5!=24\\cdot24\\cdot2\\cdot120=69120.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{69120}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\\times 4!\\times 2!\\times 5!=\\boxed{34,\\!560}$."
