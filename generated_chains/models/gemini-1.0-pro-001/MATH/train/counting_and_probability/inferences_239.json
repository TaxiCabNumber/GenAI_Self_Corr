I hope it is correct.'\nAlice and Bob each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00. If Alice arrives after Bob, what is the probability that Bob arrived before 1:30?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** First, let's find the probability that Bob arrives before 1:30. This is the area under the probability density function from 1:00 to 1:30:\n\n```\nP(Bob < 1:30) = \u222b(1:00 to 1:30) f(x) dx\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Since the arrival times are uniformly distributed between 1:00 and 2:00, the probability density function is:\n\n```\nf(x) = 1 / (2:00 - 1:00) = 1 / 1:00 = 1\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Substituting this into the integral, we get:\n\n```\nP(Bob < 1:30) = \u222b(1:00 to 1:30) 1 dx = x |_(1:00 to 1:30) = 1:30 - 1:00 = 0.5\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Now, we want to find the probability that Alice arrives after Bob, given that Bob arrives before 1:30. This is the conditional probability:\n\n```\nP(Alice > Bob | Bob < 1:30) = P(Alice > Bob) / P(Bob < 1:30)\n```\n\n**Step 5:** The probability that Alice arrives after Bob is:\n\n```\nP(Alice > Bob) = 0.5\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Substituting this into the conditional probability formula, we get:\n\n```\nP(Alice > Bob | Bob < 1:30) = 0.5 / 0.5 = 1\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
