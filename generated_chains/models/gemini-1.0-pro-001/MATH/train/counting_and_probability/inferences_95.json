At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
        "inference": "There are 11 balls in total, and 5 of them are white.  The probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw is 5/11.  After the first ball is drawn, there are 10 balls remaining, and 4 of them are white.  The probability of drawing a white ball on the second draw is 4/10.  So, the probability of drawing two white balls is (5/11) * (4/10) = 2/11.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{2}{11}$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{11}{2} = 55$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{10}{55} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{11}}$."
