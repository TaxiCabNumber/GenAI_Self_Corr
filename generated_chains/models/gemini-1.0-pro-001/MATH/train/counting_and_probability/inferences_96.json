At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven sticks with lengths 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17 inches are placed in a box. Three of the sticks are randomly selected. What is the probability that a triangle can be formed by joining the endpoints of the sticks? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nThus, for the three sticks to form a triangle, the following three conditions must be met:\n\n1. The sum of the lengths of the two shortest sticks must be greater than the length of the longest stick.\n2. The sum of the lengths of the shortest and middle sticks must be greater than the length of the longest stick.\n3. The sum of the lengths of the middle and longest sticks must be greater than the length of the shortest stick.\n\nLet's check each condition:\n\n1. $2+3 > 17$ (True)\n2. $2+5 > 17$ (True)\n3. $5+7 > 2$ (True)\n\nSince all three conditions are met, a triangle can be formed from the three randomly selected sticks.\n\nThere are a total of $7 \\choose 3 = 35$ ways to select three sticks from the seven sticks.\n\nThe probability of selecting three sticks that can form a triangle is the number of ways to select three sticks that can form a triangle divided by the total number of ways to select three sticks:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{35}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{35}}$.

        "ground_truth": "By the triangle inequality, three segments form a triangle if and only if the sum of the smaller two lengths exceeds the greatest length.  Therefore, if $2$ is one of the sticks drawn, then the three sticks cannot be used to form a triangle.  If 3 is the smallest length drawn, then the possible sets of sticks are (3,5,7) and (3,11,13).  If 5 is the smallest length drawn, then (5,7,11), (5,11,13), and (5,13,17) are the sets that satisfy the triangle inequality.  If 7 is the smallest length drawn, then (7,11,13), (7,11,17), (7,13,17) all satisfy the triangle inequality.  Finally, (11,13,17) satisfies the triangle inequality.  In total, there are $2+3+3+1=9$ sets of sticks that could be used to form a triangle.  There are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ equally likely sets of 3 sticks, so the probability that one of the 9 sets that form a triangle will be chosen is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{35}}$."
