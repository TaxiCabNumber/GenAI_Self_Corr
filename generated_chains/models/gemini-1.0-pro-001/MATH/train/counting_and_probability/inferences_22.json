        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexio has 100 cards numbered 1-100, inclusive, and places them in a box. Alexio then chooses a card from the box at random. What is the probability that the number on the card he chooses is a multiple of 2, 3 or 5? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability that the number on the card is a multiple of 2 is 50/100 = 1/2.\nThe probability that the number on the card is a multiple of 3 is 33/100 = 1/3.\nThe probability that the number on the card is a multiple of 5 is 20/100 = 1/5.\nSo the probability that the number on the card is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 is the sum of these probabilities: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 = 11/15.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11/15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 50 numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are divisible by 2 --- all the even numbers. To avoid overcounting, we must find all the odd multiples of 3. Beginning with 3, the sequence of all such numbers is $3, 9, 15\\cdots99$, which gives $\\dfrac{99-3}{6}+1=17$ such numbers.\n\nFinally, we must find all odd multiples of 5 which are not divisible by 3. These are 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, and 95. This gives a final count of $50+17+7=74$ numbers between 1-100 inclusive which are multiples of 2, 3, or 5.\n\nThe probability that Alexio selects one of these is therefore $\\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{50}}$."
