At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNo two students in Mrs. Vale's 26-student mathematics class have the same two initials. Each student's first name and last name begin with the same letter. If the letter ``Y'' is considered a vowel, what is the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Students' first names and last names begin with the same letter, and there are 5 vowels.\nTherefore, there are $5$ possible first/last name initials (A, E, I, O, Y).\nSince no two students have the same two initials, the second initial must be a different vowel.\nTherefore, there are $4$ possible second initials (the remaining vowels).\nSo, the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels is $\\frac{5}{26}\\cdot\\frac{4}{25}=\\frac{1}{13}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{13}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The students' initials are AA, BB, CC, $\\cdots$, ZZ, representing all 26 letters. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y, which are 6 letters out of the possible 26. So the probability of picking a student whose initials are vowels is $\\frac{6}{26}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{13}}$."
