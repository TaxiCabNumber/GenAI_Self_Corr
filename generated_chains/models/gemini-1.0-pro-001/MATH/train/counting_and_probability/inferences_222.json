At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBertha has 6 daughters and no sons. Some of her daughters have 6 daughters, and the rest have none. Bertha has a total of 30 daughters and granddaughters, and no great-granddaughters. How many of Bertha's daughters and granddaughters have no daughters?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nBertha has 6 daughters and 30 daughters and granddaughters, so her daughters have 30 - 6 = 24 daughters.\nSince some of her daughters have 6 daughters and the rest have none, and all daughters have the same number of daughters, there must be 24 / 6 = 4 daughters with 6 daughters, and 6 - 4 = 2 daughters with no daughters.\nTherefore, the number of daughters and granddaughters with no daughters is **2**.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Bertha has $30 - 6 = 24$ granddaughters, none of whom have any daughters. The granddaughters are the children of $24/6 = 4$ of Bertha's daughters, so the number of women  having no daughters is $30 - 4 = \\boxed{26}$."
