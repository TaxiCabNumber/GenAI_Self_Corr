        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 6 shirts, 6 pairs of pants, and 6 hats.  Each item comes in the same 6 colors (so that I have one of each item of each color).  I refuse to wear an outfit in which all 3 items are the same color.  How many choices for outfits do I have?",
        "inference": "1st shirt can be any of the 6 colors.\n1st pants can be any of the 5 remaining colors.\n1st hat can be any of the 4 remaining colors.\n\nSo, the first outfit can be any of 6*5*4 = 120 outfits.\n\nThen we need to consider the 2nd, 3rd, ..., 6th outfit.\n\nThe 2nd outfit can be any of the 5*4*3 = 60 outfits.\nThe 3rd outfit can be any of the 4*3*2 = 24 outfits.\nThe 4th outfit can be any of the 3*2*1 = 6 outfits.\nThe 5th outfit can be any of the 2*1*1 = 2 outfits.\nThe 6th outfit is clearly 1 outfit.\n\nSo, the total number of choices for outfits is 120 + 60 + 24 + 6 + 2 + 1 = 213.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$213$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of all outfit combinations is $6\\times 6\\times 6=216$. There are 6 outfits in which all three items are the same color. Thus there are $216-6=\\boxed{210}$ outfits in which not all three items are the same color."
