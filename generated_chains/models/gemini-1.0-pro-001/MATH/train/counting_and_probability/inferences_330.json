At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\\{1, 2, 3, 6,9\\}$ is $9-6+3-2+1=5$ and for $\\{5\\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.\n",
        "inference": "Start with $n=2$. There is one subset of size $2$, with alternating sum $2-1=1$.  \n\nNext, $n=3$. There are three subsets of size $2$, with alternating sums $3-2=1$, $3-1=2$, and $2-1=1$.  There is also one subset of size $3$, with alternating sum $3-2+1=2$.  Adding, we obtain $1+1+1+2=5$.\n\nMoving on to $n=4$,  the subsets of size $2$ have alternating sums equal to those for $n=3$.  The subset of size $3$ has alternating sum $4-3+2=3$.  And the subset of size $4$ has alternating sum $4-3+2-1=2$.  Thus, the sum of the alternating sums is $5+3+2=10$.\n\nProceeding to $n=5$, we have $15$ subsets of size $2$, with sum $10$.  The subsets of size $3$ have, by the previous results, a sum of $5$.  The subset of size $4$ has alternating sum  $5-4+3-2=2$.  And the subset of size $5$ has alternating sum $5-4+3-2+1=3$.  In total, the sum of the alternating sums is $10+5+2+3=20$.\n\nFollowing a similar pattern, for $n=6$ the subsets of size $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$ have sums of $15$, $10$, $5$, and $3$ respectively.  The subset of size $6$ has alternating sum $6-5+4-3+2-1=3$.

The subset of size $7$ has alternating sum $7-6+5-4+3-2+1=4$.  In total, the sum of the alternating sums is $21+15+10+5+3+4=58$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$58$}. I hope it is correct.",
