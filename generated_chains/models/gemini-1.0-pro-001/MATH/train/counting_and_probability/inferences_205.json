I hope it is correct.'\nAllen and Bethany each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.  Each stays for 15 minutes, then leaves.  What is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party?",
        "inference": "Allen arrives at time A, and Bethany arrives at time B.  Since A and B are both random times between 1:00 and 2:00, they are uniformly distributed on [1, 2].  The probability that they do not see each other is the probability that A + 0.25 < B or A > B + 0.25.  Since A and B are independent, this probability is:\n\n$$\\begin{split} P(A+0.25<B \\text{ or } A>B+0.25) & = P(A+0.25<B) + P(A>B+0.25) \\\\\\ & = \\int_1^{1.75} \\int_{x-0.25}^{x+0.25} 1 \\text{ } dy \\text{ } dx + \\int_{1.75}^{2} \\int_{x-0.25}^{x+0.25} 1 \\text{ } dy \\text{ } dx  \\\\\\ & = \\int_1^{1.75} (0.5) \\text{ } dx + \\int_{1.75}^{2} (0.5) \\text{ } dx \\\\\\ & = 0.375 + 0.125 \\\\\\ & = 0.5 \\end{split}$$\n\nSo, the probability that they do see each other is:\n\n$$P(A+0.25<B \\text{ or } A>B+0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{0.5}.

For example, if Allen arrived at 1:30, Bethany could arrive at any time between 1:15 and 1:45 and see Allen at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This will be equal to $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{9}{16}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\\frac{9}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}$.  Since the area of the square is 1, this is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party."
