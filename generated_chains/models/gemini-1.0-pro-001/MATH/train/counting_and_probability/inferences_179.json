At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways is it possible to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5?",
        "inference": "To get a four-digit multiple of 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5.\n\nSince the number is 1150, there is only one 5.\n\nSo, the last digit must be 0.\n\nThe remaining three digits can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5.\nFinal Answer: $6$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A multiple of 5 has to end in 0 or 5. If it ends in 0, the three remaining digits can go anywhere. There are 3! ways to arrange 3 digits, but we must divide by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical. If the number ends in 5, the digit 0 can go in either of 2 places. Then the two remaining digits can go anywhere. There are 2! ways to arrange 2 digits, but we must divide this by 2! to correct for overcounting since the 1's are identical. So, there are $3!/2!+2\\cdot 2!/2!=3+2=\\boxed{5}$ possible ways to arrange the digits of 1150 to get a four-digit multiple of 5."
