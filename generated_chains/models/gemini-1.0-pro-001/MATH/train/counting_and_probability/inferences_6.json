At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNathan will roll two six-sided dice. What is the probability that he will roll a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of rolling a number less than 3 on the first die is 2/6 = 1/3.\nThe probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on the second die is 3/6 = 1/2.\nThe probability of both events happening is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1/6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the first die to be less than three, it must be a 1 or a 2, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. For the second die to be greater than 3, it must be a 4 or a 5 or a 6, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of both of these events occuring, as they are independent, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
