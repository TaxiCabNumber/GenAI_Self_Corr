At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCory has $3$ apples, $2$ oranges and $2$ bananas. If Cory eats one piece of his fruit per day for a week and the pieces of fruit within each category are indistinguishable, in how many orders can Cory eat the fruit? One such order is $AAAOOBB.$",

Thus, the number of ways of ordering all $7$ pieces of fruit is:\n\n$$3! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2! = 6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}.$ I hope it is correct.",
