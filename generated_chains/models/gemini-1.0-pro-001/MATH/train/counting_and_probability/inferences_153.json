At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 9 people sit around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",

        "ground_truth": "There are $9!$ ways to arrange 9 people in a line, however there are 9 identical rotations for each arrangement, so we divide by 9 to get $\\dfrac{9!}{9} = 8! = \\boxed{40,\\!320}$."
