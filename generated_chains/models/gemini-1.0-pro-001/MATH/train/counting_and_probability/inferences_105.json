At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour standard, six-sided dice are to be rolled. If the product of their values turns out to be an even number, what is the probability their sum is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The dice have six sides, so the product of their values can take any of 6^4 = 1296 different values. Half of these values are even. To find the probability that the product of the values is even, we divide the number of even products by the total number of possible products: 1/2\n\nIf the product of the values is even, then the sum can only be odd if the sum of the values is odd. To count the number of ways to get an odd sum, we notice that it does not matter which three of the four dice we choose to add, so there are 4 ways to choose the three dice. The sum of these three dice can take 6^3 = 216 different values, half of which are odd. To find the number of ways to get an odd sum, we multiply the number of ways to choose the three dice by the number of odd sums these three dice can take: 4 * 1/2 * 216 = 432\n\nTo find the probability that the sum is odd, given that the product is even, we divide the number of ways to get an odd sum with an even product by the total number of ways to get an even product: 432 / 648 = 3/4\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{4}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the product of their values is even, then at least one of the dice rolls must yield an even number. To find how many ways this is possible, we consider the complementary possibility: suppose that all of the dice rolls yield odd numbers. There are $3^4$ ways of this occurring, out of a total of $6^4$ possibilities. It follows that there are $6^4 - 3^4$ ways of obtaining at least one even value.\n\nNow, we need to count how many ways we can obtain an odd sum. There must then be an odd number of odd numbers rolled, so there must be either one or three odd numbers rolled. If one odd number is rolled, then there are $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the odd number, and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding a total of $4 \\cdot 3^4$ possibilities. If three odd numbers are rolled, then there are again $4$ ways to pick which die yielded the even number and $3$ possibilities for each dice, yielding $4 \\cdot 3^4$. Thus, the desired probability is given by $\\frac{4 \\cdot 3^4 + 4\\cdot 3^4}{6^4 - 3^4} = \\frac{8}{2^4 - 1} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{15}}$."
