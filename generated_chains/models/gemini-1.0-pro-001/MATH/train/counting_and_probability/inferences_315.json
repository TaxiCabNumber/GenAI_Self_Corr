At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bin has 8 black balls and 7 white balls.  3 of the balls are drawn at random.  What is the probability of drawing 2 of one color and 1 of the other color?",
        "inference": "Total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 15 balls = $^{15}C_3$ = 455.\n\nNumber of ways to draw 2 black and 1 white ball = $^{8}C_2$ x $^{7}C_1$ = 56.\n\nNumber of ways to draw 2 white and 1 black ball = $^{7}C_2$ x $^{8}C_1$ = 56.\n\nProbability of drawing 2 of one color and 1 of the other color = (Number of ways to draw 2 black and 1 white ball + Number of ways to draw 2 white and 1 black ball) / Total number of ways to draw 3 balls = (56 + 56) / 455 = 112 / 455 = 24 / 97.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{24}{97}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of ways to draw out 3 balls from 15 is $\\binom{15}{3}=455$.  We can choose 2 black balls and 1 white ball in $\\binom{8}{2}\\binom{7}{1}=196$ ways.  We can pick 1 black ball and 2 white balls in $\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{7}{2}=168$ ways.  Therefore we have $196+168=364$ ways to satisfy the condition, so the answer is $\\dfrac{364}{455}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
