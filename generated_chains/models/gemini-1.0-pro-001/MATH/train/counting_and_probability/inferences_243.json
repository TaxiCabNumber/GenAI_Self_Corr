At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe can choose 3 Republicans in ${8 \\choose 3}$ ways. We can choose 2 Democrats in ${6 \\choose 2}$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats is:\n\n${8 \\choose 3} \\times {6 \\choose 2}$\n\n= $\\frac{8!}{3!5!} \\times \\frac{6!}{2!4!}$\n\n= $\\frac{(8 \\times 7 \\times 6) \\times (6 \\times 5)}{120}$\n\n= $\\frac{336 \\times 30}{120}$\n\n= $\\frac{10080}{120}$\n\n= $84$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{84}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee."
