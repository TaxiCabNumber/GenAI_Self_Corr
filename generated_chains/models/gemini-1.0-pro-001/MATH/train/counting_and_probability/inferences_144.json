At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fair 6-sided die is rolled.  If the roll is even, then you win that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if you roll 4, then you win $\\$4$).  If the roll is odd, you win nothing.  What is the expected value of your winnings? Express your answer as a dollar value.",
