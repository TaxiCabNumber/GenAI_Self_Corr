At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circular dartboard is divided into regions with various central angles, as shown. The probability of a dart randomly landing in a particular region is $\\frac16$. What is the corresponding measure, in degrees, of the central angle of this section of the dartboard?

        "inference": "The probability of a dart randomly landing in a particular region is equal to the ratio of the central angle of that region to the sum of the central angles of all regions.\nSince the probability is $\\frac16$ and the sum of the central angles of all regions is $360^\\circ$, the central angle of the given region is $\\frac16\\cdot 360^\\circ =60^\\circ$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60^\\circ}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $A$ be the area of the circular dartboard.  If the measure of a central angle of a sector is $x$ degrees, then the area of the sector is $\\left(\\frac{x}{360}\\right)A$.  The probability of the dart landing in a region is ratio of the area of the region to the area of the dartboard, so  \\[\n\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{360}\\right)A}{A}.\n\\] Solve to find $x=\\boxed{60}$."
