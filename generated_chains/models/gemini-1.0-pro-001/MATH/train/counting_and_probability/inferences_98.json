At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nContainer A holds 4 red balls and 6 green balls; containers B and C each hold 6 red balls and 4 green balls. A container is selected at random and then a ball is randomly selected from that container. What is the probability that the ball selected is green? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "1. The probability of selecting any one of the three containers is 1/3.\n\n2. The probability of selecting a green ball from container A is 6/10 = 3/5.\n\n3. The probability of selecting a green ball from containers B or C is 4/10 = 2/5.\n\n4. The probability of selecting a green ball is:\n(1/3) * (3/5) + (2/3) * (2/5) = 3/5 + 4/15 = 9/15 = 3/5\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac35$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are three different possibilities for our first decision, each corresponding to which container we choose. So, if we choose container A, with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability, we have a $\\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$ probability of drawing green, which means we have  a $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ of picking Container A and then picking a green ball. Similarly for container B the probability is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{15}$, and the same for container C. So, the total probability is $\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{2}{15} =\\boxed{ \\frac{7}{15}}$."
