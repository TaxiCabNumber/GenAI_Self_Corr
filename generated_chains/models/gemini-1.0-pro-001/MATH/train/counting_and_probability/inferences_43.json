        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
        "inference": "1. There are 4 choices for the second letter.\n2. There are 3 choices for the third letter.\n3. There is only 1 choice for the fourth letter.\n\nSo, the total number of distinct sequences is 4 * 3 * 1 = 12.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences."
