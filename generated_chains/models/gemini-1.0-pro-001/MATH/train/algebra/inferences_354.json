        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWorking 22 hours in the second week of June, Xenia was able to earn $\\$$47.60 more than during the first week of June when she worked 15 hours. If her hourly wage was constant, how many dollars did she earn during the first two weeks of June? Express your answer to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find Xenia's hourly wage. Let's assume Xenia's hourly wage is $r$ dollars. Then, her earnings during the first week are $15r$ dollars and her earnings during the second week are $22r$ dollars.\n\n**Step 2:** Set up an equation based on the given information. According to the problem, Xenia earned $47.60 more during the second week than during the first week. So we can write:\n\n$$22r - 15r = 47.60$$\n\n**Step 3:** Solve the equation for $r$. Simplifying the equation:\n\n$$7r = 47.60$$\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n$$r = 6.8$$\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate Xenia's earnings during the first two weeks of June. Adding her earnings from both weeks:\n\nTotal earnings = (15 hours * $6.80/hour) + (22 hours * $6.80/hour)\n\n= $102.00 + $149.60\n\n= **$251.60**\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{251.60}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In those extra $22-15=7$ hours, she earned $7x$, where $x$ is her hourly rate. It follows that $x = \\frac{47.60}{7} = 6.8$. Thus she earned $(22+15)x = 37x = \\boxed{\\$ 251.60}$ over those two weeks."
