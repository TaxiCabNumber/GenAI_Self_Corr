At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y=-4.9t^2+3.5t+5$ describes the height (in meters) of a ball thrown upward at $3.5$ meters per second from $5$ meters above the ground, where $t$ is the time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe ball will hit the ground when its height is $0$. So, we need to solve the equation $-4.9t^2+3.5t+5=0$. We can do this by using the quadratic formula:\n\n$$t=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\n\nwhere $a=-4.9$, $b=3.5$, and $c=5$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$t=\\frac{-3.5\\pm\\sqrt{3.5^2-4(-4.9)(5)}}{2(-4.9)}$$\n\n$$t=\\frac{-3.5\\pm\\sqrt{12.25+98}}{-9.8}$$\n\n$$t=\\frac{-3.5\\pm\\sqrt{110.25}}{-9.8}$$\n\n$$t=\\frac{-3.5\\pm10.5}{-9.8}$$\n\nSo, the ball will hit the ground at $t=\\frac{-3.5+10.5}{-9.8}=\\frac{7}{-9.8}=\\boxed{-\\frac{7}{9.8}}$ seconds.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{7}{9.8}}$.
