At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many points of intersection are there between the graphs of the following equations: \\begin{align*}\ny &=|2x + 5|, \\\\\ny &= -|3x - 2|\n\\end{align*}",

Also, their zeros occur at different spots (in the former case, at $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$, in the latter, at $x = \\frac{2}{3}$).  Hence their graphs do not intersect, so our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$"
