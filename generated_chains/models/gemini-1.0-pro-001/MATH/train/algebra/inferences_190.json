        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPhoenix hiked the Rocky Path Trail last week. It took four days to complete the trip. The first two days she hiked a total of 22 miles. The second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day. The last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles. The total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles. How many miles long was the trail?",
        "inference": "Let x be the distance of the trail.\nSince the first two days, she hiked a total of 22 miles, so the first day she hiked (22 - 13) miles.\nSince the second and third days she averaged 13 miles per day, she hiked 13 miles on the second day and 13 miles on the third day.\nSince the last two days she hiked a total of 30 miles, so the fourth day she hiked (30 - 13) miles.\nSince the total hike for the first and third days was 26 miles, so the third day she hiked (26 - (22 - 13)) miles.\nTherefore, we have the equation\n(22 - 13) + 13 + (26 - (22 - 13)) + (30 - 13) = x\nSimplifying the equation\n9 + 13 + 17 + 17 = x\n56 = x\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$56$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of miles Phoenix hiked in each day be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=22\\\\\n(b+c)/2=13 \\Rightarrow b+c&=26\\\\\nc+d&=30\\\\\na+c&=26\n\\end{align*} Notice that we do not have to solve for any of the variables. We can add $a + b = 22$ to $c + d = 30$ and find that $a + b + c + d = 11 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 52.$ Therefore, the entire trail was $\\boxed{52}$ miles long."
