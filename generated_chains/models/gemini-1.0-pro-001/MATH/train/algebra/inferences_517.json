At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $x$ for which $|3x+5|$ is not positive? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "$|3x+5|$ is not positive when $3x+5$ is not positive. That is, when $3x+5<0$. Subtracting $5$ from both sides gives $3x<-5$. Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $x<-\\frac{5}{3}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
