So the midpoint of the first segment is $\\left(\\frac{0+2}{2}, \\frac{0+3}{2}\\right) = (1,1.5)$ and the midpoint of the second segment is $\\left(\\frac{5+6}{2}, \\frac{0+3}{2}\\right) = (5.5,1.5)$.  Note that the slope of the desired line must then be $\\boxed{0}$, since the $y$-coordinates of the two points are the same."
