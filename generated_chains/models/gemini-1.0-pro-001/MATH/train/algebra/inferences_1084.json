At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $c$ if the lines with equations $y = 8x + 2$ and $y = (2c)x - 4$ are parallel?",
        "inference": "Since the lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal.\nThe slope of the first line is $8$.\nThe slope of the second line is $2c$.\nSo we have:\n$$8=2c$$\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get:\n$$4=c$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$c=4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.  The slope of a line whose equation is $y = mx + b$ is $m$.  Thus $8 = 2c \\Rightarrow c = \\boxed{4}$."
