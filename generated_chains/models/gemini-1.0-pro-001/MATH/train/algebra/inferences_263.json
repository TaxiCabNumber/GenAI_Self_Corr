At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMickey's age is 4 years less than $300\\%$ of Jerry's age. If Mickey is 14 years old, how old is Jerry?",
        "inference": "Let Jerry's age be $x$.\nThen, $300\\%$ of Jerry's age is $3\\times\\frac{x}{100}=\\frac{3x}{100}$.\nMickey's age is $4$ years less than this, so Mickey's age is $\\frac{3x}{100}-4$.\nSince Mickey is $14$ years old, we have:\n$\\frac{3x}{100}-4=14$\nAdding $4$ to both sides, we get:\n$\\frac{3x}{100}=18$\nMultiplying both sides by $100$, we get:\n$3x=1800$\nDividing both sides by $3$, we get:\n$x=\\boxed{600}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{600}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $M$ and $J$ be the ages of Mickey and Jerry, respectively.  Then, $300\\%$ of Jerry's age is $3J$.  Since Mickey's age is 4 years less than $300\\%$ of Jerry's age, we have $M=3J - 4$.  We are given that $M = 14$, so $14 = 3J-4$.  Adding 4 to both sides gives $18 = 3J$, so $J=6$ and Jerry is $\\boxed{6}$ years old."
