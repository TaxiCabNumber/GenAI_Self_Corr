At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ are the coordinates of two opposite vertices of a rectangle, what is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices?",
        "inference": "The length of the rectangle is $9-3=6$ and the width is $17-(-4)=21$. The other two vertices are $(9,17)$ and $(3,-4)$. Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the other two vertices is $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The midpoints of the diagonals of a rectangle coincide, so the midpoint of the line segment joining $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ is also the midpoint of the line segment joining the other two vertices of the rectangle. The $y$-coordinate of a midpoint equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the two endpoints. Therefore, the average of the $y$-coordinates of $(3,17)$ and $(9,-4)$ equals the average of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices.  Since the sum is twice the average, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the missing vertices is the same as that of the given vertices: $17+(-4)=\\boxed{13}$."
