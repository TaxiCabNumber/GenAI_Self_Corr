        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
        "inference": "The shirt is initially discounted by 20%, so its price becomes $0.8\\times30=24$ dollars.\n\nThen, Mary applies her 25% discount, so the final price becomes $0.75\\times24=18$ dollars.\n\nTo find the equivalent single discount, we need to find the discount that would reduce the original price of $30$ dollars to $18$ dollars. Let $d$ be the discount rate. Then, we have\n\n$$30\\times(1-d)=18$$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get\n\n$$1-d=\\frac{18}{30}=0.6$$\n\n$$d=1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount."
