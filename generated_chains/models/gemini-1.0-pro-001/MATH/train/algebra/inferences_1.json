At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular band formation is a formation with $m$ band members in each of $r$ rows, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. A particular band has less than 100 band members. The director arranges them in a rectangular formation and finds that he has two members left over. If he increases the number of members in each row by 1 and reduces the number of rows by 2, there are exactly enough places in the new formation for each band member. What is the largest number of members the band could have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of members in the band. \nLet\u2019s identify the old formation as $r x$ where $r$ is the number of rows. \nWe know that $x$ is less than 100, so $x < 100$. \nIn the old formation, there are $rx$ members. We also know that $rx - 2 = x$. \nThis gives us $rx = x + 2$. \nWe also know that the director arranged the members in a new formation with $r-2$ rows and $x+1$ members in each row. \nSo, in the new formation, there are $(r-2)(x+1)$ members. We know that this is equal to $x$:\n$$(r-2)(x+1) = x$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (r-2)x+r-2=x$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (r-2)x-x=2-r$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (r-2-1)x=2-r$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (r-3)x=2-r$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{2-r}{r-3}$$\n$$x=\\frac{2-r}{r-3}=\\frac{2-(r-3)}{r-3}=\\frac{2-r+3}{r-3}=\\frac5{r-3}$$\nThe largest value of $x$ occurs when $r-3$ is as small as possible. \nSince $x$ is a whole number, $r-3$ should be a factor of $5$. \nThe smallest factor of $5$ greater than $3$ is $5$, so $r-3=5$ and $r=8$. \nTherefore, $x=\\frac5{r-3}=\\frac55=1$. \nThe largest possible number of members in the band is $x=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of band members in each row for the original formation, when two are left over.  Then we can write two equations from the given information: $$rx+2=m$$ $$(r-2)(x+1)=m$$ Setting these equal, we find: $$rx+2=(r-2)(x+1)=rx-2x+r-2$$ $$2=-2x+r-2$$ $$4=r-2x$$ We know that the band has less than 100 members.  Based on the first equation, we must have $rx$ less than 98.  We can guess and check some values of $r$ and $x$ in the last equation.  If $r=18$, then $x=7$, and $rx=126$ which is too big.  If $r=16$, then $x=6$, and $rx=96$, which is less than 98.  Checking back in the second formation, we see that $(16-2)(6+1)=14\\cdot 7=98$ as it should.  This is the best we can do, so the largest number of members the band could have is $\\boxed{98}$."
