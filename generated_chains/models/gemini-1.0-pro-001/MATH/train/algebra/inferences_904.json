I hope it is correct.'\nA swimming pool can be filled by any of three hoses A, B or C. Hoses A and B together take 4 hours to fill the pool. Hoses A and C together take 5 hours to fill the pool. Hoses B and C together take 6 hours to fill the pool. How many hours does it take hoses A, B and C working together to fill the pool? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "Let the total work be x.\n\nTime taken by A and B = x / 4\n\nTime taken by A and C = x / 5\n\nTime taken by B and C = x / 6\n\nTime taken by A, B, and C = $$\\frac{x}{\\frac{x}{4}+ \\frac{x}{5}+ \\frac{x}{6}}$$\n\n$$= \\frac{x}{\\frac{60x+48x+40x}{600}}$$\n\n$$=\\frac{600x}{148x}$$\n\n$$=4.05$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4.05$}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the rate that hose $A$ fills the pool be equal to $A$, and similarly for hoses $B$ and $C$.  Then, let $P$ be equal to the volume of the pool.  From the given information, we can write the equation $P=4(A+B)$, which just says the pool volume is equal to the rate it is being filled, multiplied by the time taken to fill it.  We can rewrite this as $\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$.  Doing this with the rest of the given information, we can write three equations: $$\\frac{P}{4}=A+B$$ $$\\frac{P}{5}=A+C$$ $$\\frac{P}{6}=B+C$$ Adding these three equations, we can simplify as shown: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{5}+\\frac{P}{6}&=(A+B)+(A+C)+(B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{15P}{60}+\\frac{12P}{60}+\\frac{10P}{60}&=2(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 37P&=120(A+B+C)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad P&=\\frac{120}{37}(A+B+C)\n\\end{align*} Looking carefully at the final expression here, we can see that $A+B+C$ is the rate that the pool would be filled with all three hoses working together.  So, $\\frac{120}{37}\\approx \\boxed{3.24}$ is equal to the number of hours it would take all three hoses to fill the pool."
