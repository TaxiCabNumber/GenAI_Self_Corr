I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $16x^2-106x-105$ can be written as $(8x + a)(2x + b),$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. What is $a + 2b$?",
        "inference": "The final question is to find the value of $a+2b$. \n\nTo start with, we need to find the value of $a$ and $b$. \n\nSince the factors of the first term of $16x^2$ is $8x$ and $2x$, the constant term $-105$ must be the product of their constant terms, so $a \\cdot b = -105$.\n\nThe middle term $-106x$ is $8x\\cdot b+2x\\cdot a$.\n\nThus $8b + 2a = -106$, or $4b + a = -53$.\n\nWe can use $a \\cdot b = -105$ to solve for $a$ or $b$.  Here we solve for $a$. \n\n$a = \\frac{-105}{b}$.\n\nSubstitute $a = \\frac{-105}{b}$ into $4b + a = -53$. \n\nThis gives $4b + \\frac{-105}{b} = -53$.\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by $b$.\n\nThis gives $4b^2 + (-105) = -53b$.\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$4b^2 + 105 = 53b$.\n\nSubtract $53b$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$4b^2 - 53b + 105 = 0$.\n\nSolve for $b$ using the quadratic formula:\n\n$b = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{(-53)^2 - 4 * 4 * 105}}{2 * 4} = \\frac{53 \\pm \\sqrt{1089}}{8}$.\n\nSince $b$ is an integer, $b = \\frac{53 + \\sqrt{1089}}{8}$ is not a solution.\n\nSo $b = \\frac{53 - \\sqrt{1089}}{8}$.\n\nFinally, substitute $b = \\frac{53 - \\sqrt{1089}}{8}$ into $a = \\frac{-105}{b}$ to get $a = \\frac{-105}{\\frac{53 - \\sqrt{1089}}{8}} = -15$.\n\nThus $a+2b = -15+2\\cdot \\frac{53 - \\sqrt{1089}}{8} = -15+\\frac{106 - 2\\sqrt{1089}}{8}=-1+\\frac{\\sqrt{1089}}{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1+\\frac{\\sqrt{1089}}{4}}$.

        "ground_truth": "We see that $16x^2-106x-105 = (8x + 7)(2x - 15)$, thus $a = 7$ and $b = -15$ and $a + 2b = \\boxed{-23}.$"
