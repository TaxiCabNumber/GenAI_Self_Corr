        "inference": "The quadratic equation $8x^2+15x+c=0$ has two real roots if and only if its discriminant is positive. The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $b^2-4ac$.\n\nIn this case, the discriminant is $15^2-4(8)(c)=225-32c$.\n\nWe want this to be positive, so $225-32c>0$, which gives $c<\\frac{225}{32}=7.03125$.\n\nTherefore, the product of all positive integer values of $c$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a quadratic to have two real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0. So we require \\begin{align*}15^2-4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot c &> 0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad 225-32c &> 0 \\\\ \\Rightarrow \\quad c&< \\frac{225}{32}.\\end{align*}The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{225}{32}$ is 7. Thus, the positive integer values of $c$ are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and their product is $\\boxed{5040}$."
