I hope it is correct.'\nGeorge purchases a sack of apples, a bunch of bananas, a cantaloupe, and a carton of dates for $ \\$ 20$. If a carton of dates costs twice as much as a sack of apples and the price of a cantaloupe is equal to the price of a sack of apples minus a bunch of bananas, how much would it cost George to purchase a bunch of bananas and a cantaloupe?",
        "inference": "Let the price of the apples be x, the price of the bananas be y, the price of the cantaloupe be z, and the price of the dates be w. Then we have:\n\n- x + y + z + w = $20\n- w = 2x\n- z + y = x\n\nSubstituting the second and third equations into the first, we have:\n\n- x + y + (x + y - x) + 2x = $20\n- 4x + 2y = $20\n- 2x + y = $10\n\nRearranging, we have:\n\n- y = $10 - 2x\n\n Substituting this into the equation z + y = x, we have:\n\n- z + $10 - 2x = x\n- z = 3x - $10\n\nTherefore, the cost of the bananas and the cantaloupe together is:\n\n- y + z = ($10 - 2x) + (3x - $10)\n- y + z = x - $10\n- y + z = $0\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$0}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the price of a sack of apples, $b$ the price of a bunch of bananas, $c$ the price of a cantaloupe, and $d$ the price of a carton of dates. We can express the information given in the problem by the following system of linear equations:  \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 20\\\\\n2a &= d\\\\\na-b &= c\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation for $c$ and $d$ gives $a + b + a - b + 2a = 20$, which simplifies to $4a = 20$, so $a = 5$. From here, we use $a$ to find $d = 2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. We put these values into the first equation to get $5 + b + c + 10 = 20$, so $b + c = \\boxed{ \\$ 5}$."
