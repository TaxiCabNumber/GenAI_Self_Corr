I hope it is correct.'\nOn Monday at work, David produces $w$ widgets per hour, and works for $t$ hours. Exhausted by this work, on Tuesday, he decides to work for $2$ fewer hours, but manages to produce $4$ additional widgets per hour. If $w = 2t$, how many more widgets did David produce on Monday than on Tuesday?",

The difference in the number of widgets he produced on Monday and Tuesday is:\n\n\n$$wt-(w+4)(t-2)=wt-(wt-2w+4t-8)$$\n\n$$=wt-wt+2w-4t+8$$\n\n$$=2w-4t+8$$\n\nSince $w=2t$, we have:\n\n$$2w-4t+8=2(2t)-4t+8=4t-4t+8=8$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$.
