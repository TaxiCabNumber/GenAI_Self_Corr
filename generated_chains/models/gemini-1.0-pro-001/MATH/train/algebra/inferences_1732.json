At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many values of $x$ is the expression $\\frac{x^2-9}{(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)}$ undefined?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe expression is undefined when the denominator is equal to 0.  Therefore, we solve the equation $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$.  Factoring, we get $(x+3)(x-1)(x-3)=0$.  Therefore, the expression is undefined when $x=-3$, $x=1$, or $x=3$.  There are $\\boxed{3}$ such values of $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero, so we are looking for values of $x$ that satisfy $(x^2+2x-3)(x-3)=0$. This polynomial factors further as $(x-1)(x+3)(x-3)=0$, giving us the solutions $x=1$, $x=-3$ and $x=3$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ values of $x$ for which the expression is undefined."
