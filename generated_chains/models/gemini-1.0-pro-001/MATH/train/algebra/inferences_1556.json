        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLaura is training for a triathlon, but she doesn't feel like swimming. She bikes $20$ miles at $2x+1$ miles per hour, spends five minutes parking her bike, changing to her running shoes, and catching a drink of water, and then runs $5$ miles at $x$ miles per hour. Her total workout lasts $110$ minutes. How fast did Laura run, to the nearest hundredth of a mile per hour?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",

        "ground_truth": "Since Laura spends $5$ minutes in transition, a total of $110-5=105$ minutes are spent in motion. This is equivalent to $\\frac{105}{60}=1.75$ hours. We know that $\\text{distance}=\\text{rate}\\cdot\\text{time}$, so $\\text{time}=\\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}}$. Thus the time Laura spends biking is $\\frac{20\\text{ miles}}{2x+1\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{20}{2x+1}\\text{ hours}$, and the time she spends running is $\\frac{5\\text{ miles}}{x\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{5}{x}\\text{ hours}$.
