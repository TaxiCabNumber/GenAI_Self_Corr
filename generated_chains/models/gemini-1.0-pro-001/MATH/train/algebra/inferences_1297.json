        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo numbers have a difference of 3 and a sum of 31. What is the larger of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We know that \\(x - y = 3\\) and \\(x + y = 31\\). We can solve for \\(x\\) in the first equation to get \\(x = y + 3\\). We can then substitute this into the second equation to get \\(y + 3 + y = 31\\). Solving for \\(y\\), we get \\(y = 14\\). Therefore, the larger of the two numbers is \\(x = y + 3 = 17\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$17$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$.  We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$.  Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$.  Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$."
