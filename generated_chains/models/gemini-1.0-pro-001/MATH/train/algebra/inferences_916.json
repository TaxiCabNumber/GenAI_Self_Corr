At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest value of $x$ such that the expression \\[\\dfrac{x+1}{8x^2-65x+8}\\] is not defined?",
        "inference": "The expression is not defined when the denominator is equal to zero. So we solve the equation:\n\n$$8x^2-65x+8=0$$\n\n$$(8x-1)(x-8)=0$$\n\n$$x=\\frac{1}{8} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x=8$$\n\nThe largest value of $x$ that makes the expression undefined is $x=8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In this particular case, the fraction will be undefined only if its denominator is equal to zero. Because of this, we can ignore the numerator. We start by setting the binomial in the denominator equal to 0: \\begin{align*} 8x^2-65x+8=0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (8x-1)(x-8)=0\n\\end{align*} We find that the two possible values for $x$ are $\\frac18$ and $8$. Since the question asks for the largest value, the final solution is $\\boxed{8}$."
