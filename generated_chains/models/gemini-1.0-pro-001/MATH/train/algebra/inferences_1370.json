At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA super ball is dropped from 100 feet and rebounds half the distance it falls each time it bounces. How many feet will the ball have traveled when it hits the ground the fourth time?",
