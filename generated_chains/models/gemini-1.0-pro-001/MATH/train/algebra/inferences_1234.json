At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the largest value of $n$ such that $3x^2 +nx + 72$ can be factored as the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients.",
        "inference": "First, we find the discriminant of the quadratic: $n^2 - 4(3)(72) = n^2 - 864$. For the quadratic to factor into two linear factors with integer coefficients, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $n^2 - 864 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\pm \\sqrt{864 + k^2}$. Since $n$ is an integer, the only possible values for $k$ are $k = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 12, \\pm 18, \\pm 24, \\pm 36, \\pm 48, \\pm 72$. Evaluating $n$ for each of these values of $k$, we find that the largest possible value of $n$ is $n = \\boxed{48}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "When we factor $3x^2 + nx + 72$, our two factors are of the form $(3x + A)(x+B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are integers.  We must have $AB = 72$, and we want $3B +A$ to be as large as possible (because $3B+A$ is the coefficient of $x$ when $(3x+A)(x+B)$ is expanded). We make $3B + A$ as large as possible by letting $B=72$ and $A=1$; any other possibility reduces $3B$ much more than $A$ increases.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $n$ is $3B+A = 3(72) +1 =\\boxed{217}$."
