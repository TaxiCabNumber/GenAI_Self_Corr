At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Marika's $8^{\\text{th}}$ birthday, in 2004, her father said, ''My age is now four times your age.'' In what year will Marika's father be able to say, ''My age is now three times your age,'' on Marika's birthday?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's start by finding Marika's father's age when he said: \"My age is now four times your age.\"\n\nIf Marika was 8 in 2004, her father's age would have been 4 x 8 = 32.\n\nLet's assume Marika's father will be able to say: \"My age is now three times your age,\" when Marika is x years old. In this case, x represents the year.\n\nIf Marika is x years old, her father's age would be 3 x x = 3x.\n\nWe know that Marika's father's age was 32 when Marika was 8. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n3x = 32\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nx = 10.666666...\n\nSince Marika cannot be a fraction of a year old, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 11.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\\\boxed{2014}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Marika is 8 years old, and her father is four times her age, then her father is $4\\cdot 8 = 32$ years old. So now $x$ years after 2004, Marika will be $8+x$ years old and her father will be $32+x$ years old. If the father's age is three times Marika's age then: \\begin{align*}\n32+x &= 3(8+x)\\\\\n32+x &= 24+3x\\\\\n2x &= 8\\\\\nx &=4\n\\end{align*}So the year is $2004+4 = \\boxed{2008}$."
