At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJuan, Carlos and Manu take turns flipping a coin in their respective order. The first one to flip heads wins. What is the probability that Manu will win? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of flipping tails on any given turn is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that Juan flips tails is 1/2.\n\nIf Juan flips tails, the probability that Carlos flips tails is also 1/2.\n\nIf both Juan and Carlos flip tails, the probability that Manu flips heads is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Manu will win is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{8}$}.

        "ground_truth": "For Manu to win on his first turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTH, which has probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3$.  For Manu to win on his second turn, the sequence of flips would have to be TTTTTH, which has probability $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^6$.  Continuing, we find that the probability that Manu wins on his $n$th turn is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3n}$.  The probability that Manu wins is the sum of these probabilities, which is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^6}+\\frac{1}{2^9}+\\cdots=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2^3}}{1-\\frac{1}{2^3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}},\n\\] where we have used the formula $a/(1-r)$ for the sum of an infinite geometric series whose first term is $a$ and whose common ratio is $r$."
