        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the two solutions to the equation $54-15x-x^2=0$?",
        "inference": "$$54-15x-x^2=0$$ $$-x^2-15x+54=0$$ $$-(x^2+15x-54)=0$$ $$-(x^2+18x-3x-54)=0$$ $$-[(x^2+18x)-(3x+54)]=0$$ $$-[x(x+18)-3(x+18)]=0$$ $$-(x+18)(x-3)=0$$ $$\\therefore x=-18,3$$ **Final Answer: $\\boxed{-15}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the two solutions are $r$ and $s$, then the left-hand side of the equation may be factored as $-(x-r)(x-s)$. When multiplied out, this expression takes the form $-x^2+(r+s)x-rs$.  Therefore, $r+s$ is the coefficient of $x$ in the equation, namely $\\boxed{-15}$."
