        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $(x^2 - k)(x + k) = x^3 + k(x^2 - x - 5)$ and $k\\neq 0$, what is the value of $k$?",
        "inference": "$$(x^2 - k)(x + k) = x^3 + k(x^2 - x - 5)$$\n$$x^3 + k(x^2 - x - 5) = x^3 + kx^2 - kx - 5k$$\n$$k(x^2 - x - 5) = kx^2 - kx - 5k$$\n$$k(x^2 - x - 5) = k(x^2 - x - 5)$$\nTherefore, $k$ can be any nonzero value.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{k\\ is\\ any\\ nonzero\\ value.}$**",
        "ground_truth": "If we multiply $(x^2 - k)$ by $(x + k)$, we get $x^3 + kx^2 - kx - k^2$. We can now factor out a $k$ from the last three terms of this expression, which gives us $x^3 + k(x^2 - x - k)$. When we set this equal to the right side of the original equation $x^3 + k(x^2 -x - 5)$, we get $x^3 + k(x^2 - x - k) = x^3 + k(x^2 - x - 5)$. A careful comparison of the two sides of this equation reveals that $k$ must be 5 (consider the constant terms). Alternatively, we could multiply out both sides of the equation and get $x^3 + kx^2 - kx - k^2 = x^3 + kx^2 - kx - 5k$. The left side and the right side are the exact same when $k^2 = 5k$, so $k = \\boxed{5}$."
