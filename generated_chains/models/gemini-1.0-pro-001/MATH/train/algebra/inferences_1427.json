At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe bacteria in a lab dish double in number every four hours. If 500 bacteria cells are in the dish now, in how many hours will there be exactly 32,000 bacteria?",
        "inference": "Every four hours, the number of bacteria will double, meaning that each time four hours pass, the number of bacteria will be double the previous number. This means that a function that represents the number of bacteria cells as a function of the number of four-hour periods that have passed will have an exponent of 2.\n\nIf there are 32,000 bacteria after $h$ four-hour periods, we can write an equation to represent this:\n\n$$32,000 = 500(2)^h$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $h$ by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n\n$$\\log_2(32,000) =h $$\n\n$$\\log_2(32,000)/\\log_2(2) = h \\ (by \\ log \\ a/log \\ b = log_a ^b )$$\n\n$$5 = h$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours."
