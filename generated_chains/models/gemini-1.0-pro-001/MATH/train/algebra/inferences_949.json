        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe variables $a$ and $b$ are inversely proportional. When the sum of $a$ and $b$ is 24, their difference is 6. What is $b$ when $a$ equals 5?",
        "inference": "Let $y$ be the constant of proportionality. Then $a=\\frac{y}{b}$. We know that $a+b=24$, so $\\frac{y}{b}+b=24$, or $24b=y+b^2$. We also know that $a-b=6$, so $\\frac{y}{b}-b=6$, or $6b=y-b^2$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $18b=2b^2$, or $b^2-9b=0$. Factoring, we get $b(b-9)=0$, so $b=0$ or $b=9$. Since $b$ cannot be $0$, we have $b=9$.\n\nWhen $a=5$, we have $a+b=24$, so $b=24-a=24-5=\\boxed{19}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19}$",
        "ground_truth": "We know that when $a+b=24$, $a-b=6$. Adding these two equations gives $2a=30$, or $a=15$, and subtracting the second from the first gives $2b=18$, or $b=9$. Since $a$ and $b$ are inversely proportional, the product $ab$ is always the same. Call this product $C$. From the values of $a$ and $b$ we were given, we know that $C=ab=(15)(9)=135$. To find the value of $b$ when $a=5$, we solve the equation $(5)(b)=135$. This gives $b=\\boxed{27}$."
