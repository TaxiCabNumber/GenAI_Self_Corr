        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAddison's age is three times Brenda's age. Janet is six years older than Brenda. Addison and Janet are twins. How old is Brenda?",
        "inference": "Let Brenda's age be \\(x\\).\nThen, Addison's age is \\(3x\\).\nAnd, Janet's age is \\(x+6\\).\nGiven, Addison and Janet are twins.\nSo \\(3x=x+6\\).\n\\(3x-x=6\\).\n\\(2x=6\\).\n\\(x=6/2=3\\).\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, let $A = $ Addison's age, $B = $ Brenda's age, and $J = $ Janet's age. Then, from the statements given, we have the following system of equations:  $$\\begin{cases}\nA=3B \\\\\nJ = B+6 \\\\\nA=J\n\\end{cases} $$ Since $A=J$, we know that $3B=B+6$. Solving this equation, we have that $2B = 6 \\Rightarrow B=3$. Thus, Brenda is $\\boxed{3}$ years old."
