        "ground_truth": "To get from the seventh term to the tenth term, we multiply the seventh term by 3 ($7\\times3=21$).

The $13$th term is $21\\times3=\\boxed{63}$.\n\nTo be more specific, we can write the eighth term as $7r$, where $r$ is the common ratio of the geometric sequence. The ninth term is $7r^2$, the tenth term is $7r^3$, etc. If $7r^3=21$, then $r^3=3$. So $a_n=a_{n-3}r^3=3a_{n-3}$. We get the $13$th term with $3a_{10}=3\\times21=\\boxed{63}$."
