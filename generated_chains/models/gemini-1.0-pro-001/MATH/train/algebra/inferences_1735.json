        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo lines defined by the equations $y = mx + 4$ and $y = 3x + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, intersect at the point $(6, 10)$. What is the value of $b + m$?",
        "inference": "Substituting $y = 10$ into the first equation gives $10 = m(6) + 4 \\Rightarrow m = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $y = 10$ into the second equation gives $10 = 3(6) + b \\Rightarrow b = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $b + m = 2 + 1 = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the two lines intersect at $(6,10)$, each must pass through that point.  So, we can substitute this point for $x$ and $y$ in the two given equations, then solve for $m$ and $b$.  In the first equation we find: \\begin{align*}\n10&=m(6)+4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=6m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=m\n\\end{align*} Using the same method in the second equation gives: \\begin{align*}\n10&=3(6)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10&=18+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -8&=b\n\\end{align*} The value of $b+m$ is equal to $1+(-8)=\\boxed{-7}$."
