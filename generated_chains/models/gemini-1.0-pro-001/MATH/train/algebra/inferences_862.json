At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Given quadratic equation is $2x^2 - 5x + k = 0$ with one solution for $x$. Then the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be zero. That is, \n$$(-5)^2 - 4(2)(k) = 0$$ $$\\Rightarrow 25 - 8k = 0$$ $$\\Rightarrow 8k = 25$$ $$\\Rightarrow k = \\frac{25}{8}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the quadratic equation has exactly one solution, then the discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot k = 25 - 8k$, must be equal to zero. Thus, $25 - 8k = 0 \\Longrightarrow k = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$."
