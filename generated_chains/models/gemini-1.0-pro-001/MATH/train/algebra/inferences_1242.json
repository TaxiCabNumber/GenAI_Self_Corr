At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of a triangle in the Cartesian plane equals $10$.  Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of the triangle.",
        "inference": "The $x$-coordinate of the midpoint of the side from $(x_1,y_1)$ to $(x_2,y_2)$ is $\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}$.\nSo, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides is:\n$\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} + \\frac{x_2+x_3}{2} + \\frac{x_3+x_1}{2} = \\frac{2(x_1+x_2+x_3)}{2} = x_1+x_2+x_3$\nSince the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices is $10$, we have $x_1+x_2+x_3 = 10$.\nTherefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides is $\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices be $a,b,c$.  Then the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides are $\\frac{a+b}2,\\frac{a+c}2,\\frac{b+c}2$.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2a+2b+2c}2=a+b+c$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{10}$."
