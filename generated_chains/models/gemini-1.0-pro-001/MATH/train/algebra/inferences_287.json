        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe difference between two positive integers is 12 and their product is 45. What is the sum of the integers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two integers $x$ and $y$. We know that $x - y = 12$ and $xy = 45$. We can use these two equations to solve for $x$ and $y$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $x = y + 12$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $(y + 12)y = 45$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $y^2 + 12y - 45 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(y - 3)(y + 15) = 0$. Therefore, $y = 3$ or $y = -15$.\n\nSince $y$ is a positive integer, we have $y = 3$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $x = 15$. Therefore, the sum of the integers is $x + y = 15 + 3 = \\boxed{18}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $x$ and $y$ with $x>y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx-y&=12\\\\\nxy&=45\n\\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \\[(x-y)^2=12^2\\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=144\\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\\cdot45=180$. Adding these last two equations, we have \\[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=144+180 \\Rightarrow (x+y)^2=324 \\Rightarrow x+y = 18\\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{18}$."
