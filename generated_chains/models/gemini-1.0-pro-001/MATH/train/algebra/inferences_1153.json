        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 6. The difference of their squares is 12. What is the positive difference of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two numbers x and y. We know that x + y = 6, and x^2 - y^2 = 12. We can use the first equation to substitute for y in the second equation:\n\n```\nx^2 - (6 - x)^2 = 12\n```\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n```\nx^2 - (36 - 12x + x^2) = 12\n```\n\n```\n2x^2 - 36 + 12x = 12\n```\n\n```\n2x^2 + 12x - 48 = 0\n```\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n```\n(2x - 6)(x + 8) = 0\n```\n\nSo, either 2x - 6 = 0 or x + 8 = 0. Solving for x, we get:\n\n```\nx = 3 or x = -8\n```\n\nSince we are looking for the positive difference of the two numbers, we will take the positive value of x, which is x = 3. Substituting this back into x + y = 6, we get:\n\n```\n3 + y = 6\n```\n\n```\ny = 3\n```\n\nSo, the two numbers are 3 and 3. The positive difference of these two numbers is:\n\n```\n3 - 3 = 0\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the two numbers $x$ and $y$. We are given that $x+y = 6$ and $x^2 - y^2 = 12$. Because $x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, we can substitute in for $x+y$, giving $6(x-y) = 12$, or $x-y = \\boxed{2}$."
