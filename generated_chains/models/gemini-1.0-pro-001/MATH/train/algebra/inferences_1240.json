        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a$ and $b$ be the solutions of the equation $2x^2+6x-14=0$. What is the value of $(2a-3)(4b-6)$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Solve the quadratic equation for $a$ and $b$.\n$$2x^2+6x-14=0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (2x-2)(x+7)=0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=1 \\text{ or } x=-7$$\nSo, $a=1$ and $b=-7$.\n\n**Step 2:** Evaluate the expression.\n$$(2a-3)(4b-6) = (2(1)-3)(4(-7)-6)$$\n$$= (-1)(-30)$$\n$$= 30$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$. This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $-6/2=-3$ and $-14/2=-7$, respectively. Thus, the desired expression equals $(8\\cdot -7) - (12 \\cdot -3) + 18 = \\boxed{-2}$."
