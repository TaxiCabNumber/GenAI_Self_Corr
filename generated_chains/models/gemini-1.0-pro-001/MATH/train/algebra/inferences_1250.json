At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSamson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "Monday:\nUtility = (8 - t)t = 8t - t^2\n\nTuesday:\nUtility = (t + 3)(2 - t) = 2t - t^2 + 6 - 3t\nUtility = -t^2 + t + 6\n\n8t - t^2 = -t^2 + t + 6\n7t = 6\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$t = \\frac{6}{7}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
