At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x) = -7x^4 + 3x^3 + x - 5$, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial such that the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, then what is the degree of $g(x)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is the larger of the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 4, the degree of $g(x)$ must be $1 - 4 = \\boxed{-3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, and the only way that $g(x)$ can cancel the term of $-7x^4$ in $f(x)$ is if $g(x)$ contains the term $7x^4$.  Therefore, the degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
