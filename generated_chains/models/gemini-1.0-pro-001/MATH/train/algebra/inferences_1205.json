At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cylindrical water tank is $\\frac{1}{5}$ full. If three liters were added, the tank would be $\\frac{1}{4}$ full. How many liters does the tank hold when it is full?",
        "inference": "Let the full capacity of the tank be x liters.\nWhen the tank is $\\frac{1}{5}$ full, it contains $\\frac{1}{5}x$ liters of water.\nWhen three liters are added, the total volume of water in the tank becomes $\\frac{1}{5}x + 3$ liters.\nSince the tank is then $\\frac{1}{4}$ full, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{5}x + 3 = \\frac{1}{4}x$$\nSolving for x:\n$$\\begin{split} \\frac{1}{5}x + 3 &= \\frac{1}{4}x \\\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{5}x &= 3 \\\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad\\frac{1}{20}x &= 3 \\\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\qquad x &= 60 \\end{split}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the number of liters of water in the tank originally be $w$, and let the number of liters of water the tank can hold when it is full be $c$. Originally, we have the equation $\\frac{w}{c}=\\frac{1}{5}$. Cross multiplying, we have $c = 5w$, or $w=\\frac{c}{5}$. After three liters of water are added, we have the equation $\\frac{w+3}{c} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Cross multiplying, we have $c=4w+12$. Substituting the previous expression for $w$ into this last equation to eliminate $w$, we get $c=4(\\frac{c}{5})+12$, or $c=60$. Thus, the number of liters of water the tank can hold is $\\boxed{60}$."
