At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe amount of algae covering the Smith's backyard pond doubled every day until it was completely covered in algae on day $30$ of the month. On what day of that month was $75\\%$ of the pond algae-free?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $d$ be the day when 75% of the pond is algae-free. If the amount of algae doubles every day, then the fraction of the pond that is algae-free on day $d$ is $\\frac{1}{2}^{30-d}$. Since the pond is 75% algae-free on day $d$, we have the equation\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}^{30-d} = 0.75.$$Solving for $d$, we get $$30-d = \\log_2{0.75} = -1 \\Rightarrow d = \\boxed{31}.$$**Final Answer: $\\boxed{31}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We are trying to find the day of the month on which the pond was $75\\%$ algae-free, or the day when the pond was $25\\%$ covered. On day $30$ of the month the pond was completely covered, and the amount of algae doubled every day. This means that on day $29$, the pond was half covered in algae, and therefore on day $\\boxed{28}$ the pond was $25\\%$ covered in algae."
