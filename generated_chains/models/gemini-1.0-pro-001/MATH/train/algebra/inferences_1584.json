        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area of the region enclosed by the graph of the equation $x^2-14x+3y+70=21+11y-y^2$ that lies below the line $y=x-3$?",
        "inference": "The given equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$x^2-14x+4y-y^2-49=0$$\n\n$$(x-7)^2-y^2=49$$\n\nThis is the equation of a hyperbola with center at (7,0), vertices at (7,7) and (7,-7), and asymptotes $y=\\pm (x-7)$.\n\nThe area of the region enclosed by the hyperbola and the line $y=x-3$ is the area of the region below the hyperbola and above the line, which is the area of the triangle with vertices (7,7), (7,-7), and (10,7).\n\n$$Area=\\frac{1}{2}(7+7)(14)=98$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{98}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The equation can be rewritten as \\begin{align*}\nx^2-14x+y^2-8y & =-49\\\\\nx^2-14x+49+y^2-8y+16& =16\\\\\n(x-7)^2+(y-4)^2 & =16\n\\end{align*}Thus, the region is a circle with center $(7,4)$ and radius 4. As $(7,4)$ is on the line $y=x-3$, the line passes through the center of the circle. Hence, half of the area of the circle lies below the line $y=x-3$. The radius of the circle is 4, so the circle has area $16\\pi$. Therefore, half the area of the circle is $\\boxed{8 \\pi}$."
