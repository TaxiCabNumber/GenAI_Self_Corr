At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat number results when 50 is increased by $120\\%$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n120% of 50 is $0.12\\times 50=6$.\n\nSo, 50 increased by 120% is $50+6=\\boxed{$56$}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$56$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Because $120\\%$ of 50 is $1.2(50) = 60$, when we increase 50 by $120\\%$, we get $50 + 60 = \\boxed{110}$.  Alternatively, we could find our answer by multiplying 50 by $1 + 1.2 = 2.2$, which also gives us $\\boxed{110}$."
