At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe positive difference between the two roots of the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 7x - 8 = 0$ can be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $n$ is an integer and $m$ is an integer not divisible by the square of any prime number.

        "ground_truth": "The roots of the equation are given by $\\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8}}{2 \\cdot 3}$. When taking their difference, the term $7$ in the numerator cancels out, so the difference is $2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{7^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{145}}{3}$. Thus, the answer is $145 + 3 = \\boxed{148}$."
