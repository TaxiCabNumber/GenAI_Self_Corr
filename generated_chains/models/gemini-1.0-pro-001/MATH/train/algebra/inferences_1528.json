        "ground_truth": "Observe first that $x=0$ is not a solution to the equation since it makes the denominator of $\\frac{1}{2x}$ equal to 0.  For $x\\neq 0$, we may multiply both sides by both denominators and move all the resulting terms to the left-hand side to get $2x^2-2rx+7=0$. Observe that there are two ways the original equation could have exactly one solution.  Either $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has two solutions and one of them is 0, or else $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has exactly one nonzero solution.

Setting $(-2r)^2-4(2)(7)$ equal to 0 gives $4r^2-4(14) = 0$.  Add 4(14) and divide by 4 to find $r^2=14$.
