At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAll positive integers whose digits add up to 11 are listed in increasing order:  $29, 38, 47, ...$. What is the eleventh number in that list?",
        "inference": "The digits of a positive integer add up to 11 if and only if the integer is of the form $10a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits such that $a+b=11$.\n\nThere are 10 choices for $a$ (from 0 to 9) and 2 choices for $b$ (from 0 to 1). Therefore, there are $10\\times2=20$ positive integers whose digits add up to 11.\n\nThe eleventh number in the list is the $11$th positive integer whose digits add up to 11.\n\nTherefore, the eleventh number in the list is $10\\times1+1=11$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To generate the next 2-digit number on this list, we just increment the tens digit of the current one and decrement the ones.  Thus the 8th number on the list will be 92.  The first 3-digit number is 119, which is the 9th number in the list.  Continuing the earlier pattern, the 10th is 128, and the 11th is $\\boxed{137}$."
