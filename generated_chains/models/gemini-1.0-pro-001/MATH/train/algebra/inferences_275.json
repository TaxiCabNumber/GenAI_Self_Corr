At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes Mary 30 minutes to walk uphill 1 km from her home to school, but it takes her only 10 minutes to walk from school to home along the same route. What is her average speed, in km/hr, for the round trip?",
        "inference": "Walking uphill 1 km takes 30 minutes, therefore, to walk 2 km (the round trip) takes 60 minutes. Walking downhill 1 km takes 10 minutes, therefore, to walk 2 km (the round trip) takes 20 minutes. \n\nThe average speed, in km/hr, is the distance travelled, divided by the time taken. In this case, the distance travelled is 2 km, and the time taken is (60 + 20) / 60 = 13 / 3 hours. Therefore, the average speed is 2 / (13 / 3) = 6 / 13 km/hr.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{6/13}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Mary walks a total of 2 km in 40 minutes. Because 40 minutes is 2/3  hr, her average speed, in km/hr, is  $\\dfrac{2\\text{ km}}{2/3\\text{ hr}} = \\boxed{3}\\text{ km/hr}.$"
