        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor real numbers $x$, let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nx+2 &\\text{ if }x>3, \\\\\n2x+a &\\text{ if }x\\le 3.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\]What must the value of $a$ be to make the piecewise function continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper)?",
        "inference": "If the piecewise function is continuous, the value of $f(x)$ must be the same for both expressions at $x=3$. Therefore,\n$$3+2=2(3)+a$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 5=6+a$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow a=-1$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the function to be continuous, both of the two expressions must have the same value when $x=3$. Therefore, $3+2=2(3)+a$. Solving, we get that $a=\\boxed{-1}$."
