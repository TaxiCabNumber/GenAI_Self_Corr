        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour primes $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence with $a > 5$ and common difference 6. What is the ones digit of $a$?",
        "inference": "We have $a > 5$ and $d = 6$. So $a = 6k + r$ where $k \\ge 1$ and $0 \\le r \\le 5$. Since $a$ is prime, $r$ must be $1$ or $5$.\nSince $a$, $a + 6$, $a + 12$ and $a + 18$ are all prime, $r$ must be $1$. So $a = 6k + 1$.\nTherefore, the ones digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every prime number greater than 5 has a ones digit of 1, 3, 7, or 9.  For each of these digits, let's add 6, take the resulting ones digit, and repeat the process two more times. We get the following sequences of digits. \\begin{align*}\n1, 7, 3, 9 \\\\\n3, 9, 5, 1 \\\\\n7, 3, 9, 5 \\\\\n9, 5, 1, 7\n\\end{align*} Only the first of these sequences could be the sequence of ones digits of four prime numbers, since each of the other three sequences contains 5.  Therefore, the units digit of $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$. The example $a=11$ shows that there exists such a sequence of consecutive prime numbers."
