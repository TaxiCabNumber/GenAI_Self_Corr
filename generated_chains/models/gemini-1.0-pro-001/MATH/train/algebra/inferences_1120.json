At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of all real numbers that are doubled when added to their reciprocals?",

        "ground_truth": "Let such a real number be $x$. We have the property that $x+\\frac{1}{x}=2x$, or $x=\\frac{1}{x} \\Rightarrow x^2-1=0$. Thus, the product of the (both real) solutions is $-1\\cdot 1=\\boxed{-1}$."
