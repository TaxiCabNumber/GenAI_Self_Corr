        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with the line $y = 5$, and so that the endpoints of this side lie on the parabola $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$. What is the area of the square?",
        "inference": "The line $y = 5$ intersects the parabola $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ at the points $(-1, 5)$ and $(2, 5)$. Thus, the endpoints of the side coinciding with $y = 5$ are $(-1, 5)$ and $(2, 5)$.\n\nThe length of this side is thus $2-(-1) = 3$.\n\nSince the square is drawn such that one of its sides coincides with $y = 5$, the other three sides must be parallel to the $y$-axis.\n\nThus, the length of each of the other three sides is also $3$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is $3 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The points of intersection of the line $y = 5$ and $y = x^2 + 3x + 2$ are found when $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 5$. Thus we have the quadratic  $x^2 + 3x -3=0$. By the quadratic formula,  $$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -3}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{2}$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, which will give a side length of the square. The difference is $2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{2} = \\sqrt{21}$.\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is the square of the side length, which is $(\\sqrt{21})^2 = \\boxed{21}$."
