        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain city the rate of taxation is the following: $x\\%$ tax is collected for an income of $x$ thousand dollars. What income, in dollars, will yield the greatest take home pay? (Take-home pay  is the income minus the tax on that income.)",
        "inference": "Let the income be $x$ thousand dollars. \n\nThen, tax = $\\frac{x}{100}$ * x = $\\frac{x^2}{100}$ thousand dollars. \n\nTherefore, take-home pay = $x$ - $\\frac{x^2}{100}$ = $\\frac{100x - x^2}{100}$ thousand dollars. \n\nTo find the maximum take-home pay, we need to find the maximum of the function f(x) = $\\frac{100x - x^2}{100}$. \n\nThe derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = $\\frac{100 - 2x}{100}$. \n\nSetting f'(x) = 0, we get 100 - 2x = 0, which gives x = 50.\n\nSo, the maximum take-home pay occurs when the income is $50$ thousand dollars.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50000}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The amount of tax collected is $\\frac{x}{100} \\cdot 1000x = 10x^2,$ so the take home pay is\n\\[1000x - 10x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1000x - 10x^2 &= -10(x^2 - 100x) \\\\\n&= -10(x^2 - 100x + 2500) + 25000 \\\\\n&= -10(x - 50)^2 + 25000.\n\\end{align*}The maximum take home pay occurs when $x = 50,$ which corresponds to an income of $\\boxed{50000}$ dollars."
