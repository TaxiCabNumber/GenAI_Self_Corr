        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf Heidi can paint a wall in 45 minutes, what fractional part of the wall can she paint in 9 minutes?",
        "inference": "Heidi paints 1/45 of the wall in 1 minute.\nIn 9 minutes, she paints (9 x 1/45) = 9/45 = 1/5 of the wall.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $9$ minutes is $1/5$ of $45$ minutes, we can find the fractional part of a wall that Heidi can paint in $9$ minutes by dividing the amount of wall that Heidi can paint in $45$ minutes by $5$. Since Heidi can paint a whole wall in $45$ minutes, it follows that she can paint $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$ of a wall in $9$ minutes."
