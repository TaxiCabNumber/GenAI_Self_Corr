At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of cans in the layers of a display in a supermarket form an arithmetic sequence. The bottom layer has 28 cans; the next layer has 25 cans and so on until there is one can at the top of the display. How many cans are in the entire display?",
        "inference": "The number of cans in the bottom layer is 28. \nThe number of cans in the next layer is 25. \nThe number of cans in the third layer is therefore 22. \nThe number of cans in the fourth layer is 19. \nAnd so on. \nThe common difference between the number of cans in each layer is -3. \nThe number of cans in the nth layer is therefore 28 - 3(n - 1). \nThe number of layers in the display is the number of times the common difference can be subtracted from the number of cans in the bottom layer until we reach 1. \nThis is given by the formula: \nNumber of layers = (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1\nLast term = 1\nFirst term = 28\nCommon difference = -3\nNumber of layers = (1 - 28) / -3 + 1 = 10\nThe total number of cans in the display is the sum of the number of cans in each layer. \nThis is given by the formula: \nTotal number of cans = (Number of layers / 2) * (First term + Last term)\nNumber of layers = 10\nFirst term = 28\nLast term = 1\nTotal number of cans = (10 / 2) * (28 + 1) = 145\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$145$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The arithmetic series is $1 + 4 + \\cdots + 25 + 28$, with a common difference of 3. Suppose there are $n$ terms in the series. Then 28 is the $n$th term, so $1 + (n-1)\\cdot 3 = 28$. Solving, we get $n = 10$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(1 + 28)/2 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{145}$."
