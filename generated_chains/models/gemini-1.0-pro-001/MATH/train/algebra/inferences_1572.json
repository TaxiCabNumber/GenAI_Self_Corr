At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(3,5)$ and $B(7,10)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The diameter of the circle is $\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{(7-3)^2+(10-5)^2}=\\sqrt{16+25}=\\sqrt{41}$.\nThe radius of the circle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\overline{AB}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{41}$.\nThe area of the circle is $\\pi \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{41}\\right)^2=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\cdot 41=\\boxed{10.25\\pi}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10.25\\pi}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the radius of the circle in order to find the area. We are told that points $A$ and $B$ are the endpoints of a diameter, so we can find the distance between these two points. We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(7-3)^2 + (10-5)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 25} = \\sqrt{41}$.\n\nSince the diameter has a length of $\\sqrt{41}$, the radius must have length $\\sqrt{41}/2$. Therefore, the answer is $(\\sqrt{41}/2)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{41\\pi}{4}}$."
