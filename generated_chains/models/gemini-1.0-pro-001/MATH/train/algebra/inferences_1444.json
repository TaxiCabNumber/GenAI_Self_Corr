At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all values of $k$ such that the equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ has two distinct integer solutions?",
        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $2x^2-kx+8=0$ is $k^2-32$. For the equation to have two distinct integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Thus, $k^2-32=n^2$ for some integer $n$. Rearranging, we get $k^2-n^2=32$, which factors as $(k+n)(k-n)=32$. Since $k$ and $n$ are integers, the only possible factors of $32$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $16$, and $32$. The only pairs of factors that sum to $k$ are $(2,16)$ and $(8,8)$. Thus, the sum of all values of $k$ is $2+16+8+8=\\boxed{34}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{34}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $-b/a$ and $c/a$, respectively. Let the two roots of the equation be $p$ and $q$. Then $p+q=k/2$. However the only other restriction on $p$ and $q$ is that $pq = 4$ and that $p$ and $q$ are distinct integers. For each such possibility $(p,q)$, we also have the possibility $(-p,-q)$ since $(-p)(-q) = pq = 4$. This gives two values of $k$: $k=2(p+q)$ and $k=2(-p-q)$. Since these occur in such pairs, the sum of all possible values of $k$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can note that the only way to factor 4 into 2 distinct integer factors is $4\\cdot1$ and $(-4)(-1)$, so that the two possible values of $k$ are $10$ and $-10$, given a sum of $0$."
