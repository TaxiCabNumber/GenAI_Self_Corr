At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation of the line that passes through the points $(-3,5)$ and $(0,-4)$ can be expressed in the form $y=mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
        "inference": "First, find the slope of the line using the formula $m = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1) = (-3, 5)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (0, -4)$.\n```\nm = (-4 - 5) / (0 - (-3)) = 9 / 3 = 3\n```\n\nNext, find the y-intercept of the line using the point-slope form of the equation, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$. Substitute the values of $m$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ from the given point $(-3, 5)$.\n```\ny - 5 = 3(x - (-3))\ny - 5 = 3(x + 3)\ny - 5 = 3x + 9\ny = 3x + 14\n```\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y = 3x + 14$, and $m+b = 3 + 14 = \\boxed{17}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since both of these points lie on the line, plugging them into the equation of the line will produce a true statement.  Thus $(-3, 5)$ gives us $5 = -3m + b$ and $(0, -4)$ gives us $-4 = b$.  So we now know what $b$ is and can plug it back into the first equation to get $5 = -3m - 4$.  So $m = -3$ and $m + b = \\boxed{-7}$."
