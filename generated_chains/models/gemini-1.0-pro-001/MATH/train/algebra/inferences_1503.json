At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA television's price was discounted $40\\%$ and then slashed another $40\\%$ during a liquidation sale. By what percent has the original price been reduced?",
        "inference": "The discount of $40\\%$ means that we multiply by $100\\%-40\\%=60\\%=0.6$.\n\nAfter the first discount, the price is $60\\%$ of its original value.\n\nThe second discount of $40\\%$ means that we multiply by $100\\%-40\\%=60\\%=0.6$ again.\n\nTherefore, the final price is $60\\%$ of $60\\%$ of the original price, or $0.6\\times 0.6 = 0.36$.\n\nThe reduction in price is $1-0.36=0.64$.\n\nTherefore, the price has been reduced by $64\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{64}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the original price of the television be $T$. Then the price is now $0.6(0.6T)=0.36T$. Thus overall the price has been reduced by $1-0.36=\\boxed{64\\%}$."
