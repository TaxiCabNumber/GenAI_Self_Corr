I hope it is correct.'\nKaren drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",

Divide the distance traveled by the total travel time to find the average speed:\n165 miles / 3.67 hours = 44.96 miles per hour\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$44.96}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour."
