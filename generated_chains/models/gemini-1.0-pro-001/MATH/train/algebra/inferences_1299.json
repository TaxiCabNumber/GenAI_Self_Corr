At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind $x$ such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x = \\dfrac{13}{3}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, we know that $x-\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is a number between $0$ and $1$ (inclusive).

So, we have\n\n$$x= \\dfrac{13}{3}-4=\\dfrac{13}{3}-\\dfrac{12}{3}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$.
