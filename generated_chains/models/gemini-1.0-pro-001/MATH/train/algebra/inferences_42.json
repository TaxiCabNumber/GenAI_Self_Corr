        "ground_truth": "In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.
