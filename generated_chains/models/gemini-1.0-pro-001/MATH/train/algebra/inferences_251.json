At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions on $\\mathbb{R}$ such that the range of $f$ is $[-5,3]$, and the range of $g$ is $[-2,1]$.  The range of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is $[a,b]$.  What is the largest possible value of $b$?",

From the given information, the minimum values of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are $-5$ and $-2$, respectively.  Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is $-5 \\cdot (-2)=10$.  To find the largest possible value of $b$, we must then find the maximum possible value of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.  The maximum possible value of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ occurs when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ take on their maximum values.  From the given information, the maximum values of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are $3$ and $1$, respectively.  Therefore, the maximum possible value of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is $3 \\cdot 1=3$.  Since the range of $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is $[a,b]$, and we have determined that the largest possible value of $b$ is $3$, we have $b=3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $|f(x)| \\le 5$ for all $x$ and $|g(x)| \\le 2$ for all $x$, $|f(x) g(x)| \\le 10$ for all $x$.  It follows that $f(x) g(x) \\le 10$ for all $x$, so $b$ is at most 10.\n\nFurthermore, if $f$ is any function such that the range of $f$ is $[-5,3]$ and $f(0) = -5$, and $g$ is any function such the range of $g$ is $[-2,1]$ and $g(0) = -2$, then $f(0) g(0) = (-5) \\cdot (-2) = 10$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
