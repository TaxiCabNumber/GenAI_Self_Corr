        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven identical bowling balls weigh the same as three identical canoes. If two of the canoes weigh a total of 56 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nIf 2 canoes weigh 56 pounds, then 3 canoes weigh 56 * 3/2 = 84 pounds.\n\nSince 7 bowling balls weigh the same as 3 canoes, 1 bowling ball weigh 84/7 = 12 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe. We have that $7b=3c$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}$, we have $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 7b=\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 3c \\Rightarrow \\frac{14}{3}b=2c=56$. Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\\boxed{12}$ pounds."
