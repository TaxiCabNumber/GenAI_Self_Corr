At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $x$ for which $(8-x)^2=x^2$?",

        "ground_truth": "Expanding the square on the left, we have $64- 16x + x^2 = x^2$.  The $x^2$ terms cancel and leave $64-16x = 0$, so $x = \\boxed{4}$."
