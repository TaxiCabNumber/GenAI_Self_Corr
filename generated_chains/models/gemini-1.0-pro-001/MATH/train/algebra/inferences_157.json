At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy works for 36 hours per week for 10 weeks during the summer, making $\\$3000$. If she works for 30 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$3000$, how many hours per week must she work?",
        "inference": "If Amy works 36 hours per week for 10 weeks during the summer, she makes $36\\times 10 \\times r = 360r$ dollars, where r is her hourly rate of pay.\n\nIf she needs to make another $3000 during the school year, she will need to work $3000/r$ hours.\n\nIf she works 30 weeks during the school year, she will work $30(3000/r) = 90000/r$ hours.\n\nTherefore, she must work $90000/r - 360r$ hours per week during the school year.\n\nSolving for r, we get $r = 100$.\n\nThus, Amy must work $90000/100 - 360(100) = \\boxed{30}$ hours per week during the school year.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 3 times as many weeks, she can work 3 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
