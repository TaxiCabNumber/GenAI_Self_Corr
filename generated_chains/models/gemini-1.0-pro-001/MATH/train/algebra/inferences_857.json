        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the slope of the line $2y = -3x + 6$?",
        "inference": "The given equation is in the form of $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope. Let's solve the equation for $y$:\n\n$2y = -3x + 6$\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n$y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 3$\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line is $-\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives $y = -\\frac{3}{2}x + 3$, which is in slope-intercept form.  The coefficient of $x$ is the desired slope, $\\boxed{-\\frac32}$."
