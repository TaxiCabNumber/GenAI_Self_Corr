At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGeorge has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+\\frac13$, where $b$ is a specific negative number. Using his knowledge of how to complete the square, George is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+\\frac{1}{12}$. What is $b$?",
