At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Putting the first equation in slope-intercept form gives $y = 3x + a$ which means this line has a slope of 3.  Similarly the second equation gives $y = (a + 6)x - 1,$ meaning it has a slope of $a + 6$.  Since the two lines are parallel they have equal slopes: $3 = a + 6 \\Rightarrow a = \\boxed{-3}$."
