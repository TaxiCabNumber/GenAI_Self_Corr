        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chess team has $26$ members. However, only $16$ members attended the last meeting: half of the girls attended but all of the boys attended. How many girls are on the chess team?",
        "inference": "Let's assume there are $g$ girls on the chess team. Then the number of boys on the chess team is $26 - g$.\n\nHalf of the girls attended the last meeting, so $g/2$ girls attended. All of the boys attended, so $26 - g$ boys attended.\n\nIn total, $16$ members attended the last meeting, so we have the equation:\n\n$$g/2 + (26 - g) = 16$$\n\nSolving for $g$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{g}{2} + 26 - g = 16$$\n\n$$26 - \\frac{g}{2} = 16$$\n\n$$26 - 16 = \\frac{g}{2}$$\n\n$$10 = \\frac{g}{2}$$\n\n$$g = 20$$\n\nTherefore, there are $20$ girls on the chess team.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}G=26-16=10\\implies G=20$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{20}$ girls on the chess team."
