        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let's call the length of the rectangle $l$ and the width $w$. Then the perimeter is given by $2l + 2w = 24$. Solving for $l$, we get $l = 12 - w$. \nNow, the area of the rectangle is given by $A = lw = w(12 - w) = 12w - w^2$. To find the maximum area, we can use the derivative. The derivative of $A$ is given by $A' = 12 - 2w$. \nSetting $A' = 0$, we get $w = 6$. \nSubstituting $w = 6$ back into the equation for $l$, we get $l = 6$. \nTherefore, the maximum area is $A = lw = 6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ square inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let one pair of parallel sides have length $x$ and the other pair of parallel sides have length $12-x$. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is $x+x+12-x+12-x=24$ as the problem states. The area of this rectangle is $12x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-6)^2+36\\le 36$ since $(x-6)^2\\ge 0$, so the maximum area of $\\boxed{36}$ is obtained when the rectangle is a square of side length 6 inches."
