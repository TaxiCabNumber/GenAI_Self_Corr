        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 25 and their product is 126. What is the absolute value of the difference of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two numbers $x$ and $y$. We know that $x+y=25$ and $xy=126$. We can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables, say $x$. Then we can substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation and solve for $y$. Once we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find their absolute difference.\n\nSolving for $x$ from the first equation, we get $x=25-y$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get $(25-y)y=126$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $y^2-25y+126=0$. Factoring, we get $(y-7)(y-18)=0$. Therefore, $y=7$ or $y=18$.\n\nIf $y=7$, then $x=25-y=25-7=18$. If $y=18$, then $x=25-y=25-18=7$.\n\nThe absolute difference between $x$ and $y$ is $|x-y|=|18-7|=11$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are given that $x + y = 25$ and $xy = 126$ for some numbers $x$ and $y$. We note that \\begin{align*}\n(x-y)^2&= x^2 - 2xy + y^2\\\\\n&= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - 4xy\\\\\n&= (x + y)^2 - 4xy\\\\\n&= (25)^2 - 4\\cdot 126\\\\\n&= 121.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, we have $(x - y)^2 = 121$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $\\sqrt{(x- y)^2} = |x - y| = \\boxed{11}$."
