I hope it is correct.'\nSarah is trying to fence a rectangular area containing at least 100 sq. ft while using the least amount of material to build the fence. The length of the rectangular area should be 15 ft longer than the width. What should the width, in ft, be?",
        "inference": "Let the width of the rectangle be x ft.\nThen, the length of the rectangle = (x + 15) ft\nArea of the rectangle = x (x + 15) sq. ft\nGiven that the area should be at least 100 sq. ft\nTherefore, x (x + 15) \u2265 100\n\u21d2 x^2 + 15x \u2265 100\n\u21d2 x^2 + 15x - 100 \u2265 0\n\u21d2 (x + 25)(x - 4) \u2265 0\n\u21d2 x \u2265 4\nSince the width cannot be negative, therefore, x \u2265 4\nNow, to find the minimum amount of material required to build the fence, we need to find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle.\nPerimeter of the rectangle = 2(length + width) = 2(x + x + 15) = 4x + 30\nFor the minimum perimeter, we need to find the minimum value of 4x + 30\nSince x \u2265 4, therefore, minimum value of 4x + 30 occurs when x = 4\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can write the problem as the inequality $w(w+15)\\ge100$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 100 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nw(w+15)&\\ge100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nw^2+15w-100&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(w-5)(w+20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*} The roots are $w=5$ and $w=-20$. We can't have a width of -20 ft, so the smallest width possible while still having an area of at least 100 sq. ft is $\\boxed{5}$ ft."
