At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the product $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$ can be written in the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, where $a,b,c,d$ are real numbers, then find $8a + 4b + 2c + d$.",

Hence, $8a + 4b + 2c + d = 8(-6) + 4(31) + 2(-7) + (-14) = -48 + 124 - 14 - 14 = \\boxed{-2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "One can find this by multiplying the two polynomials and computing the coefficients. Alternatively, we notice that the desired expression is simply the value of $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ evaluated at the point $x=2$: $a(2)^3 + b(2)^2 + c(2) + d = 8a + 4b + 2c + d$. Since $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$ and  $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ are equivalent expressions, they are equal for all real values of $x$.  In particular, they are equal when $x=2$.
