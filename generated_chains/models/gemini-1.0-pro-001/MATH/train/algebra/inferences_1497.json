At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBilly's age is twice Joe's age and the sum of their ages is 45. How old is Billy?",
        "inference": "Let $J$ be Joe's age and $B$ be Billy's age.\n\nThen, we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$B=2J\\tag 1$$\n\n$$B+J=45\\tag 2$$\n\nSubstituting (1) into (2), we get:\n\n$$2J+J=45$$\n\n$$3J=45$$\n\n$$J=15$$\n\nSubstituting $J=15$ into (1), we get:\n\n$$B=2(15)=30$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$30$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $B$ and $J$ represent the respective ages of Billy and Joe. We can write the equations $B=2J$ and $B+J=45$. We use the second equation to solve for $J$ in terms of $B$ and get $J=45-B$. Now we plug in this expression for $J$ into the first equation. $$B=2(45-B)=90-2B\\qquad\\Rightarrow 3B=90\\qquad\\Rightarrow B=30$$ So Billy is $\\boxed{30}$ years old."
