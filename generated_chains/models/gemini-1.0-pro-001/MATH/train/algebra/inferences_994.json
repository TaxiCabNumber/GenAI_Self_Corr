At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnthony made $5$ of his first $12$ free throw attempts. If he makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, by how many percentage points will he increase his overall success rate percentage? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
        "inference": "Initially, Anthony made 5 free throws out of 12 attempts, so his success rate was 5/12 = 0.4167.\n\nIf he makes 2/3 of his next 24 attempts, he will make 2/3 * 24 = 16 free throws.\n\nHis total number of attempts will be 12 + 24 = 36.\n\nHis total number of successful free throws will be 5 + 16 = 21.\n\nTherefore, his overall success rate will be 21/36 = 0.5833, which is 0.5833 - 0.4167 = 0.1666 or 16.66% higher than his initial success rate.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If Anthony makes $2/3$ of his next $24$ attempts, he will make another $16$ free throws. Then he will have $5 + 16 = 21$ successful throws in $12 + 24 = 36$ attempts. That's a success rate of $21/36 = 7/12$, which is $58.3\\%$. His success rate before was $5/12$, which is $41.6\\%$. The increase is $58.3 - 41.6 = 16.7$, or $\\boxed{17\\%}$ to the nearest whole number."
