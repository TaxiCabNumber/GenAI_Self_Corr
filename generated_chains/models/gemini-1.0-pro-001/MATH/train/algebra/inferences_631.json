At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The only integer value of $M$ that satisfies this inequality is $M = 13$. Therefore, the average of all the integer values of $M$ that satisfy the given inequality is $13$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.**",
