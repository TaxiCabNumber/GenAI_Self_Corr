        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some oxygen in a 2.28 liter container with a pressure of 5 kPa. If I move all of it to a 5.7 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume, so:\n\n```\nP\u2081V\u2081 = P\u2082V\u2082\n```\n\nwhere P\u2081 is the initial pressure, V\u2081 is the initial volume, P\u2082 is the final pressure, and V\u2082 is the final volume.\n\nWe are given that P\u2081 = 5 kPa, V\u2081 = 2.28 L, and V\u2082 = 5.7 L. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n```\n5 kPa * 2.28 L = P\u2082 * 5.7 L\n```\n\nSolving for P\u2082, we get:\n\n```\nP\u2082 = (5 kPa * 2.28 L) / 5.7 L\n```\n\n```\nP\u2082 = 2 kPa\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the pressure $p$ of the oxygen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=2.28\\cdot5=11.4$. Consequently, when we move it to the 5.7 liter container, we get that $5.7p=11.4$, so $p=\\boxed{2}$."
