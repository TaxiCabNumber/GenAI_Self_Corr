        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chess team has $26$ members. However, only $16$ members attended the last meeting: half of the girls attended but all of the boys attended. How many boys are on the chess team?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of girls on the chess team. Then $26-x$ is the number of boys on the chess team.\nSince half of the girls attended the last meeting, $\\frac{x}{2}$ girls attended the last meeting.\nSince all of the boys attended the last meeting, $26-x$ boys attended the last meeting.\nTherefore, the total number of members who attended the last meeting is $\\frac{x}{2} + (26-x) = 16$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 20$.\nTherefore, the number of boys on the chess team is $26-20 = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let there be $B$ boys and $G$ girls. Since every member is either a boy or a girl, $B+G=26$. Also, we have $\\frac{1}{2}G+B=16$. Multiplying the second equation by $2$, we get $G+2B=32$. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $B=32-26=6$.\n\nThus there are $\\boxed{6}$ boys on the chess team."
