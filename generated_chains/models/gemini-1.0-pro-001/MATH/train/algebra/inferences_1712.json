        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAndrew's grandfather's age is twelve times Andrew's age. If Andrew's grandfather was 55 years old when Andrew was born, how many years old is Andrew now?",
        "inference": "Step 1: Let Andrew's current age be x.\nStep 2: Andrew's grandfather's age is 12x.\nStep 3: 12x - x = 55 (since the grandfather was 55 years older when Andrew was born)\nStep 4: 11x = 55\nStep 5: x = 5\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be Andrew's age now and $g$ be his grandfather's age now. We are looking for the value of $a$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng &= 12a \\\\\ng-a &= 55 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn particular, the second equation represents the grandfather's age $a$ years ago, when Andrew was born. To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $g$ from the equations above. Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $g$, we get that $12a-a=55$ or $a=5$. Thus, Andrew is $\\boxed{5}$ years old now."
