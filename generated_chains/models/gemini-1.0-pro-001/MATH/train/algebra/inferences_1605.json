At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?",
        "inference": "**1.** Let $a$ be the number of ants of Species A and $b$ be the number of ants of Species B on Day 0.\n\n**2.** Then, on Day 5, the number of ants of Species A is $a \\cdot 2^5$ and the number of ants of Species B is $b \\cdot 3^5$.\n\n**3.** Since there are 30 ants in his ant farm on Day 0, we have $a+b=30$.\n\n**4.** Since there are 3281 ants in his ant farm on Day 5, we have $a\\cdot 2^5 + b\\cdot 3^5 = 3281$.\n\n**5.** Solving the system of equations, we get $a=16$ and $b=14$.\n\n**6.** Therefore, there are 16 ants of Species A on Day 5.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$16$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that there are $a$ ants of Species A and $b$ ants of Species B on Day 0. We thus have that $a+b=30$. Notice that on Day 1, there will be $2a$ ants of Species A, on Day 2, there will be $2(2a) = 4a$ ants of Species A, and on Day 3, there will be $2(4a)=8a$ ants of Species A, etc. Following this line of reasoning, on Day 5, there will be $2^5a$ ants of Species A and $3^5b$ ants of Species B, meaning that $32a+243b=3281$. We now solve this system of linear equations. We have that $32a+32b=960$, so \\begin{align*}(32a+243b)-(32a+32b) &= 211b \\\\\n&= 3281-960 \\\\\n&= 2321.\\end{align*}We then have $b = \\frac{2321}{211} = 11$. This means that $a=30-11=19$, and there are $32\\cdot 19 = \\boxed{608}$ ants of Species A on Day 5."
