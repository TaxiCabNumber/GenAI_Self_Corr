At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn Tuesday, I worked $t+1$ hours and earned $3t-3$ dollars per hour. My friend Andrew worked $3t-5$ hours but only earned $t+2$ dollars an hour. At the end of the day, I had earned two dollars more than he had. What is the value of $t$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let's calculate how much I earned.\nWe know that I worked $t+1$ hours and earned $3t-3$ dollars per hour. So, I earned $(t+1) \\times (3t - 3)$ dollars.\n\n**Step 2**: Let's calculate how much Andrew earned.\nWe know that Andrew worked $3t-5$ hours and earned $t+2$ dollars per hour. So, Andrew earned $(3t - 5) \\times (t + 2)$ dollars.\n\n**Step 3**: We know that I earned two dollars more than Andrew. So, we can write the equation:\n$(t+1) \\times (3t - 3) = (3t - 5) \\times (t + 2) + 2$\n\n**Step 4**: Let's solve this equation:\n$3t^2 + 3t - 3t - 3 = 3t^2 + 6t - 5t - 10 + 2$\n$3t^2 + 6t - 5t - 10 + 2 = 3t^2 + 3t - 3$\n$t - 8 = 0$\n$t = 8$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$t=8$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since I earned two dollars more than Andrew, we know that $$(t+1) (3t-3) = (3t-5)(t+2) + 2 \\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad 3t^2-3 = 3t^2 + t -8 .$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{5}$."
