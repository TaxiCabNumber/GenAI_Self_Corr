        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "After his first hop, he has $\\frac{2}{3}$ the distance to travel.\nAfter his second hop, he has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $\\frac{2}{3}$ which is $\\frac{4}{9}$ the distance to travel.\nAfter his third hop, he has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $\\frac{4}{9}$ which is $\\frac{8}{27}$ the distance to travel.\nAfter his fourth hop, he has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $\\frac{8}{27}$ which is $\\frac{16}{81}$ the distance to travel.\nAfter his fifth hop, he has $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $\\frac{16}{81}$ which is $\\frac{32}{243}$ the distance to travel.\nAdding the distances he has hopped after each of five hops, we have\n$$0+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2}{9}+\\frac{4}{27}+\\frac{8}{81}+\\frac{16}{243}=\\frac{32}{243}+\\frac{16}{243}+\\frac{8}{81}+\\frac{4}{27}+\\frac{2}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{82}{243}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{82}{243}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Kevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop. His first hop takes $1/3$ closer. For his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$. For his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$. In general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop. We want to find how far he has hopped after five hops. This is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms. Thus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$."
