        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDr. Fu Manchu has a bank account that has an annual interest rate of 6 percent, but it compounds monthly.  If this is equivalent to a bank account that compounds annually at a rate of $r$ percent, then what is $r$?  (Give your answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
        "inference": "Let the amount of money in the account be $P$.\nThen, the amount of money in the account after one year with monthly compounding is:\n\n\n$$P\\times (1 + 6/100/12)^{12}$$\n\n$$P\\times (1.005)^{12}$$\n\nThe amount of money in the account after one year with annual compounding at a rate of r percent is:\n\n\n$$P\\times (1 + r/100)$$\n\nSince these two amounts are equivalent, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\n$$P\\times (1.005)^{12}=P\\times (1 + r/100)$$\n\nDividing both sides by P, we get:\n\n\n$$(1.005)^{12}=1 + r/100$$\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\n\n$$r = 100\\times ((1.005)^{12}-1)$$\n\n$$r = 100\\times (1.06168-1)$$\n\n$$r = 100\\times 0.06168$$\n\n$$r = 6.17$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The bank account compounds monthly at an interest rate of $6/12 = 0.5$ percent.  Therefore, in the course of a year, the bank account compounds annually at a rate of $1.005^{12} = 1.061678 \\dots$.  To the nearest hundredth, the interest rate is $\\boxed{6.17}$ percent."
