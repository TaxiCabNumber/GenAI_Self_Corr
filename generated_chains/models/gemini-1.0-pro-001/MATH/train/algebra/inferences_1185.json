At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "First, we can expand the left side of the equation to get:\n\n$$2b^2+3b-5b-5=6b$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n$$2b^2-2b-5=6b$$\n\nSubtracting 6b from both sides, we get:\n\n$$2b^2-8b-5=0$$\n\nFactoring, we get:\n\n$$(2b+1)(b-5)=0$$\n\nSo either $2b+1=0$ or $b-5=0$. Solving each equation, we get $b=-1/2$ or $b=5$. The largest possible value of $b$ is $5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We proceed as follows: \\begin{align*}\n(2b + 5)(b - 1) &= 6b\\\\\n2b^2 + 3b - 5 &= 6b\\\\\n2b^2 - 3b - 5 &= 0\\\\\n(2b - 5)(b + 1) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}This gives us $b = \\frac{5}{2}$ or $b = -1.$ Of these, $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$ is the larger possible value of $b.$"
