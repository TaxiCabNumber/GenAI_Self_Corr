At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarcelle and Jaclyn each think of a polynomial.  Each of their polynomials is monic, has degree 4, and has the same positive constant term and the same coefficient of $z$. The product of their polynomials is \\[z^8 +3z^7 +z^6 +3z^5 +4z^4 +6z^3 +2z^2 +4.\\]What  is the constant term of Jaclyn's polynomial?",
        "inference": "The constant term of the product is the product of the constant terms of the two polynomials.  Since the constant term of one polynomial is the same as the constant term of the other, and both polynomials are monic, the constant term of each polynomial is $1$.  Therefore, the constant term of Jaclyn's polynomial is $\\boxed{1}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the constant terms of both polynomials in the product are positive, are the same, and multiply to 4, they must each equal $\\sqrt{4} = \\boxed{2}$."
