At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour years ago you invested some money at $10\\%$ interest. You now have $\\$439.23$ in the account. If the interest was compounded yearly, how much did you invest 4 years ago?",
        "inference": "Let $P$ be the amount invested 4 years ago.\nThen, the amount after 4 years is $P(1 + 0.1)^4$.\nSo, we have:\n$$P(1 + 0.1)^4 = 439.23$$\nDividing both sides by $(1 + 0.1)^4$, we get\n$$P = \\frac{439.23}{(1 + 0.1)^4}$$\nSimplifying, we get\n$$P = \\frac{439.23}{1.4641}$$\n$$P \\approx 300$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$300$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the initial amount.  After four years, at a ten percent annual interest rate, the investment will have grown to $x \\cdot 1.1^4$, so $x \\cdot 1.1^4 = 439.23$.  Then $x = 439.23/1.1^4 = \\boxed{300}$."
