At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA grocer makes a display of cans in which the top row has one can and each lower row has two more cans than the row above it. If the display contains 100 cans, how many rows does it contain?",
        "inference": "Let n be the number of rows in the display. Then the number of cans in the top row is 1, the number of cans in the second row is 3, the number of cans in the third row is 5, and so on. The number of cans in the nth row is 2n-1. The total number of cans in the display is the sum of the number of cans in each row. We can write this as:\n\n$$1+3+5+\\cdots+(2n-1)=100$$\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term 1, common difference 2, and n terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n$$\\frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$$\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term, $a_n$ is the nth term, and n is the number of terms. Plugging in the values we know, we get:\n$$\\frac{n(1+2n-1)}{2}=100$$\nSimplifying:\n$$\\frac{n(2n)}{2}=100$$\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n$$n^2=100$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$n=10$$\nTherefore, the display contains 10 rows.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of cans in each row form an arithmetic sequence, with first term 1 and common difference 2.  If there are $n$ terms, then the terms are 1, 3, $\\dots$, $2n - 1$.\n\nThe total number of cans is therefore the sum of the arithmetic series \\[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2n - 1).\\]The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $[1 + (2n - 1)]/2 \\cdot n = n^2$.\n\nThen from $n^2 = 100$, we get $n = \\boxed{10}$."
