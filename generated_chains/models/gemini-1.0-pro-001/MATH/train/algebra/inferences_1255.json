        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nElmo makes $N$ sandwiches for a fundraiser. For each sandwich he uses $B$ globs of peanut butter at $4$ cents per glob and $J$ blobs of jam at $5$ cents per blob.  The cost of the peanut butter and jam to make all the sandwiches is $\\$2.53$. Assume that  $B$, $J$, and $N$ are positive integers with $N>1$. What is the cost, in dollars, of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches?",
        "inference": "The cost of the peanut butter is $4B$ cents per sandwich, and the cost of the jam is $5J$ cents per sandwich.  Since Elmo makes $N$ sandwiches, the total cost of the peanut butter is $4BN$ cents, and the total cost of the jam is $5JN$ cents.  The total cost of the peanut butter and jam is $4BN + 5JN$ cents, which is $\\$2.53$.  Therefore, we have the equation\n\n$$4BN + 5JN = 25300$$\n\nSince $B$, $J$, and $N$ are positive integers, the only solutions to this equation are $B = 11$, $J = 3$, and $N = 10$.  Therefore, the cost of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches is $5JN = 5(3)(10) = \\boxed{150}$ cents, or $\\$1.50$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$1.50$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The total cost of the peanut butter and jam is $N(4B+5J) = 253$ cents, so $N$ and $4B + 5J$ are factors of $253 =\n11\\cdot23$. Because $N>1$, the possible values of $N$ are 11, 23, and 253. If $N=253$, then $4B+5J = 1$, which is impossible since $B$ and $J$ are positive integers. If $N=23$, then $4B + 5J = 11$, which also has no solutions in positive integers. Hence $N = 11$ and $4B+5J=23$, which has the unique positive integer solution $B=2$ and $J=3$. So the cost of the jam is $11(3)(5\\text{ cents})=\\boxed{\\$1.65}$."
