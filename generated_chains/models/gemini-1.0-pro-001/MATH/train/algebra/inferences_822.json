At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKimberly borrows $1000$ dollars from Lucy, who charged interest of $5\\%$ per month (which compounds monthly). What is the least integer number of months after which Kimberly will owe more than twice as much as she borrowed?",
        "inference": "The amount Kimberly owes after $n$ months is $1000\\cdot(1.05)^n$ dollars.  We want to find the least integer $n$ such that $1000\\cdot(1.05)^n>2000$.  Dividing both sides by $1000$, we get $(1.05)^n>2$, so $n>\\log_{1.05}2$.  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{1.05}2\\approx8.403$.  Since $n$ must be an integer, the least integer $n$ such that $(1.05)^n>2$ is $n=\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the amount Kimberly owes is multiplied by 1.05 each month, we want the least integer $t$ for which $1.05^t>2$. Trying some integer values of $t$, we find that $\\boxed{15}$ is the smallest that satisfies this condition."
