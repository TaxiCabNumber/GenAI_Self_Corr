        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlec must purchase 14 identical shirts and only has $\\$130$. There is a flat $\\$2$ entrance fee for shopping at the warehouse store where he plans to buy the shirts.  The price of each shirt is the same whole-dollar amount.  Assuming a $5\\%$ sales tax is added  to the price of each shirt, what is the greatest possible price (in dollars) of a  shirt that would allow Alec to buy the shirts?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the price of each shirt (in dollars).\n\nThe total cost of the shirts before tax is $14x$.\n\nThe sales tax is $5\\%$ of the total cost of the shirts before tax, which is $0.05(14x) = 0.7x$.\n\nThe total cost of the shirts including tax is $14x + 0.7x = 14.7x$.\n\nThe total cost of the shirts including the entrance fee is $14.7x + 2$.\n\nSince Alec has only $130, we have $14.7x + 2 \\le 130$.\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $x \\le \\frac{130 - 2}{14.7} = 8.8435$.\n\nSince $x$ must be a whole dollar amount, the greatest possible price of a shirt is the greatest integer less than or equal to $8.8435$, which is $8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The price of all the shirts without sales tax and the entrance fee must be at most $(130-2)/1.05=121.91$ dollars. Since Alec must buy 14 shirts, and since $121.91/14\\approx8.71$, the most each shirt can cost is $\\boxed{8}$ dollars."
