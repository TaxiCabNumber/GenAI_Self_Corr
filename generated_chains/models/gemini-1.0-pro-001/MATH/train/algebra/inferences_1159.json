At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 3rd and 5th terms of an arithmetic sequence are 17 and 39, respectively. What is the 7th term of the same sequence?",
        "inference": "Let's call the first term \"a\" and the common difference \"d\".\n\nWe are given the 3rd term, which is a + 2d = 17\n\nand the 5th term, which is a + 4d = 39.\n\nSubtracting the 3rd term from the 5th term, we get 2d = 22. Therefore, d = 11.\n\nSubstituting this value of d back into the equation for the 3rd term, we get a + 2d = 17.\n\nTherefore, a = 17 - 2d = 17 - 2(11) = 17 - 22 = -5.\n\nNow we can find the 7th term:\n\na + 6d = -5 + 6(11) = -5 + 66 = 61.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{61}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the third term is $a + 2d = 17$, and the fifth term is $a + 4d = 39$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $2d = 22$.\n\nThen the seventh term is $a + 6d = (a + 4d) + 2d = 39 + 22 = \\boxed{61}$."
