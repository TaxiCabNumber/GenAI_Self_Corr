        "inference": "The $n$th term of a geometric sequence with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is $ar^{n-1}$.\n\nWe are given that the first term is $\\frac{3}{4}$ and the second term is $15$. So, we have\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4}r=15\\Rightarrow r=20.$$\n\nWe want to find the smallest $n$ for which $ar^{n-1}$ is divisible by one million. This is equivalent to finding the smallest $n$ for which $20^{n-1}$ is divisible by one million.\n\nWe can write one million as $10^6$. So, we want to find the smallest $n$ for which $20^{n-1}$ is divisible by $10^6$.\n\nWe can factor $10^6$ as $2^6\\cdot5^6$. So, we want to find the smallest $n$ for which $20^{n-1}$ is divisible by both $2^6$ and $5^6$.\n\nSince $20$ is divisible by $4$, $20^{n-1}$ is divisible by $2^6$ for all $n$. So, we only need to find the smallest $n$ for which $20^{n-1}$ is divisible by $5^6$.\n\nWe can write $20$ as $4\\cdot5$. So, $20^{n-1}=(4\\cdot5)^{n-1}=4^{n-1}\\cdot5^{n-1}$.\n\nWe want $5^{n-1}$ to be divisible by $5^6$. This is equivalent to wanting $n-1\\ge6$, or $n\\ge7$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest $n$ for which the $n$th term of the sequence is divisible by one million is $7$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The common ratio is $$\\frac{15}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 20$$Therefore, the $n$th term is $(20^{n-1}) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\n\n\nIf one million (aka $10^6$) divides the $n$th term, then it must be divisible by $5^6$. This can only happen if $n-1$ is at least $6$, or $n \\ge 7$.\n\n\nThe $7$th term is $$\\left(20^6\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\left(4\\right)^6\\left(5\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = (2)^{10}(5)^6(3),$$which is divisible by $(2)^6(5)^6=10^6$, so the answer is indeed $\\boxed{7}$."
