At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has a first term of $12$ and a second term of $4.$ A second infinite geometric series has the same first term of $12,$ a second term of $4+n,$ and a sum of four times that of the first series. Find the value of $n.$",
        "inference": "Let $r$ be the common ratio of the first series and $s$ be the common ratio of the second series. We have\n\n$$12+4r+4r^2+4r^3+\\cdots=12\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-r}=12$$\n\nSolving for $r$ gives $r=1/2$. So the sum of the first series is $12/(1-1/2)=24$. The sum of the second series is $4\\cdot24=96$. We have\n\n$$12+(4+n)s+(4+n)s^2+(4+n)s^3+\\cdots=12\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-s}=96$$\n\nSolving for $s$ gives $s=3/4$. So the second term of the second series is $4+n=4+(4/3)=16/3$.\n\n$$\\boxed{16/3}.$$",
