        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the equation $\\frac{1}{j} + \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{3}$, both $j$ and $k$ are positive integers. What is the sum of all possible values for $k$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe multiply both sides by $3jk$ to get $3j+3k=jk$. Since $j$ and $k$ are integers, $jk$ has to be a multiple of 3. The only possible values for $jk$ are $3,6,9,12,15,18,\\ldots$\n\nThe equation $3j+3k=jk$ can be rewritten as $jk-3j-3k+9=0$, or $(j-3)(k-3)=9$. The only two positive factors of 9 are 3 and 3, so the only two possible solutions are $j-3=3$ and $k-3=3$. This gives us two solutions: $j=6$ and $k=6$, or $j=3$ and $k=3$.\n\nIf $j=6$ and $k=6$, then the sum of all possible values for $k$ is $6$.\n\nIf $j=3$ and $k=3$, then the sum of all possible values for $k$ is $3$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides of the equation by $3jk$ to clear the denominator gives $3k + 3j = jk$. Re-arranging and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$jk - 3j - 3k + 9 = (j-3)(k-3) = 9.$$ Thus, $j-3$ and $k-3$ are pairs of positive factors of $9$, so $(j-3,k-3) = (1,9),(3,3),(9,1)$. These give $k = 4,6,12$, and their sum is $4 + 6 + 12 = \\boxed{22}$."
