At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf eight apples cost the same as four bananas, and two bananas cost the same as three cucumbers, how many cucumbers can Tyler buy for the price of 16 apples?",
        "inference": "1) 8 apples = 4 bananas\n2) 2 bananas = 3 cucumbers\n\nMultiply 1) by 2 and 2) by 4 so that the number of bananas is the same on both sides of the equal sign:\n\n16 apples = 8 bananas\n8 bananas = 12 cucumbers\n\nFor every 16 apples, Tyler can buy 12 cucumbers.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 8 apples cost the same as four bananas, we see that 16 apples cost the same as 8 bananas.  Similarly, 2 bananas cost the same as 3 cucumbers, so 8 bananas cost the same as 12 cucumbers.  Hence, 16 apples have the same price as $\\boxed{12}$ cucumbers."
