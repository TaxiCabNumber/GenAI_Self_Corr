At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n3x^2 + 2&\\text{if } x\\le 3, \\\\\nax - 1 &\\text{if } x>3.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]Find $a$ if the graph of $y=f(x)$ is continuous (which means the graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the graph is continuous, the two pieces of the function must match at $x=3$. Therefore, \n\n$$3(3)^2+2=a(3)-1\\Rightarrow 31=3a-1\\Rightarrow\\boxed{a=11}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{a=11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the graph of $f$ is continuous, then the graphs of the two cases must meet when $x=3$, which (loosely speaking) is the dividing point between the two cases.  Therefore, we must have $3(3^2) + 2 = 3a - 1$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{10}$."
