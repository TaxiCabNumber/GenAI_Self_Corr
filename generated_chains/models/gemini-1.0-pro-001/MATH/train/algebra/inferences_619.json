At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA gasoline tank is $\\frac78$ full. After $12$ gallons have been used, it is half full. How many gallons does this tank hold when it is full?",
        "inference": "If the tank is $\\frac78$ full, then the remaining fraction of the tank is $(1 - \\frac78) = \\frac18$. This means that $12$ gallons is $\\frac18$ of the tank, so the full tank holds $12 \\div \\frac18 = 12 \\times 8 = \\boxed{96}$ gallons.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{96}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ represent the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full. We know that the difference between $\\frac78$ full and $\\frac12$ full is 12 gallons, so we set up an equation and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n12&=\\frac78x-\\frac12x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12&=\\frac38x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12\\cdot\\frac83&=x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n32&=x\n\\end{align*} The tank holds $\\boxed{32}$ gallons when it is full."
