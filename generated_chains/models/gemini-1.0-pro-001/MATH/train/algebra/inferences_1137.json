        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy friend and I both have the same math homework one day. I work at a rate of $p$ problems per hour and it takes me $t$ hours to finish my homework. My friend works at a rate of $2p-4$ problems per hour and it only takes him $t-2$ hours to finish his homework. Given that $p$ and $t$ are positive whole numbers and I do more than $10$ problems per hour, how many problems did I do?",
        "inference": "Let the number of problems be $x$.\n\nI work at a rate of $p$ problems per hour, so it takes me $x/p$ hours to finish my homework.\n\nMy friend works at a rate of $2p-4$ problems per hour, so it takes him $x/(2p-4)$ hours to finish his homework.\n\nIt is given that it takes me $t$ hours to finish my homework, so $x/p = t$.\n\nIt is also given that it takes my friend $t-2$ hours to finish his homework, so $x/(2p-4) = t-2$.\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get $x = pt$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get $pt/(2p-4) = t-2$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $2p-4$, we get $pt = (2p-4)(t-2)$.\n\nExpanding the right side, we get $pt = 2pt-8t-4p+8$.\n\nSubtracting $2pt$ from both sides, we get $-pt = -8t-4p+8$.\n\nDividing both sides by $-p$, we get $t = 8+4/p$.\n\nIt is given that $p$ and $t$ are positive whole numbers and that I do more than $10$ problems per hour, so $p > 10$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for $t$, we get $t > 8+4/10 = 10.4$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $t$ is $11$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation $x = pt$, we get $x = 11p$.\n\nIt is given that I do more than $10$ problems per hour, so $p > 10$.\n\nTherefore, $x > 10 \\cdot 11 = 110$.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $x$ that satisfies all of the given conditions is $\\boxed{111}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{111}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From the information given, we can set up the following equation: $pt = (2p-4)(t-2)$. Simplifying this, we get $pt - 4p - 4t = -8$. Now, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $16$ to both sides to get $pt - 4p - 4t + 16 = 8$. This factors to $$(p-4)(t-4)=8$$Since $p>10$, the only possible combination of $p$ and $t$ is $p=12$ and $t=5$. Thus, I did a total of $12 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{60}$ problems."
