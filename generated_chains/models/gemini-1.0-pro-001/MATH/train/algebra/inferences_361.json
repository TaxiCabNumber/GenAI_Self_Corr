At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $a$ is parallel to line $y=2x+4$ and passes through the point $(2,5)$. What is the y-intercept of line $a$?",
        "inference": "Since line $a$ is parallel to the line $y = 2x + 4$, it has the same slope, which is $2$.\n\nThe equation of the line $a$ is in the form $y = 2x + b$, where $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nSubstituting the point $(2,5)$ into the equation of the line, we get:\n\n```\n5 = 2(2) + b\n5 = 4 + b\nb = 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the y-intercept of line $a$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line $a$ is $2$. Using the point-slope formula, we get that the equation for line $a$ is $y-5=2(x-2)=2x-4$. In slope-intercept form, the equation is $y=2x+1$. Therefore, the y-intercept is $\\boxed{1}$."
