        "ground_truth": "$\\emph{Solution 1: Find the equation of the line.}$\n\nA point-slope equation of the line is $y-0= -2(x-5),$ so the standard form of the equation of the line is $2x+y=10.$ When $x=0,$ we have $y=10,$ so the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,10)}.$\n\n$\\emph{Solution 2: Use the slope without finding the equation.}$\n\nBecause the slope of the line is $-2,$ the line goes down $2$ steps for each $1$ step right.
