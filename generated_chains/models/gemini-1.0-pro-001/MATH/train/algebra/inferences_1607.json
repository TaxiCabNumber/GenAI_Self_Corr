At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $y = -x^2 + 5$ and $x$ is a real number, then what is the maximum value possible for $y$?",

So, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $0$.\n\nThe $y$-coordinate of the vertex is the value of the function at the $x$-coordinate of the vertex. So, the maximum value of $y$ is $y(0) = -0^2 + 5 = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the greatest possible value of $-x^2$ is 0, which is achieved when $x=0$.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y = -x^2 + 5$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is achieved when $x=0$."
