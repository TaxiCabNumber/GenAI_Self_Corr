        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A$ and $B$ have the same $y$-coordinate of 13, but different $x$-coordinates. What is the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept of the line containing both points?",
        "inference": "The slope of the line containing $A$ and $B$ is $0$, since both points have the same $y$-coordinate. The $y$-intercept of the line is $13$, since the line passes through the point $(0, 13)$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $0 + 13 = \\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The slope of a line is $\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. In this case, there is no vertical difference between points $A$ and $B$, so the line is simply a horizontal line with a slope of 0. Since the line is a horizontal line, its $y$-intercept equals the $y$-coordinate of all the other points on the line, 13. So, the sum of the slope and the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{13}$."
