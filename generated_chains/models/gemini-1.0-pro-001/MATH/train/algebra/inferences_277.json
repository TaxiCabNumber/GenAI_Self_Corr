At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven 40 feet of fencing, what is the greatest possible number of square feet in the area of a rectangular pen enclosed by the fencing?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the length and \\(y\\) be the width of the rectangular pen. Then, the perimeter of the pen is given by \n$$2x+2y=40$$\n\nSolving for \\(y\\), we get\n$$y=20-x$$\n\nThe area of the pen is given by\n$$A=xy=x(20-x)=20x-x^2$$\n\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to 0: \n$$\\frac{dA}{dx}=20-2x=0$$\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get\n$$x=10$$\n\nSubstituting this value of \\(x\\) into the equation for the area, we get\n$$A=20(10)-(10)^2=200-100=\\boxed{100}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$100$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 40, the sides of the rectangle add up to $40/2 = 20.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $20 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(20 - x) = 20x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 20x = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100 = 100 - (x - 10)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{100}$ square feet, which occurs for a $10 \\times 10$ square."
