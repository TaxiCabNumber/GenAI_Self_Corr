        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the sum of the second and fourth terms of an arithmetic sequence is $6$, what is the third term?",
        "inference": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$. Then the second term is $a+d$ and the fourth term is $a+3d$.\n\nWe are given that the sum of the second and fourth terms is 6, so we have\n\n$$(a+d)+(a+3d)=6.$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get\n\n$$2a+4d=6.$$\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get\n\n$$a+2d=3.$$\n\nNow we can find the third term, which is $a+2d$, by substituting $a$ in terms of $d$ into this equation. We get\n\n$$a+2d=3$$\n\n$$(3-2d)+2d=3$$\n\n$$3=3$$\n\nTherefore, the third term is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the second term $a$, and the difference between any two consecutive terms $x$. So, the third term is $a+x$, and the fourth term is $a+2x$. Adding the second and fourth terms gives $2a+2x$, which is simply twice the third term. So the third term is $\\frac{6}{2} = \\boxed{3}$."
