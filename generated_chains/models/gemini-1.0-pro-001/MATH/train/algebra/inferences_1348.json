At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarina solved the quadratic equation $9x^2-18x-720=0$ by completing the square. In the process, she came up with the equivalent equation $$(x+r)^2 = s,$$where $r$ and $s$ are constants.\n\nWhat is $s$?",
