At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the product of all $x$ such that the expression $\\frac{x^2+2x+1}{x^2+2x-3}$ is undefined.",
        "inference": "The expression is undefined when the denominator is zero, so we solve the equation $x^2+2x-3=0$.\n\nWe can factor the equation as $(x+3)(x-1)=0$, so the solutions are $x=-3$ and $x=1$.\n\nThe product of these two numbers is $x=-3 \\times x=1=\\boxed{-3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression is only undefined when the denominator is equal to zero. Therefore, the goal is to find the product of all real $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2+2x-3=0$. Since the discriminant of this quadratic is $2^2 - 4(1)(-3) = 16$, which is positive, we know that the roots of $x^2 +2x-3$ are distinct real numbers.  The product of the roots of a quadratic of the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is equal to $\\frac{c}{a}$, so the desired product of the values of $x$ for which $x^2 + 2x - 3=0$ is $\\frac{-3}{1}$, or $\\boxed{-3}$."
