        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f$, $g$, and $h$ be polynomials such that $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$.  If the constant term of $f(x)$ is $-4$ and the constant term of $h(x)$ is 3, what is $g(0)$?",
        "inference": "Since the constant term of $f(x)$ is $-4$, we have $f(0) = -4$.  Since $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$, we have $h(0) = f(0)\\cdot g(0) = -4\\cdot g(0)$.  Since the constant term of $h(x)$ is 3, we have $h(0) = 3$.  Therefore, $-4\\cdot g(0) = 3$, so $g(0) = -3/4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because $h(x) = f(x)\\cdot g(x)$, the constant term of $h$ equals the product of the constant terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.  We are told that the constant terms of $h(x)$ and $f(x)$ are 3 and $-4$, respectively.  Let the constant term of $g(x)$ be $c$.  When we evaluate $g(0)$, all terms with $x$ in them equal 0, so we are left with the constant term, $c$. Therefore, $g(0) = c$.  So, we must have $3 = (-4)\\cdot c$, from which we find $c=\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{4}}$."
