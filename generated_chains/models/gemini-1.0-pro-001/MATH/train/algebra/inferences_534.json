        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $M(2,5)$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $A(3,1)$ is one endpoint, what is the product of the coordinates of point $B$?",
        "inference": "Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, then the coordinates of $B$ are $(2x_B-2, 2y_B-5)$. Since $A$ and $B$ have the same $x$-coordinate, then $2x_B-2=3$, which gives $x_B=2.5$. So, the product of the coordinates of point $B$ is $x_By_B=(2.5)(2y_B-5)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\\\boxed{5y_B-12.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the coordinates of point $B$ $(x,y)$. Because the coordinates of a midpoint of a line segment are the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints, we have that $\\frac{3+x}{2} = 2$ and $\\frac{1+y}{2} = 5$. Solving for $x$ and $y$ yields $x = 1$ and $y = 9$. Thus, point $B$ has coordinates $(1,9)$, so the product of its coordinates is $\\boxed{9}$."
