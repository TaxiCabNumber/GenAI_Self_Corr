At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball is dropped from 10 feet high and always bounces back up half the distance it just fell. After how many bounces will the ball first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot?",
        "inference": "The ball will bounce back up half the distance it fell, so its height after the first bounce is 5 feet. After the second bounce, its height is 2.5 feet. After the third bounce, its height is 1.25 feet. After the fourth bounce, its height is 0.625 feet. After the fifth bounce, its height is 0.3125 feet. After the sixth bounce, its height is 0.15625 feet. Therefore, the ball will first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot after the fifth bounce.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have a geometric sequence with first term 10 and common ratio $1/2$. Any term in this sequence can be represented as $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k=5$, or the height of the $k=1^\\text{st}$ bounce). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k<1$. Through trial and error, we find that $k=4$, so it takes $\\boxed{4}$ bounces for the maximum height to be less than 1 foot."
