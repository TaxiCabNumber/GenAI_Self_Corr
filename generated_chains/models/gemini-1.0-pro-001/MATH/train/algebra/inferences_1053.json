For the given function, w(x), the expression under the square root and the cube root must be nonnegative. Therefore, we have the following inequalities:\n$$x-2 \\ge 0$$ \nand \n$$x-3 \\ge 0$$ \nSolving these inequalities, we get:\n$$x \\ge 2$$ \nand \n$$x \\ge 3$$ \nTherefore, the domain of the function w(x) is the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to 3.
