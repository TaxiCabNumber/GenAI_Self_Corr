At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe have that $3 \\cdot f(x) + 4 \\cdot g(x) = h(x)$ where $f(x),$ $g(x),$ and $h(x)$ are all polynomials in $x.$ If the degree of $f(x)$ is $8$ and the degree of $h(x)$ is $9$, then what is the minimum possible degree of $g(x)$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nWe know that the degree of $g(x)$ is at least $1$, since $3 \\cdot f(x) + 4 \\cdot g(x)$ has degree at most $9$.  However, it could be as high as $9$, since $h(x)$ has degree $9$.  For example, we could have $f(x) = x^8$, $g(x) = x^9$, and $h(x) = 3x^8 + 4x^9$.  Thus, the minimum possible degree of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the degree of $h(x)$ is $9,$ that means there is a $x^9$ term in $h(x).$ That term cannot come from $f(x),$ since its degree is $8,$ so it must come from $g(x).$ That means the degree of $g(x)$ has to be at least $\\boxed{9},$ and indeed, it can only be $9.$"
