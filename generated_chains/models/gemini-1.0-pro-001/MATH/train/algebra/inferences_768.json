At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree aluminum cans can be recycled to make a new can. How many new cans can eventually be made from 243 aluminum cans? (Remember that the first new cans that are made can then be recycled into even newer cans!)  Do not include the original 243 cans in your count.",
        "inference": "Chain-of-thought:\n\nYou can recycle 3 cans to make 1 new can. So, you can recycle 243 cans to make 243/3 = 81 new cans. Then, you can recycle 81 cans to make 81/3 = 27 new cans. Then, you can recycle 27 cans to make 27/3 = 9 new cans. Then, you can recycle 9 cans to make 9/3 = 3 new cans. Finally, you can recycle 3 cans to make 3/3 = 1 new can.\n\nThe total number of new cans is the sum of these numbers: 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{121}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We start with $243 = 3^5$ cans. After recycling these cans, we will have made $243\\cdot\\frac13 = 3^4$ new cans. We can then recycle these new cans to make $3^4\\cdot\\frac13 = 3^3$ new cans. Continuing this process, we want to find the sum $3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0$. This is a finite geometric series with first term $81$, common ratio $1/3$, and five terms. Thus, the sum is $\\frac{81\\left(1-\\left(\\frac13\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac13} = \\boxed{121}$."
