At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLee can make 18 cookies with two cups of flour. How many cookies can he make with three cups of flour?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of cookies per cup of flour:\n18 cookies / 2 cups = 9 cookies / cup\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply the number of cups of flour by the number of cookies per cup:\n3 cups * 9 cookies / cup = 27 cookies\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$27$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of cookies that Lee can make with three cups of flour. We can set up the proportion $\\frac{18}{2} = \\frac{x}{3}$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{27}$."
