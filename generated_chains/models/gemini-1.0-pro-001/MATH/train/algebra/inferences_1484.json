        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJames is six years older than Louise. Eight years from now, James will be four times as old as Louise was four years before now. What is the sum of their current ages?",
        "inference": "Let Louise's age be \\(x\\). Then James' age is \\(x + 6\\). In eight years, Louise's age will be \\(x + 8\\) and James' age will be \\(x + 6 + 8 = x + 14\\). Eight years from now, James will be four times as old as Louise was four years before now. So, we have:\n\n$$x + 14 = 4(x - 4)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n$$x + 14 = 4x - 16$$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$$-3x = -30$$\n\nDividing both sides by -3:\n\n$$x = 10$$\n\nTherefore, Louise's current age is 10 and James' current age is 10 + 6 = 16. The sum of their current ages is 10 + 16 = 26.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$26$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $J$ represent James's current age and $L$ represent Louise's current age. Since James is six years older than Louise, we get $J=L+6$. We're also told in words that $J+8=4(L-4)$. We can substitute for $J$ in terms of $L$ into the second equation to get \\[(L+6)+8=4(L-4).\\] Expanding both products gives \\[ L+14=4L-16.\\] Adding 16 to both sides and subtracting 14 from both sides gives  $30=3L$, so $l=10$. So Louise is currently 10 years old, which means James is currently $10+6=16$ years old. The sum of their current ages is $10+16=\\boxed{26}$ years."
