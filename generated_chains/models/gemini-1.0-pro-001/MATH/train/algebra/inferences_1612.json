        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular room has a perimeter of 42 feet and an area of 108 square feet. What is the length, in feet, of the shorter side?",
        "inference": "1. Let the width be $w$ and the length be $l$.\n2. We have a perimeter of $42$ which gives us the equation $2w+2l=42$.\n3. We have an area of $108$ which gives us the equation $wl=108$.\n4. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get $2w(21-w)=108$.\n5. Expanding and simplifying, we get $42w-2w^2=108$.\n6. Subtracting $108$ from both sides, we get $-2w^2+42w-108=0$.\n7. Dividing both sides by $-2$, we get $w^2-21w+54=0$.\n8. Factoring, we get $(w-18)(w-3)=0$.\n9. So, $w=18$ or $w=3$.\n10. The width cannot be $18$, so $w=3$.\n11. Substituting $w=3$ into the first equation, we get $2(3)+2l=42$.\n12. Simplifying, we get $6+2l=42$.\n13. Subtracting $6$ from both sides, we get $2l=36$.\n14. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $l=18$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
