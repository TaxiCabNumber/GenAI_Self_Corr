        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of four positive integers that form an arithmetic sequence is 46. Of all such possible sequences, what is the greatest possible third term?",
        "inference": "Let the four numbers be x-3d, x-d, x+d, and x+3d.\nThen x-3d+x-d+x+d+x+3d = 46,\n4x = 46,\nx = 11.5.\nThe greatest possible third term is x+d = 11.5+d.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{11.5+d}$.**  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first term be $a$, and let the common difference be $d$.  Then the four positive integers are $a$, $a + d$, $a + 2d$, and $a + 3d$.  The sum of these four positive integers is $4a + 6d = 46$, so $2a + 3d = 23$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = (23 - 2a)/3$.\n\nThe third term is \\[a + 2d = a + 2 \\cdot \\frac{23 - 2a}{3} = \\frac{46 - a}{3}.\\] Thus, to maximize this expression, we should minimize $a$.  Since $a$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $a$ is 1.  Furthermore, when $a = 1$, $d = (23 - 2)/3 = 7$, which gives us the arithmetic sequence 1, 8, 15, 22.  Therefore, the greatest possible third term is $\\boxed{15}$."
