At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle is called cool if the number of square units in its area is equal to twice the number of units in its perimeter. A cool rectangle also must have integer side lengths. What is the sum of all the different possible areas of cool rectangles?",
        "inference": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively. Then the area is $A = lw$ and the perimeter is $P = 2l + 2w$. Given that $A = 2P$, we have\n\n$$lw = 2(2l + 2w) \\Rightarrow lw = 4l + 4w \\Rightarrow l(w - 4) = 4w$$\n\nSince $l$ is an integer, $w - 4$ must also be an integer. Therefore, $w - 4$ is a divisor of $4w$, which means $w - 4 = 1$, $2$, or $4$.\n\n* If $w - 4 = 1$, then $w = 5$ and $l = 20$. The area is $A = lw = 20 \\cdot 5 = 100$.\n* If $w - 4 = 2$, then $w = 6$ and $l = 12$. The area is $A = lw = 12 \\cdot 6 = 72$.\n* If $w - 4 = 4$, then $w = 8$ and $l = 8$. The area is $A = lw = 8 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the different possible areas of cool rectangles is $100 + 72 + 64 = \\boxed{236}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{236}$. I hope it is correct.",
