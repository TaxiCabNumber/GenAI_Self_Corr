        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the mean of all solutions for $x$ when $x^3 + 3x^2 - 10x = 0$.",
        "inference": "We can factor the left-hand side of the equation as $x(x^2 + 3x - 10)$. The two factors are $x$ and $x^2 + 3x - 10$. Setting each factor equal to zero, we have $x = 0$ and $x^2 + 3x - 10 = 0$. Solving the quadratic, we have $x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-10)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 7}{2}$. Therefore, the three solutions for $x$ are $0, -2$, and $5$. The mean of these three numbers is $\\frac{0 + (-2) + 5}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we factor the equation as $x(x^2 +3x - 10) = 0$.  So, one solution is $x=0$ and the other two solutions are the solutions to $x^2 + 3x-10=0$.  We could either factor the quadratic, or note that the sum of the solutions to this quadratic is $-(3/1)=-3$, so the mean of the three solutions to the original equation is $-3/3=\\boxed{-1}$."
