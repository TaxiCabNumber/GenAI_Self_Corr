At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Academic Academy, to pass an algebra test you must score at least $80\\%$. If there are 35 problems on the test, what is the greatest number you can miss and still pass?",
