At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the Hardey Fitness Center, the management did a survey of their membership. The average age of the female members was 40 years old. The average age of the male members was 25 years old. The average age of the entire membership was 30 years old. What is the ratio of the female to male members? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let \\(f\\) be the number of female members and \\(m\\) be the number of male members.  \n\nThe total number of members is \\(f + m\\). The total age of the membership is \\(40f + 25m\\) years.  \n\nSince the average age of the entire membership is 30 years, we have: \\(\\frac{40f + 25m}{f+m} = 30\\).  \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \\(40f + 25m = 30f +30m\\).  \n\nSubtracting \\(30f\\) from both sides, we get: \\(10f = 5m\\).  \n\nDividing both sides by 5, we get: \\(f = \\frac{1}{2}m\\). \n\nTherefore, the ratio of female to male members is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}:1}\\). \n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}:1}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ denote the number of male members and $f$ the number of female members.  The sum of the ages of the female members is $40f$ and the sum of the ages of the male members is $25m$.  The sum of the ages of all the members is $40f+25m$, and the total number of members is $f+m$.  Since the average age for all the members is $30$, we have \\[\n\\frac{40f+25m}{f+m}=30.\n\\] Multiply both sides by $f+m$ to get \\[\n40f+25m=30f+30m.\n\\] Collecting like terms we find $10f=5m$ so $f/m=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
