At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the domain of the function $$\\ell(y) = \\frac{1}{(y-2)+(y-8)}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "The denominator of the function must not be equal to zero. So, we need to solve the equation $$(y-2)+(y-8)=0$$\n$$y-2+y-8=0$$\n$$2y-10=0$$\n$$2y=10$$\n$$y=5$$\n\nTherefore, the function is not defined for $y = 5$. Thus, the domain of the function is $(-\\infty, 5) \\cup (5, \\infty)$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty, 5) \\cup (5, \\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can simplify: $$\\ell(y) = \\frac{1}{2y-10}.$$ The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y-10}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y-10=0,$$ which is $y=5$. Thus the domain of $\\ell(y)$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,5)\\cup (5,\\infty)}$."
