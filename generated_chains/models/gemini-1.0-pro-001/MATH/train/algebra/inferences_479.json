At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt time $t=0,$ a ball is thrown downward at 24 feet per second from a height of 160 feet above the ground.  The equation $h = -16t^2 - 24t +160$ describes the height (in feet) of the ball. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal.",
