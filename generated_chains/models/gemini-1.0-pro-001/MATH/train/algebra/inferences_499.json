At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "$\\sqrt[3]{10}\\approx2.154,\\quad \\sqrt[3]{200}\\approx5.848$\n\nSince the cube roots are approximately 2.154 and 5.848, there are approximately $5.848-2.154=3.694$ whole numbers between $\\sqrt[3]{10}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{200}$. Since whole numbers are discrete, there are actually $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $2^3=8$ and $3^3=27$, we know that $2<\\sqrt[3]{10}<3$. Then we find that $5^3=125$ and $6^3=216$, so $5<\\sqrt[3]{200}<6$. We have $\\sqrt[3]{10}<3$ and $5<\\sqrt[3]{200}$. The whole numbers between $\\sqrt[3]{10}$ and $\\sqrt[3]{200}$ are $3,4,5$, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ whole numbers."
