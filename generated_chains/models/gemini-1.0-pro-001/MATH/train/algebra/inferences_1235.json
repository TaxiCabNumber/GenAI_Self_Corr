        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the degree of the polynomial $(x^4+ax^7+bx+c)(x^3+dx^2+e)(x+f)$, where letters $a$ through $f$ are all nonzero constants?",
        "inference": "The degree of the first polynomial is 7.\nThe degree of the second polynomial is 3.\nThe degree of the third polynomial is 1.\n\nThe degree of the product of the three polynomials is the sum of their degrees, so the degree of the polynomial is $7+3+1=\\boxed{11}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to determine the degree of a polynomial, we need to know the largest exponent of the variable in the polynomial. When we multiply out the expression above, the term with the largest exponent results from the product of the terms with the largest exponents within each multiplied quantity. These terms are $ax^7$, $x^3$, and $x$. Taking the product of all of these terms $ax^7\\cdot x^3\\cdot x=ax^{11}$, we find that the largest exponent is $\\boxed{11}$."
