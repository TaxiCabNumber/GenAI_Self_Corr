At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose a function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $[-8,4]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(-2x),$$ then what is the domain of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",

So the range of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(-8\\le x\\le 4\\).\n\nSince \\(g(x) = f(-2x)\\), the range of \\(f(x)\\) must be the domain of \\(g(x)\\).\n\nTherefore, the domain of \\(g(x)\\) is \\(-8\\le -2x\\le 4\\).\n\nDividing by -2, we get \\(4\\ge x\\ge -2\\).\n\nTherefore, the domain of \\(g(x)\\) is \\boxed{[-2,4]}.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{[-2,4]}.

        "ground_truth": "We have $g(x) = f(-2x)$, which is defined if and only if $-2x$ is in the domain of $f$, that is, if $$-8 \\le -2x \\le 4.$$ Dividing all expressions in this chain of inequalities by $-2$ compels us to reverse the direction of the inequalities: $$4\\ge x\\ge -2.$$ Thus $g(x)$ is defined if and only if $-2\\le x\\le 4$. In other words, the domain of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-2,4]}$."
