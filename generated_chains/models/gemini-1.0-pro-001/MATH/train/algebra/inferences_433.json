Given that $x>1$, what is $n$?",

Distance from the origin is $n$: $$\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=n$$\n4. Solving for $y$: $$y^2=144\\Rightarrow y=\\pm12$$ \n5.

        "ground_truth": "First, we know that this point is above the $x$-axis because it is closer to a point in the first quadrant than it is to the $x$-axis. Next, we know that $y=12$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(12-6)^2}=10 \\\\\nx^2-2x+1+36&=100 \\\\\nx^2-2x-63&=0 \\\\\n(x-9)(x+7)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x-9=0$ or $x+7=0$, so $x=9$ or $x=-7$. $x=9$ by the given conditions.
