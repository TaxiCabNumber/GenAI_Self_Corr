        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe quotient of two positive integers is $\\frac{5}{2}$ and their product is 160. What is the value of the larger of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the two integers as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). From the given information, we have:\n$$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{2}$$\n\n$$xy = 160$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\(x\\):\n$$x = \\frac{5y}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n$$(\\frac{5y}{2})y = 160$$\n\n$$5y^2 = 320$$\n\n$$y^2 = 64$$\n\n$$y = 8$$\n\nSubstituting \\(y = 8\\) back into the equation for \\(x\\), we get:\n$$x = \\frac{5(8)}{2}$$\n\n$$x = 20$$\n\nTherefore, the larger of the two integers is \\boxed{20}.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2x$ be the smaller integer.  Then the larger integer is $5x$.  The product of the integers is 160, so $(2x)(5x)=160\\implies 10x^2=160 \\implies x^2=16$.  Since $x$ is positive, this implies $x=4$ which in turn implies that the larger integer is $5\\cdot4=\\boxed{20}$."
