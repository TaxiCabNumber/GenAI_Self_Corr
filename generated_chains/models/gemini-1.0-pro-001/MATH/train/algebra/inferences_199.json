At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 21 is the sum of two consecutive integers 10 and 11. What is the largest number of positive, consecutive integers whose sum is 21?",
        "inference": "Since 10 and 11 are consecutive integers whose sum is 21, the next two consecutive integers are 12 and 13, whose sum is 25. Therefore, we need to find the largest integer n such that the sum of n consecutive integers is less than or equal to 21.\n\nThe sum of n consecutive integers starting from x is equal to x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + n - 1) = n * (x + (n - 1) / 2).\n\nSetting this equal to 21 and solving for x, we get:\n\nn * (x + (n - 1) / 2) = 21\nx + (n - 1) / 2 = 21 / n\n\nSince x is an integer, 21 / n must also be an integer. The factors of 21 are 1, 3, 7, and 21. Trying each of these values for n, we find that n = 3 works:\n\n3 * (x + (3 - 1) / 2) = 21\nx + 1 = 7\nx = 6\n\nTherefore, the largest number of positive, consecutive integers whose sum is 21 is 3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we see that $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$.  If a number is the sum of seven or more consecutive positive integers, then the number must be at least $1 + 2 + \\dots + 7 = 7 \\cdot 8/2 = 28$, so $\\boxed{6}$ is the largest number of consecutive integers we can use."
