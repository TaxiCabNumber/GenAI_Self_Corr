At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers $n$ satisfy $200 < n^2 < 900$?",
        "inference": "We have $200 < n^2 < 900$, so $14.142 < n < 30$. Since $n$ is an integer, $n \\in \\{15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29\\}$. Thus, there are 15 integers $n$ satisfying the inequality.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $f(n)=n^2$ is a monotonically increasing function (on the set of positive integers), we can find the least and greatest integer solutions and count the integers between them.  Since $14^2=196$ and $15^2=225$, $n=15$ is the smallest solution.  Since $30^2=900$, $n=29$ is the largest solution.  There are $29-15+1=\\boxed{15}$ integers between 15 and 29 inclusive."
