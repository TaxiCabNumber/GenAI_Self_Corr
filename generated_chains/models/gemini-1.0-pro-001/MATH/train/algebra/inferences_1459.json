        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is 399, and the value of the fraction $\\frac{x}{y}$ is 0.9. What is the value of $y - x$?",
        "inference": "Let's call $y$ the numerator of the fraction and $x$ the denominator. We know that:\n$$ \\frac{y}{x} = 0.9 $$\nand \n$$ x + y = 399 $$\n\nWe can solve for $x$ in the second equation:\n$$ x = 399 - y $$\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n$$ \\frac{y}{399 - y} = 0.9 $$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $399 - y$, we get:\n$$ y = 0.9(399 - y) $$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n$$ y = 359.1 - 0.9y $$\n$$ 1.9y = 359.1 $$\n$$ y = 188.9 $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation $x + y = 399$, we get:\n$$ x = 399 - 188.9 = 210.1 $$\n\nTherefore, $y - x = 188.9 - 210.1 = \\boxed{-21.2}.$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-21.2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 399 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{y} &= 0.9 \\\\\n\\end{align*} From the second equation, multiplying both sides by $y$ gives $x=.9y$. Next, substituting the second equation into the first to eliminate $x$ gives $.9y+y=399$, or $y=210$. Plugging in this value into the first equation in the original system of equations gives $x+210=399$ or $x=189$. Thus, $y-x=210-189=\\boxed{21}$."
