        "inference": "Because $x^2 + bx + 2008 = (x + a)(x + c)$, we have $a + c = b$ and $ac = 2008$.  Since $a$ and $c$ are integers and $2008 = 2^5 \\cdot 127$ is divisible by $4$ and not divisible by $8$, we must have one of the factors of $2008$ even and the other one odd.  Since $2008 = 1 \\cdot 2008 = 2 \\cdot 1004 = 4 \\cdot 502 = 8 \\cdot 251$, the only way to have one of the factors even and the other odd is $a = 2$ and $c = 1004$.  Therefore, $b = a + c = 2 + 1004 = \\boxed{1006}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1006}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The question implies that we can factor the given quadratic as \\begin{align*}\nx^2+bx+2008 &= (x+r)(x+s)\\\\\n& = x^2+(r+s)x+rs, \\end{align*} where $r$ and $s$ are integers.  Since both $b$ and 2008 are positive, it is clear that $r$ and $s$ must also be positive.  By multiplying out the right-hand side as shown, we see that we must have $rs=2008$, which has prime factorization $2008=2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2\\cdot 251$.  Recall that we are trying to minimize $b=r+s$.  The best we can do is to let $r=251$ and $s=8$, leading to $b=251+8=\\boxed{259}$."
