At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of $k$ does the line represented by the equation $1-kx = -3y$ contain the point $(4,-3)$?",

        "ground_truth": "Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\\cdot -3 \\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{-2}$."
