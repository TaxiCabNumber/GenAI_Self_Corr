I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of three real numbers forms an arithmetic progression with a first term of 9. If 2 is added to the second term and 20 is added to the third term, the three resulting numbers form a geometric progression. What is the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression?",
        "inference": "Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the original three numbers in arithmetic progression. Then, $b=a+d$ and $c=a+2d$ for some common difference $d$.\n\nSince the second term of the arithmetic progression is increased by 2 to form the second term of the geometric progression, we have $b+2=ar$ for some common ratio $r$.\n\nSince the third term of the arithmetic progression is increased by 20 to form the third term of the geometric progression, we have $c+20=ar^2$.\n\nSubstituting $b=a+d$ and $c=a+2d$ into these equations, we get $a+d+2=ar$ and $a+2d+20=ar^2$.\n\nSolving for $a$ in the first equation, we get $a=\\frac{2}{r-1}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get $\\frac{2}{r-1}+2d+20=\\frac{2r}{r-1}$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $2d=\\frac{2(r-20)}{r-1}$, so $d=\\frac{r-20}{r-1}$.\n\nSubstituting this into $b=a+d$, we get $b=\\frac{2}{r-1}+\\frac{r-20}{r-1}=\\frac{r-18}{r-1}$.\n\nFinally, substituting this into $c=a+2d$, we get $c=\\frac{2}{r-1}+2\\frac{r-20}{r-1}=\\frac{2r-38}{r-1}$.\n\nTo find the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression, we need to find the smallest possible value for $r$ such that $c+20$ is positive.\n\nSetting $c+20>0$, we get $\\frac{2r-38}{r-1}+20>0$.\n\nSolving for $r$, we get $r>4$.\n\nThe smallest possible value for $r$ such that $c+20$ is positive is $r=5$.\n\nSubstituting this into $c=\\frac{2r-38}{r-1}$, we get $c=\\frac{2(5)-38}{5-1}=\\frac{-28}{4}=-7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The terms of the arithmetic progression are 9, $9+d$, and $9+2d$ for some real number $d$. The terms of the geometric progression are 9, $11+d$, and $29+2d$. Therefore \\[\n(11+d)^{2} = 9(29+2d) \\quad\\text{so}\\quad d^{2}+4d-140 = 0.\n\\]Thus $d=10$ or $d=-14$. The corresponding geometric progressions are $9, 21, 49$ and $9, -3, 1,$ so the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $\\boxed{1}$."
