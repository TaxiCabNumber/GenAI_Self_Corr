At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are polynomials in $z$, and the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$.  If the degree of $f(z)$ is two, what is the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of a sum of polynomials is the larger of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\nSince the degree of $g(z)$ is less than the degree of $f(z)$, and the degree of $f(z)$ is 2, the degree of $g(z)$ must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf the degree of $g(z)$ is 0, then $g(z)$ is a constant, and the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is 2.\n\nIf the degree of $g(z)$ is 1, then the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree of $f(z)+g(z)$ is 2 in either case.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have $f(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+a_1 \\cdot z+a_0$, and $g(z)=b_1 \\cdot z+b_0$, where $a_2$ is nonzero.  Then $f(z)+g(z)=a_2 \\cdot z^2+(a_1+b_1) \\cdot z+(a_0+b_0)$.  The degree of this polynomial is $\\boxed{2}$."
