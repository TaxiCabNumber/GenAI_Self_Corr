At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the first and third of three consecutive integers is 118. What is the value of the second integer?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the first integer. Then the second and third integers are $x+1$ and $x+2$, respectively. According to the given information, we have:\n\n$$x+(x+2)=118$$\n\n$$2x+2=118$$\n\n$$2x=116$$\n\n$$x=58$$\n\nTherefore, the second integer is $x+1=\\boxed{59}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{59}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the second integer, then the first integer is $n-1$ and the third integer is $n+1$.  The sum of the first and third integers is $2n$, so $n=118/2=\\boxed{59}$."
