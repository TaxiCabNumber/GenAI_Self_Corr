At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA geometric sequence of positive integers is formed for which the first term is 3 and the fourth term is 192. What is the third term of the sequence?",
        "inference": "Given that the first term ($a_1$) is 3 and the fourth term ($a_4$) is 192, we can use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:\n$$a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$$\nwhere $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nWe know that $a_1 = 3$ and $a_4 = 192$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n$$a_4 = a_1 \\cdot r^{4-1}$$\n$$192 = 3 \\cdot r^3$$\n$$r^3 = 64$$\n$$r = 4$$\n\nNow that we know the common ratio, we can find the third term ($a_3$) using the formula:\n$$a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$$\n$$a_3 = 3 \\cdot 4^{3-1}$$\n$$a_3 = 3 \\cdot 4^2$$\n$$a_3 = 3 \\cdot 16$$\n$$a_3 = 48$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}.
