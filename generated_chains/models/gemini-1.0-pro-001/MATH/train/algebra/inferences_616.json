        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three consecutive one-digit, positive, odd integers is one-seventh of the product of the same three integers. What is the middle integer when the three integers are listed in ascending order?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the middle integer. Then the other two integers are \\(x-2\\) and \\(x+2\\). The sum of the three integers is \\(x+(x-2)+(x+2)=3x\\). The product of the three integers is \\(x(x-2)(x+2)=x^3-2x^2-2x^2+4x=x^3-4x^2+4x\\). Since the sum of the three integers is one-seventh of the product of the same three integers, we have\n\n$$3x=\\frac{1}{7}(x^3-4x^2+4x).$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 7, we get\n\n$$21x=x^3-4x^2+4x.$$\n\nSubtracting \\(x^3-4x^2+4x\\) from both sides, we get\n\n$$0=x^3-7x^2+21x.$$\n\nFactoring, we get\n\n$$0=x(x^2-7x+21).$$\n\nSince \\(x\\) is a positive integer, we must have \\(x^2-7x+21=0\\). Factoring, we get\n\n$$(x-3)(x-4)=0.$$\n\nTherefore, \\(x=3\\) or \\(x=4\\). Since \\(x\\) is the middle integer, we have \\(x=4\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Represent the three integers as $n-2$, $n$, and $n+2$, where $n$ is the middle integer.  The problem states that  \\[\nn(n-2)(n+2)=7(n+(n+2)+(n-2)),\n\\] which simplifies to $(n-2)(n+2)=21$.  Since $7\\cdot3$ and $21\\cdot1$ are the only representations of 21 as a product of two positive integers, we see that $n-2=3$ and $n+2=7$ which implies $n=\\boxed{5}$."
