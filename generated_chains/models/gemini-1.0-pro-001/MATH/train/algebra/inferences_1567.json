At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball bounces back up $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from which it falls. If the ball is dropped from a height of $243$ cm, after how many bounces does the ball first rise less than $30$ cm?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n1st bounce: $243\\times\\frac{2}{3}=162$ cm.\n2nd bounce: $162\\times\\frac{2}{3}=108$ cm.\n3rd bounce: $108\\times\\frac{2}{3}=72$ cm.\n4th bounce: $72\\times\\frac{2}{3}=48$ cm.\n5th bounce: $48\\times\\frac{2}{3}=32$ cm.\n\n**Final Answer: 5. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If you call the number of bounces $b$, then this problem can be phrased as: what is the minimum $b$, such that $243\\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < 30 \\rightarrow \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < \\frac{30}{243}$, at which point you can take the logarithm of both sides and solve for it exactly, but given that you can use your calculator, it's much easier to just multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ with itself repeatedly until the product is less than $\\frac{30}{243}$.  Regardless of how you do it, you will get $b = \\boxed{6}$."
