        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nUri buys two burgers and a soda for $\\$2.10$, and Gen buys a burger and two sodas for $\\$2.40$. How many cents does a soda cost?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the cost of a burger in cents and \\(y\\) be the cost of a soda in cents.\nThen, the first purchase will be: 2x + y = 210 (since $2.10 = 210$ cents)\nand the second purchase will be: x + 2y = 240 (since $2.40 = 240$ cents)\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\ny = 30\nTherefore, the cost of a soda is 30 cents.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{30}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents. So, Uri's two burgers and a soda cost 210 cents and Gen's food costs 240 cents. Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents. We are trying to find the value of $s$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. These equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2b + s &= 210 \\\\\nb + 2s &= 240 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are solving for $s$, so we want to eliminate $b$ from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $2b+4s = 480$, or $2b = 480 - 4s$. Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $b$, we get that $(480 - 4s) + s = 210$, or $s=90$. Thus, a soda costs $\\boxed{90}$ cents."
