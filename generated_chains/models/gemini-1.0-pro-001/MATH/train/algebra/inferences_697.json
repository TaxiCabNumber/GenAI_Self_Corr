At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo regular polygons have the same perimeter. If the first has 38 sides and a side length twice as long as the second, how many sides does the second have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of sides of the second polygon. The perimeter of the first polygon is $38 \\cdot 2 = 76$ and the perimeter of the second polygon is $x \\cdot 1 = x$. Since the perimeters are the same, we have $76 = x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{76}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first have side length $2s$ and the second $s$. Then the perimeter of the first is $38\\cdot2s=76s$. Since this is the perimeter of the second as well, the second has $76s/s=\\boxed{76}$ sides."
