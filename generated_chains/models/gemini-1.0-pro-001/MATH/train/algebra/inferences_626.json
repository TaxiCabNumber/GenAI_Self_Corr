        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the game of Frood, dropping $n$ froods gives a score of the sum of the first $n$ positive integers. For example, dropping five froods scores $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$ points. Eating $n$ froods earns $10n$ points. For example, eating five froods earns $10(5) = 50$ points. What is the least number of froods for which dropping them will earn more points than eating them?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of froods for which dropping them will earn more points than eating them.\nDropping $n$ froods earns $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ points.\nEating $n$ froods earns $10n$ points.\nSo, we have $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 10n$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 10n > 0$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{n^2+n-20n}{2} > 0$\n$\\Rightarrow \\frac{n^2-19n}{2} > 0$\n$\\Rightarrow n^2-19n > 0$\n$\\Rightarrow n(n-19) > 0$\n$\\Rightarrow n > 19$ or $n < 0$\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we have $n > 19$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dropping $n$ Froods earns $1 + 2 +\\ldots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ points.  Eating $n$ Froods earns $10n$ points.  So we seek the least $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} > 10n$.  Solving, we see that $n > 19$.  Thus, $n = \\boxed{20}$ is our desired answer."
