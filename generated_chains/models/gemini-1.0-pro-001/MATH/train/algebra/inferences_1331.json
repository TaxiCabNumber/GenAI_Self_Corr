At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x)$ is a function defined only for $0 \\le x \\le 1$, and $f(x) = ax+b$ for constants $a$ and $b$ where $a < 0$, then what is the range of $f$ in terms of $a$ and $b$?

Therefore, the range of $f$ is the set of all outputs $y$ such that there is some input $x$ in the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$ for which $f(x) = y$.\n\nThe minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$ occurs at $x = 1$, and the maximum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$ occurs at $x = 0$.

        "ground_truth": "The function $f(x) = ax + b$ is linear, so as $x$ varies over the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$, $f(x) = ax + b$ takes on all values between $b$ and $a + b$ (inclusive).  Furthermore, $a < 0$, so $a + b < b$.  Hence, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[a +b, b]}$."
