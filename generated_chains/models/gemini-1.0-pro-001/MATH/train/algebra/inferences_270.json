        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integer values of $x$ is $x^2 < 7x$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n$$x^2 < 7x$$\n\n$$x^2 - 7x < 0$$\n\n$$x(x - 7) < 0$$\n\nTherefore, $x$ must be between $0$ and $7$.\n\nThe only integer values that satisfy this are $x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\n\n**Final Answer: $6$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we see that $0$ does not satisfy the inequality, so we can divide by $x$.  If $x$ is positive, we can divide to get $x<7$, and there are $6$ positive integers satisfying this. If $x$ is negative, we divide to get $x>7$, which is not satisfied by any negative integers.  So the number of integer solutions is $\\boxed{6}$."
