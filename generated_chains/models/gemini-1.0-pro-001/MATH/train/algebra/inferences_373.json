        "inference": "**Step 1: Vieta's Formulas**\n\nVieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with positive roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, we have:\n\n* $r_1 + r_2 = -\\frac{b}{a}$\n* $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = \\frac{c}{a}$\n\n**Step 2: Apply Vieta's Formulas**\n\nFor the given polynomial $x^2 - 5x + t$, we have:\n\n* $r_1 + r_2 = 5$\n* $r_1 \\cdot r_2 = t$\n\n**Step 3: Positivity Conditions**\n\nSince the roots are positive, we have $r_1 > 0$ and $r_2 > 0$. Therefore, $t$ must be positive.\n\n**Step 4: Find Possible Values of $t$**\n\nFrom the first Vieta's formula, we have $r_1 = 5 - r_2$. Substituting this into the second Vieta's formula, we get:\n\n* $t = r_1 \\cdot r_2 = (5 - r_2) \\cdot r_2 = 5r_2 - r_2^2$\n\nSince $r_2$ is positive, we have $t = 5r_2 - r_2^2 < 5r_2$. Also, since $t$ must be positive, we have $r_2 > 1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $r_2$ are $2, 3, 4$, and $5$. Corresponding to these values, we have:\n\n* $t_2 = 5 \\cdot 2 - 2^2 = 8$\n* $t_3 = 5 \\cdot 3 - 3^2 = 12$\n* $t_4 = 5 \\cdot 4 - 4^2 = 16$\n* $t_5 = 5 \\cdot 5 - 5^2 = 25$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Average**\n\nThe average of these values is:\n\n* Average = $\\frac{t_2 + t_3 + t_4 + t_5}{4} = \\frac{8 + 12 + 16 + 25}{4} = \\frac{61}{4}$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$15.25$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this polynomial. Since $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum and $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1+r_2=5$ and $r_1r_2=t$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are positive integers, the only possible ordered pairs $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),$ and $(4,1)$. These produce the values of 4,6,6, and 4 respectively for $t$. Therefore, the average of the distinct possibilities, 4 and 6, is $\\boxed{5}$."
