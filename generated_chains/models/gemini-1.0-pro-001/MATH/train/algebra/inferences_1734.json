At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

So, $11 < (x + 3)^2 < 31$.\n\nTaking square roots, $3 < x + 3 < 5$.\n\nSubtracting 3, $0 < x < 2$.\n\nThere are $2 - 0 = 2$ positive integers $x$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$. If $x$ must be positive, we can see that this expression can take on the value of any perfect square that is greater than or equal to 16.
