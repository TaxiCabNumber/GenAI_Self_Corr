        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional. When the sum of $x$ and $y$ is 42, $x$ is twice $y$. What is the value of $y$ when $x=-8$?",
        "inference": "Since $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, we can write $x=ky$ for some constant $k$.\n\nWhen the sum of $x$ and $y$ is 42, we have $x+y=42$. Substituting $x=ky$ into this equation, we get $ky+y=42$. Simplifying, we get $y(k+1)=42$.\n\nSince $x$ is twice $y$ when $x+y=42$, we have $x=2y$. Substituting $x=ky$ into this equation, we get $ky=2y$. Simplifying, we get $k=2$.\n\nTherefore, $x=2y$.\n\nWhen $x=-8$, we have $y=-4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that when $x+y=42$, $x=2y$. Substituting $2y$ in for $x$ in the first equation gives $3y=42$, or $y=14$. The value of $x$ is then $2(14)=28$. Since $x$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, the product $xy$ is constant. Let $xy=k$. When $x=28$ and $y=14$, $k=(28)(14)=392$. Therefore, when $x=-8$, $(-8)y=392$, giving $y=\\boxed{-49}$."
