At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent basketball game, Shenille attempted only three-point shots and two-point shots.  She was successful on $20\\%$ of her three-point shots and $30\\%$ of her two-point shots.  Shenille attempted $30$ shots.  How many points did she score?",
        "inference": "**Three-pointers made**\n\nShe made $20\\%$ of her three-point shots, so of the $30$ shots she attempted, $20\\%$ of them were three-pointers, i.e. $0.2 \\times 30 = 6$ three-pointers. \nSince each successful three-point shot is worth $3$ points, she scored $6 \\times 3 = 18$ points from three-pointers. \n\n**Two-pointers made** \nShe made $30\\%$ of her two-point shots, so of the $30$ shots she attempted, $30\\%$ of them were two-pointers, i.e. $0.3 \\times 30 = 9$ two-pointers. \nSince each successful two-point shot is worth $2$ points, she scored $9 \\times 2 = 18$ points from two-pointers. \n\n**Total score** \nAdding the points from three-pointers and two-pointers, her total score is $18 + 18 = \\boxed{36}$ points.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$36$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of attempted three-point shots made be $x$ and the number of attempted two-point shots be $y$.  We know that $x+y=30$.   We need to evaluate $(0.2\\cdot3)x +(0.3\\cdot2)y$, as we know that the three-point shots are worth 3 points and that she made $20\\%$ of them and that the two-point shots are worth 2 and that she made $30\\%$ of them.\n\nSimplifying, we see that this is equal to $0.6x + 0.6y = 0.6(x+y)$.  Plugging in $x+y=30$, we get $0.6(30) = \\boxed{18}$."
