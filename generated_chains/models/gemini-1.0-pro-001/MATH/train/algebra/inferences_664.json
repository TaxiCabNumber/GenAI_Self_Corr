        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.  Find $a+b$.",
        "inference": "Since $10^a < 17 < 10^b$, we have $a < \\log_{10}{17} < b$.  Thus $a = \\lfloor\\log_{10}{17}\\rfloor$ and $b = \\lceil\\log_{10}{17}\\rceil$.  Therefore, $a + b = \\lfloor\\log_{10}{17}\\rfloor + \\lceil\\log_{10}{17}\\rceil$.  We can use the fact that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lceil x \\rceil = 2x$ for any real number $x$ to get $a + b = 2\\log_{10}{17}$.  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{10}{17} \\approx 1.2304$.  Thus, $a + b = 2(1.2304) = \\boxed{2.4608}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.4608}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$."
