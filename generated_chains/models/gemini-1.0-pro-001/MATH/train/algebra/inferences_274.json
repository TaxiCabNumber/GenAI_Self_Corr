At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the domain of $y=\\dfrac{x^3-27}{x+27}$?  (Express your answer using interval notation.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe denominator of the given function is $x+27$. The denominator must not be equal to zero. Therefore,\n$$x+27\\neq0\\Rightarrow x\\neq-27.$$\nTherefore, the domain of the given function is $(-\\infty,-27)\\cup(-27,\\infty)$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-27)\\cup(-27,\\infty)}$.

        "ground_truth": "The only values of $x$ that would make this fraction undefined are values that makes the denominator $0$. Therefore, the fraction is undefined when $x+27=0$, or when $x=-27$. Hence, the solution is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-27)\\cup(-27,\\infty)}$."
