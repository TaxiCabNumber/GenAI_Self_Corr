At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the greatest value of $a$ such that $a^2-10a+21 \\le 0$.",
        "inference": "First, we find the roots of the quadratic equation $a^2-10a+21 = 0$. By completing the square, we have:\n\n$$a^2-10a+21 = (a^2-10a+25) - 4 = (a-5)^2-4.$$\n\nThus, the roots of the equation are $5\\pm 2$, or $3$ and $7$.\n\nSince the quadratic is negative between its roots, we have $a^2-10a+21 \\le 0$ when $3 \\le a \\le 7$.\n\nThe greatest value of $a$ in this interval is $a = 7$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We factor the quadratic, getting $(a-7)(a-3) \\le 0$. The expression is equal to $0$ when $a=7 \\text{ or } 3$. When $a \\le 3$ or $a \\ge 7$, the quadratic is positive, since the two factors have the same sign. When $3 \\le a \\le 7$, the quadratic is non-positive. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{7}$ is the greatest value of $a$ for which $a^2 - 10a + 21\\le 0$."
