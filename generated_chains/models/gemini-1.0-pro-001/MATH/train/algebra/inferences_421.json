At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJohn believes that the amount of sleep he gets the night before a test and his score on that test are inversely related.  On his first exam, he got eight hours of sleep and scored 70 on the exam.  To the nearest tenth, how many hours does John believe he must sleep the night before his second exam so that the average of his two exam scores is an 80?",
        "inference": "1. John believes that the amount of sleep he gets the night before a test and his score on that test are inversely related. This means that as the amount of sleep he gets increases, his score on the test decreases, and vice versa.\n\n\n2. We can represent this inverse relationship with the equation y = k/x, where y is the score on the test, x is the amount of sleep John gets the night before, and k is a constant.\n\n\n3. We can find the value of k by substituting the given values into the equation: 70 = k/8, which gives k = 560.\n\n\n4. So, the equation that represents the inverse relationship between John's sleep and his test score is y = 560/x.\n\n\n5. To find the amount of sleep John believes he must get the night before his second exam so that the average of his two exam scores is 80, we can use the formula for the average of two numbers: (x1 + x2)/2.\n\n\n6. Let's call the score on John's second exam y2 and the amount of sleep he gets the night before y2 x2. Then, the average of his two exam scores is (70 + y2)/2 = 80.\n\n\n7. Substituting the equation y = 560/x into the average equation, we get (70 + 560/x2)/2 = 80.\n\n\n8. Solving for x2, we get x2 = 8.57 hours.\n\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8.5} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, to average an 80, he must score a 90 on his second exam.  Now, since score and hours of sleep are inversely related, their product is a constant.  Thus $70\\cdot 8 = 90 \\cdot h \\Rightarrow h = 56/9 \\approx \\boxed{6.2}$."
