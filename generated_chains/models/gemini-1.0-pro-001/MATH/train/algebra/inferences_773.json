At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Fat needs 20 minutes to eat a pound of cereal, while Mr. Thin needs 30 minutes. If they eat together, how long does it take for them to finish off three pounds of cereal? Express your answer in minutes.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nIn 1 minute, Mr. Fat eats $\\frac{1}{20}$ of a pound of cereal, and Mr. Thin eats $\\frac{1}{30}$ of a pound of cereal. \n\nTogether, they eat $\\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{5}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{7}{60}$ of a pound of cereal in 1 minute. \n\nSo, they can finish 1 pound of cereal in $\\frac{60}{7}$ minutes. \n\nSince there are 3 pounds of cereal, it will take them $3 \\cdot \\frac{60}{7} = \\boxed{25.71}$ minutes to finish off the three pounds of cereal.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$25.71$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Fat eats cereal at a rate of $\\frac{1}{20}$ pound a minute, and Mr. Thin eats cereal at a rate of $\\frac{1}{30}$ pound a minute. Together, they eat cereal at a rate of $\\frac1{20}+\\frac1{30} = \\frac{1}{12}$ pound a minute. At this rate, it will take them $\\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{12}} = \\boxed{36}$ minutes to eat 3 pounds of cereal."
