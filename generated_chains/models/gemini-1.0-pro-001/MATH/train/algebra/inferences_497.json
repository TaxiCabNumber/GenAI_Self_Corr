        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of the floor in a square room is 225 square feet. The homeowners plan to cover the floor with rows of 6-inch by 6-inch tiles. How many tiles will be in each row?",
        "inference": "1. First, convert the area of the floor to square inches: 225 square feet * (144 square inches / 1 square foot) = 32,400 square inches.\n\n\n2. Then, find the area of one tile: 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches.\n\n\n3. Finally, divide the area of the floor by the area of one tile to find the number of tiles in each row: 32,400 square inches / 36 square inches = 900 tiles.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{900}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The length of each side of the room is $\\sqrt{225}=15$ feet, or $15\\cdot12=180$ inches. Since each tile has a length of 6 inches, each row needs $180/6=\\boxed{30}$ tiles."
