        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ is 60. If we decrease $a$ by 7, we get the value $N$. If we increase $b$ by 7, we get the value $N$. If we multiply $c$ by 7, we also get the value $N$. What is the value of $N$?",
        "inference": "Let's call the original value of $N$ as $x$.\n\nWhen we decrease $a$ by 7, we get $N$, so $a = x+7$.\n\nWhen we increase $b$ by 7, we get $N$, so $b = x-7$.\n\nWhen we multiply $c$ by 7, we get $N$, so $c = \\frac{x}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the original equation, we get:\n\n$$(x+7)+(x-7)+\\left(\\frac{x}{7}\\right)=60$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$2x+\\frac{x}{7}=60$$\n\n$$14x+x=420$$\n\n$$15x=420$$\n\n$$x=28$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $N$ is $28$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$28$}.
