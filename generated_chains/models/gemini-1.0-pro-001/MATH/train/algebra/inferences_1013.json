At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRural School USA has 105 students enrolled. There are 60 boys and 45 girls. If $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the boys and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the girls are absent on one day, what percent of the total student population is absent?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n1. Find the number of absent boys and girls.\n$$\\frac{1}{10} \\times 60 = 6 \\text{ absent boys}$$\n\n$$\\frac{1}{3} \\times 45 = 15 \\text{ absent girls}$$\n\n\n2. Find the total number of absent students and the total number of enrolled students.\n$$6 + 15 = 21 \\text{ absent students}$$\n\n$$60 + 45 = 105 \\text{ enrolled students}$$\n\n\n3. Find the percent of the total student population that is absent.\n$$\\frac{21}{105} \\times 100 = 20 \\text{% absent}$$\n\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$20$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "$\\frac{1}{10}$ of $60$ boys is $60/10=6$ students, while $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $45$ girls is $45/3=15$ students, so $21$ students were absent that day. Since we know that $\\frac{21}{105}=\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$ is equal to $20\\%$, we know that $\\boxed{20 \\%}$ of the total student population was absent."
