At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four points $A(-4,0), B(0,-4), X(0,8),$ and $Y(14,k)$ are grouped on the Cartesian plane. If segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $XY$ what is the value of $k$?",
        "inference": "Since segments $AB$ and $XY$ are parallel, their slopes must be equal. \n\nThe slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{-4-0}{0-(-4)}=\\frac{-4}{4}=-1$. \n\nThus, the slope of $XY$ must also be $-1$. \n\nThe slope of $XY$ is $\\frac{k-8}{14-0}=\\frac{k-8}{14}$. \n\nSetting this equal to $-1$ and solving for $k$, we get:\n\n$\\frac{k-8}{14}=-1$\n\n$k-8=-14$\n\n$k=-6$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Lines that are parallel have the same slope. In this case, $AB$ has a slope of $(0 - (-4))/(-4 - 0) = -1.$ This now must be the slope for $XY$. Now we can use the equation $y_2 - y_1 = m(x_2 - x_1)$ to find the value of $k$. Plugging in the coordinates for $Y$ and $X$ we find that $k - 8 = -1(14 - 0)$, thus $k = -14 + 8 = -6$. We also could see that from $(0, 8)$ to $(14, k)$ we are moving 14 units right, so we also must move 14 units down to get a slope of $-14/14 = -1$. Moving 14 units down from $(0, 8)$ lands us at $(0, 8 - 14)$ or $(0, -6)$, so $k = \\boxed{-6}$."
