At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $x$ and $y$ are integers such that  $xy+5x+4y=-5$.  Find the greatest possible value of $y$.",
        "inference": "First, we can factor the left side of the equation as follows:\n\n$$xy+5x+4y=-5 \\Rightarrow x(y+5)+4(y+5)=-25 \\Rightarrow (x+4)(y+5)=-25.$$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are integers, $x+4$ and $y+5$ must be integers as well. Moreover, since $-25=-1\\times25=-5\\times5$, the only possible pairs of factors are $(-1,25)$ and $(-5,5)$. Since $x+4$ is positive, we must have $x+4=25$ and $y+5=-1$. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we get $x=21$ and $y=-6$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $y$ is $\\boxed{-6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $(x+4)(y+5)$ equals $xy+5x+4y+20$.  So, add $20$ to both sides of the original equation to get $xy+5x+4y+20=15$, so now we may apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and write the equation as $(x+4)(y+5)=15$.\n\nThen, the potential ordered pairs $((x+4),(y+5))$ with $x<y$ are $(-15,-1)$, $(-5,-3)$, $(1,15)$ and $(3,5)$, since these are the pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  The greatest value for $y+5$ is thus $15$.  We solve $y+5=15$ for $y$ to yield $y=\\boxed{10}$."
