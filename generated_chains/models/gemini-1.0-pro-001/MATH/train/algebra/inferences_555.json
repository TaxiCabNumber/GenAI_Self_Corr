        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile watching a circus show, I counted out the number of acrobats and elephants. I counted 40 legs and 15 heads. How many acrobats did I see in the show?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of acrobats and y be the number of elephants.\nAcrobats have 2 legs each, so x * 2 = number of legs from acrobats.\nElephants have 4 legs each, so y * 4 = number of legs from elephants.\nTotal number of legs = x * 2 + y * 4 = 40\nNumber of heads = x + y = 15\nSolving the second equation for x, we get x = 15 - y\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get (15 - y) * 2 + y * 4 = 40\nSimplifying: 30 - 2y + 4y = 40\n2y = 10\ny = 5\nSubstituting y back into x = 15 - y, we get x = 15 - 5 = 10\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of acrobats in the show be $a$ and the number of elephants be $e$. We are looking for the value of $a$. Assuming that each acrobat has 2 legs and 1 head, and that each elephant has 4 legs and 1 head, we can set up the following system of equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2a+4e &= 40 \\\\\na + e &= 15 \\\\\n\\end{align*}To solve for $a$, we need to eliminate $e$ from the equations above. We can rewrite the second equation above as $e=15-a$, and substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $e$ gives $2a+4(15-a) = 40$, or $a=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ acrobats in the circus show."
