        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the largest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-9n+18$ is negative.",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Factor the quadratic expression:\n$$n^2-9n+18 = (n-6)(n-3)$$\n\n**Step 2**: Determine the intervals where the expression is negative:\nThe expression is negative when both factors are negative, which occurs when $n<3$ and $n>6$.\n\n**Step 3**: Find the largest integer that satisfies these conditions:\nThe largest integer that satisfies $n<3$ is $n=2$. However, this does not satisfy the condition $n>6$. Therefore, there is no integer value of $n$ that satisfies both conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{-\\infty}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \\begin{align*} n^2-9n+18&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (n-3)(n-6)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since 3 and 6 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points. Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$. For $n<3$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $3<n<6$, only $n-6$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $n>6$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $3<n<6$. Since the question asks for the largest integer value of $n$, the answer is the largest integer smaller than 6, which is $\\boxed{5}$."
