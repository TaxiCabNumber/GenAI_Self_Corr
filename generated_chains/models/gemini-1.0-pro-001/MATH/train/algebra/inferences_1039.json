        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a bag with blue marbles and yellow marbles in it. At the moment, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 8:5. If I remove 12 blue marbles and add 21 yellow marbles, the ratio will be 1:3. How many blue marbles were in the bag before I removed some?",
        "inference": "Let the initial number of blue marbles be 8x and the initial number of yellow marbles be 5x.\n\nAfter removing 12 blue marbles, the number of blue marbles becomes 8x - 12.\n\nAfter adding 21 yellow marbles, the number of yellow marbles becomes 5x + 21.\n\nWe are given that the new ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 1:3, which can be expressed as\n\n(8x - 12) / (5x + 21) = 1/3\n\nCross-multiplying, we get\n\n3(8x - 12) = 5x + 21\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get\n\n24x - 36 = 5x + 21\n\nSubtracting 5x from both sides, we get\n\n19x - 36 = 21\n\nAdding 36 to both sides, we get\n\n19x = 57\n\nDividing both sides by 19, we get\n\nx = 3\n\nTherefore, the initial number of blue marbles was 8x = 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles and $y$ the number of yellow marbles before I added more. We are given that the ratio of blue to yellow is 8:5, so $\\dfrac{x}{y}=\\dfrac{8}{5}$. Additionally, after we remove blue marbles and add yellow marbles the total number of blue marbles and yellow marbles will be $x-12$ and $y+21$ respectively. We're given that at this point the ratio will be $1:3$, so $\\dfrac{x-12}{y+21}=\\dfrac{1}{3}$. Cross multiplying the first equation gives $5x=8y$ and cross multiplying the second gives $3(x-12)=1(y+21)$. Solving two linear equations on two variables is routine; we get the solution $y=15$, $x=24$. Since $x$ represents the number of blue marbles before some were removed, the answer to the problem is just $\\boxed{24}$."
