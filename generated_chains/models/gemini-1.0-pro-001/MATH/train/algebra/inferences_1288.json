        "inference": "Since $9x^2 + 24x + a$ is the square of a binomial, it can be expressed as $(cx+d)^2$. Expanding this, we get:\n\n$$(cx+d)^2 = c^2x^2 + 2cdx + d^2$$\n\nEquating the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constant term on both sides, we have:\n\n$$c^2 = 9$$\n\n$$2cd = 24$$\n\n$$d^2 = a$$\n\nSolving for $d$, we get:\n\n$$d = \\pm 4$$\n\nSubstituting $d = 4$ into the equation $d^2 = a$, we get:\n\n$$a = 4^2 = 16$$\n\nTherefore, $a = \\boxed{16}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$.

        "ground_truth": "If $9x^2 +24x + a$ is the square of a binomial, then the binomial has the form $3x +b$ for some number $b$, because $(3x)^2 = 9x^2$.  So, we compare $(3x+b)^2$ to $9x^2 + 24x + a$. Expanding $(3x+b)^2$ gives \\[(3x+b)^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(b) + b^2 = 9x^2 + 6bx + b^2.\\]Equating the linear term of this to the linear term of $9x^2+24x+a$, we have $6bx=24x$, so $b=4$.  Equating the constant term of $9x^2 + 6bx + b^2$ to that of $9x^2 + 24x+a$ gives us $a=b^2 = \\boxed{16}$."
