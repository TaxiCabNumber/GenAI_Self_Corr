At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-28/1=-28$, so the other solution must be $-28/-7=4$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-7+4=-3$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=-3$ and $b=\\boxed{3}$."
