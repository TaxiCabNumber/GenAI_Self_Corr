At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2+a^2$.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $(-b/2a, c-b^2/4a)$.

        "ground_truth": "The given parabola has vertex at $(0,a^2)$. The line $y=x+a$ passes through this point if and only if $a^2=0+a$. Rearranging the equation gives $a^2-a=0$. Factoring an $a$ out of the left hand side yields $a(a-1)=0$, so $a=0$ or $a=1$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possible values of $a$."
