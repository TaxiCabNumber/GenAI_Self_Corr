        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice buys three burgers and two sodas for $\\$3.20$, and Bill buys two burgers and a soda for $\\$2.00$. How many cents does a burger cost?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the cost of a burger and $y$ be the cost of a soda.\nFrom the givens: $$\\begin{align} 3x + 2y &=  3.20 \\\\\\ 2x + y &=  2.00 \\end{align}$$\nSubtract (2) from (1): $$x = 1.20$$\nSubstitute $x$ in (2): $$\\begin{split} 2(1.20) + y &=  2.00 \\\\\\ y &=  0.40 \\end{split}$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$120$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's work with this problem in cents, not dollars, because the answer calls for a number in cents. So, Alice's three burgers and two sodas cost 320 cents and Bill's food costs 200 cents. Let a burger cost $b$ cents and a soda cost $s$ cents. We are trying to find the value of $b$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. These equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3b + 2s &= 320 \\\\\n2b + s &= 200 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We are solving for $b$, so we want to eliminate $s$ from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2, we get $4b+2s = 400$, or $2s = 400 - 4b$. Substituting this equation into the first equation above to eliminate $s$, we get that $3b + (400-4b) = 320$, or $b=80$. Thus, a burger costs $\\boxed{80}$ cents."
