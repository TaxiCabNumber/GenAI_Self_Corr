        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne root of the equation $5x^2+kx=4$ is 2. What is the other?",
        "inference": "If 2 is a root of the equation, then $5(2)^2+k(2)=4$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $20+2k=4$.\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get $2k=-16$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $k=-8$.\nTherefore, the other root of the equation is:\n$x=\\frac{-k}{5\\cdot2}=\\frac{8}{10}=\\frac{4}{5}$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Rearranging the given equation, we get $5x^2+kx-4=0$. That means that the product of the roots of the equation is $-4/5$. If one of the roots of the equation is 2, then the other must be $(-4/5)/2=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{5}}$."
