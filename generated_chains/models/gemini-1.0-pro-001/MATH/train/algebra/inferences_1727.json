At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDiana is three years younger than Eduardo. Eduardo is four years older than Chad. Faye is three years older than Chad. Diana is 14 years old. How many years old is Faye?",
        "inference": "Diana is 14 years old.\nDiana is three years younger than Eduardo. So Eduardo is 14 + 3 = 17 years old.\nEduardo is four years older than Chad. So Chad is 17 - 4 = 13 years old.\nFaye is three years older than Chad. So Faye is 13 + 3 = 16 years old.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$ denote the ages of Chad, Diana, Eduardo, and Faye.  We are given three equations. \\begin{align*}\nD&=E-3 \\\\\nE&=C+4 \\\\\nC+3&=F\n\\end{align*} Summing these three equations, we find that $E$ and $C$ cancel to leave $D+3=F+1$, which implies $F=D+2$.  Since $D=14$, we have $F=\\boxed{16}$."
