At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: I first need to determine how many hours I would have worked during those first two weeks.\n\n```\nHours not worked = 2 weeks x 20 hours/week\n```\n\nSo,\n\n```\nHours not worked = 2 x 20 = 40 hours\n```\n\n**Step 2**: Given that, I still need to earn $3000, \n\n```\nTotal hours needed to work = Total earnings ($3000) / Earnings per hour\n```\n\n**Step 3**: The earnings per hour are unknown and need to be determined. Let's set it to x.\n\n```\nTotal hours needed to work = $3000 / x\n```\n\n**Step 4**: I reduce the total hours needed to work by the hours I didn't work in the first two weeks.\n\n```\nHours to work for the rest of the summer = $3000 / x - 40 hours\n```\n\n**Step 5**: I know that I had planned to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks, which gives a total of 240 hours.\n\n```\nHours to work for the rest of the summer = 240 hours - 40 hours = 200 hours\n```\n\n**Step 6**: Finally, I divide this value by the remaining number of weeks (10) to find the number of hours I need to work per week.\n\n```\nHours to work per week = 200 hours / 10 weeks\n```\n\n```\nHours to work per week = 20 hours\n```\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{$20 hours$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week."
