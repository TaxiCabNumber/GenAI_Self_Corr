        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $3+a=4-b$ and $4+b=7+a$, what is $3-a$?",
        "inference": "$3+a=4-b$\n$\\Rightarrow a=-1-b$\n\n$4+b=7+a$\n$\\Rightarrow b=3+a$\n$\\Rightarrow b=3-(-1-b)$\n$\\Rightarrow b=3+1+b$\n$\\Rightarrow 0=4$ (contradiction)\n\nTherefore, there is no solution.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{impossible}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n3+a&=4-b, \\\\\n4+b&=7+a.\n\\end{align*}Adding the two equations, we get $3+a+4+b=4-b+7+a$, which simplifies to $7+a+b=11+a-b$. Cancelling $a$ from both sides, we get $7+b=11-b$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=2$. Plugging this into the first equation above, we obtain $3+a=4-2$. Hence $a=-1$ and $3-a=\\boxed{4}$."
