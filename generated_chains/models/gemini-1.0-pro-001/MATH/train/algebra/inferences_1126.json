        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA student accidentally added five to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, changing the fraction's value to $\\frac12$. If the original numerator was a 2, what was the original denominator?",
        "inference": "Let's call the original denominator $x$. Then, the original fraction was $\\frac2x$. After adding five to both the numerator and denominator, we get $\\frac{2 + 5}{x + 5}=\\frac12$. Cross-multiplying, we get $2(x + 5) = 1(x + 2)$, which simplifies to $2x + 10 = x + 2$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $x + 10 = 2$, which simplifies to $x = -8$. So, the original denominator was $\\boxed{-8}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the original denominator.  After adding 5 to both numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes $\\frac{7}{d+5}$.  If a fraction with 7 in the numerator is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}$, then the denominator is 14.  Solving $d+5=14$, we find $d=\\boxed{9}$."
