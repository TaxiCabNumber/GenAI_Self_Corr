At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA squirrel travels at a constant 4 miles per hour. How long does it take for this squirrel to travel 1 mile? Express your answer in minutes.",
        "inference": "1 mile = 4 miles per hour * x hours\n1 mile = 4 * x hours\nx hours = 1 / 4 hours\nx hours = 0.25 hours\nx hours = 0.25 * 60 minutes\nx hours = 15 minutes\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{15}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{rate}$, we see that it takes the squirrel $\\frac{1}{4}$ hour to travel 1 mile. This is equal to $\\boxed{15}$ minutes."
