I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
        "inference": "To find the maximum height of the ball, we need to find the vertex of the parabola, which is the point where the parabola changes direction. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by the following formula:\n\n$$t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $a = -16$ and $b = 80$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is:\n\n$$t = -\\frac{80}{2(-16)} = 2.5$$\n\nTo find the height of the ball at the vertex, we plug the $x$-coordinate back into the original equation:\n\n$$h = -16(2.5)^2+80(2.5)+21 = 102.5$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum height of the ball is $102.5$ feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{102.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet."
