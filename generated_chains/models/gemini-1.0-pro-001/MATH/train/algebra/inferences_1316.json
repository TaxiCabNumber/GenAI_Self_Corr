        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNote that $9^2 = 81$, which contains no zeros; $99^2 = 9801$, which contains 1 zero; and $999^2 = 998,\\!001$, which contains 2 zeros. Assuming this pattern continues, how many zeros are in the expansion of $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$?",
        "inference": "Since this pattern continues, $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$ will have 6 zeros.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The pattern suggests that for a number with $n$ nines, that number squared has $n-1$ zeros. Thus, $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$ should have $8-1=7$ zeros. To prove this, we note that $99,\\!999,\\!999=10^8-1$, so $99,\\!999,\\!999^2=(10^8-1)^2=10^{16}-2\\cdot10^8+1$. Consider this last expression one term at a time. The first term, $10^{16}$, creates a number with 16 zeros and a one at the front. The second term, $2\\cdot10^8$, is a number with 8 zeros and a two at the front. The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 7 nines, then an eight, then 8 zeros. Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a one. Thus, we are left with $\\boxed{7}$ zeros."
