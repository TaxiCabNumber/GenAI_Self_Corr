        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\#$ be the relation defined by $A \\# B = A^2 + B^2$. If $A \\# 5 = 169$, what is the positive value of $A$?",
        "inference": "Since $A \\# 5 = 169$, we have $A^2 + 5^2 = 169$.\nSolving this equation for $A$, we get $A^2 = 169 - 25 = 144$.\nTaking the positive square root of both sides, we get $A = \\boxed{12}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using the definition given in the problem, we have $A^2+5^2=169=13^2$. Recognizing this as Pythagorean Theorem for a 5-12-13 right triangle, $A=\\boxed{12}$."
