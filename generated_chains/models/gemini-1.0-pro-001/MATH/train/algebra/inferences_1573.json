At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles. If it took Steve 24 minutes to run 3 miles, using the same rates, how many minutes would it take Jordan to run 5 miles?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nIf Steve ran 3 miles in 24 minutes, then it took him 8 minutes to run 1 mile.\nIf Jordan ran 2 miles in half the time it took Steve to run 3 miles, then it took Jordan 4 minutes to run 1 mile.\nIf it took Jordan 4 minutes to run 1 mile, then it would take him 4 * 5 = 20 minutes to run 5 miles.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since Steve's 3-mile time is 24 minutes, Jordan ran 2 miles in $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot24=12$ minutes.  Therefore, each mile takes Jordan 6 minutes to run, so he would take $6\\cdot5=\\boxed{30}$ minutes to run five miles."
