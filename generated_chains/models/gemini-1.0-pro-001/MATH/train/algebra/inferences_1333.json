        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many square units are in the area of the triangle whose vertices are the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of the curve $y = (x-3)^2 (x+2)$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**: \nThe values of $x$ that satisfy $y=0$ are $x=3$ and $x=-2$. So the $x$-intercepts of the curve are $(3,0)$ and $(-2,0)$. \n\nSubstituting $y=0$ into the equation, we get $0=(x-3)^2(x+2)$. This gives three values for $x$: $x=3,x=-2$ and $x=0$. So the $y$-intercepts of the curve are $(0,0), (3,0)$ and $(-2,0)$. \n\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$(base)(height). The base of the triangle is the distance between the $x$-intercepts, which is $3-(-2)=5$. The height of the triangle is the distance between the $y$-intercept and the line segment connecting the $x$-intercepts. The equation of the line segment connecting the $x$-intercepts is $y=0$. The distance between the $y$-intercept and the line segment can be found by substituting $x=0$ into the equation of the curve to get $y=9$. So the height of the triangle is $9$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(5)(9)=\\boxed{22.5}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{22.5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we need to find where this curve intersects the $x$ and $y$ axes.  If $y=0$, then $(x-3)^2(x+2)=0$, which has solutions of $x=3$ and $x=-2$.  If $x=0$, then $y=(-3)^2(2)=18$.  So, the curve has two $x$-intercepts and one $y$-intercept.  The length of the base along the $x$-axis is $3-(-2)=5$.  The height from this base is equal to the $y$-intercept, 18.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5\\cdot 18=\\boxed{45}$."
