        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven identical bowling balls weigh the same as four identical canoes. If three of the canoes weigh a total of 84 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
        "inference": "1) We know that 7 bowling balls weigh the same as 4 canoes.\n\n2) So, 1 bowling ball weighs the same as 4/7 canoes.\n\n3) We also know that 3 canoes weigh 84 pounds.\n\n4) So, 1 canoe weighs 84/3 pounds.\n\n5) Therefore, 1 bowling ball weighs (4/7) * (84/3) pounds.\n\n6) Simplifying this expression, we get 1 bowling ball weighs (4 * 84) / (7 * 3) pounds.\n\n7) This simplifies to 1 bowling ball weighs 336 / 21 pounds.\n\n8) Dividing 336 by 21, we get 1 bowling ball weighs 16 pounds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe. We have that $7b=4c$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$, we have $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 7b=\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 4c \\Rightarrow \\frac{21}{4}b=3c=84$. Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\\boxed{16}$ pounds."
