At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the polynomial $x^2-kx+16$ has only positive integer roots, find the average of all distinct possibilities for $k$.",
        "inference": "Let the positive integer roots be $a$ and $b$, where $a<b$. Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have $$a+b=k \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad ab=16.$$ Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive integers, the only possible values for $a$ and $b$ are $1$ and $16$, or $2$ and $8$, or $4$ and $4$. In the first case, $k=17$, in the second case, $k=10$, and in the third case, $k=8$. Therefore, the average of all distinct possibilities for $k$ is $$\\frac{17+10+8}{3}=\\frac{35}{3}.$$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{3}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the roots of this polynomial be $r_1$ and $r_2$. Since $\\frac{c}{a}$ is the product and $-\\frac{b}{a}$ is the sum of the roots of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we have $r_1r_2=16$ and $r_1+r_2=k$. Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are integers, both must be factors of 16. The only possible combinations for $(r_1,r_2)$ are $(16,1),(8,2),(4,4)$, and the inverses of each ordered pair, which replicate values of $k$ already accounted for. Therefore, the only possible values of $k$ are 17,10, and 8, which average to $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{3}}$."
