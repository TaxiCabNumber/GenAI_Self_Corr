At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -6t^2 - 10t + 56$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 10 feet per second from a height of 56 feet from the surface from Mars. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "We need to find the time when the ball hits the ground, which means when its height is 0. So we set $y = 0$ and solve for $t$:\n\n$$0 = -6t^2 - 10t + 56$$\n\n$$6t^2 + 10t - 56 = 0$$\n\n$$(3t - 4)(2t + 14) = 0$$\n\n$$3t - 4 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2t + 14 = 0$$\n\n$$3t = 4 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2t = -14$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad t = -7$$\n\nSince the ball cannot hit the ground at a negative time, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the ball hits the ground at $t = \\frac{4}{3} = 1.33$ seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.33}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Setting $y$ to zero, we find the following:\n\\begin{align*}\n-6t^2 - 10t + 56 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 6t^2 + 10t - 56 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 3t^2 + 5t - 28 &= 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad (3t-7)(t+4) &= 0.\n\\end{align*}As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx \\boxed{2.33}.$"
