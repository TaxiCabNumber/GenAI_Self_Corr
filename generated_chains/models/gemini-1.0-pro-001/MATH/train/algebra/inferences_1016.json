At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo calculate $41^2$, David mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds 81. David subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $39^2$. What number does he subtract?",
        "inference": "The difference between $40^2$ and $39^2$ is:\n\n$$40^2 - 39^2 = (40+39)(40-39) = 79 \\times 1 = 79$$\n\nSo David subtracts $79$ from $40^2$ to calculate $39^2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{79}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We see that $39^2 = (40 - 1)^2 = 40^2 - 2\\cdot 40 \\cdot 1 +1 = 40^2 - 79$. Therefore, David subtracts $\\boxed{79}$."
