At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBoth roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$ are prime numbers. How many possible values of $k$ are there?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe sum of the roots is 63, and the product is $k$.\n\nIf at least one root is 2, then the other root should be 61, since they are prime (and distinct), and $2 + 61 = 63$. In this case, we have $k = 2 \\cdot 61 = 122$.\n\nIf neither root is 2, then the prime numbers must be 3 and 21 (since they are the only two primes that add up to 63). In this case, we have $k = 3 \\cdot 21 = 63$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possible values of $k$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ and $q$ be two primes that are roots of $x^2 - 63 x + k = 0$. Then $$\nx^2 - 63 x + k = (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + p \\cdot q,\n$$ so $p + q = 63$ and $p\\cdot q=k$. Since $63$ is odd, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other $61$. Thus, there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for $k$, namely $k = p\\cdot q = 2\\cdot 61=122$."
