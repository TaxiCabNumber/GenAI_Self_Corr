At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two positive consecutive integers is 506. What is their sum?",
        "inference": "Let x be the first integer. Then the second integer is x + 1.\nWe know that x(x + 1) = 506.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get x^2 + x - 506 = 0.\nFactoring, we get (x - 22)(x + 23) = 0.\nSo, x = 22 or x = -23.\nSince x is a positive integer, we have x = 22.\nTherefore, the sum of the two integers is 22 + (22 + 1) = 45.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are given that $x(x+1) = 506$, so $x^2 + x = 506$, which means $x^2 + x - 506 =0$.  The prime factorization of $506$ is $2\\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$, so we see that the quadratic factors as $(x + 23)(x-22)=0$.  The positive solution is $x=22$, so the two numbers are 22 and 23.  Their sum is $22+23 = \\boxed{45}$."
