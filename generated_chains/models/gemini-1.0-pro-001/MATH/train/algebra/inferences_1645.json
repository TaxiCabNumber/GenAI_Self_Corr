        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the ten volumes of the collected works of Theodore Sturgeon is available in paperback for $\\$$15 or in hardcover for $\\$$25. Theresa buys a copy of each of the ten volumes for a total of $\\$$220. How many hardcover volumes did she buy?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of hardcover volumes Theresa bought. Then the number of paperback volumes she bought is $10-x$. The total cost of the hardcover volumes is $25x$ dollars, and the total cost of the paperback volumes is $15(10-x)$ dollars. The total cost of all the volumes is $220 dollars, so we have the equation:\n\n$$25x+15(10-x)=220$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$25x+150-15x=220$$\n\n$$10x+150=220$$\n\n$$10x=70$$\n\n$$x=7$$\n\nTherefore, Theresa bought $\\boxed{7}$ hardcover volumes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Say she bought $h$ hardcovers and $p$ paperbacks. She bought ten volumes total, so $h+p=10$. Her total cost, $25h+15p$, was $220$, or dividing by 5 $5h+3p=44$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second, we get $5h-3h+3p-3p=2h=44-30=14$, or $h=\\boxed{7}$."
