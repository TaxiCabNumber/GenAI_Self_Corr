At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoann rode her bike at an average speed of 12 miles per hour for three and a half hours. If her friend, Fran, rides for 3 hours, at what average speed, in miles per hour, would she have to ride her bike to travel the same distance that Joann traveled?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the distance Joann traveled in three and a half hours.**\n\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 12 mph \u00d7 3.5 hours\nDistance = 42 miles\n\n**Step 2: Find Fran's average speed to travel the same distance in 3 hours.**\n\nAverage Speed = Distance / Time\nAverage Speed = 42 miles / 3 hours\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$14 mph$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours, Joann covers $\\left(3\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ hours}\\right)(12\\text{ mph})=42$ miles.  If Fran's average speed in miles per hour is $s$, then Fran covers $3s$ miles in $3$ hours.  Solving $3s=42$ we find $s=\\boxed{14}$ miles per hour."
