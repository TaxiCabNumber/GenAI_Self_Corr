        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\\$$660. How many days did he not work?",
        "inference": "Let's assume that Sam worked for \\(x\\) days and did not work for \\(20-x\\) days.\n\nThen, his earnings from working days are: $$60x$$\n\nAnd, his deductions from non-working days are: $$30(20-x)=600-30x$$\n\nTherefore, his total earnings are: $$60x-600+30x=90x-600$$\n\nSince he received $\\$$660 at the end of the 20-day period, we have: $$90x-600=660$$\n\nSolving for \\(x\\): $$90x=660+600$$ $$90x=1260$$ $$\\boxed{x=\\frac{1260}{90}=14}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{14}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days."
