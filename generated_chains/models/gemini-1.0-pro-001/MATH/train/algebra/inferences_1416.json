I hope it is correct.'\nA tree doubled its height every year until it reached a height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years. What was the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years?",
        "inference": "The height doubles every year, so after 3 years, the height will be half of its height at the end of 6 years.\n\nThe height at the end of 6 years is 32 feet.\n\nTherefore, the height at the end of 3 years is 32 / 2 = 16 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Going backwards, we see that the tree was $32/2 = 16$ feet at the end of 5 years, $16/2 = 8$ feet at the end of 4 years, and $8/2 = \\boxed{4 \\text{ feet}}$ at the end of 3 years."
