        "inference": "In order to find the amount of money that needs to be invested, we can use the formula for compound interest:\n$$A = P(1 + \\frac{r}{n})^{nt},$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the amount of money after $t$ years, $P$ is the principal (the amount of money invested), $r$ is the annual interest rate, $n$ is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded, and $t$ is the number of years.\n\nLet's first plug in the values that we know:\n$$500000 = P(1 + \\frac{0.05}{1})^{1 * 10}$$$$500000 = P(1.05)^{10}$$\n\nNow we can solve for $P$ by dividing both sides by $(1.05)^{10}$:\n$$\\frac{500000}{(1.05)^{10}} = P$$\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that\n$$P \\approx 338,228.77$$\n\nTherefore, the amount of money that should be invested is $338,228.77.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$338,228.77}.
