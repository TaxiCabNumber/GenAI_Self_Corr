        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Complete the square for both x and y terms.\n\n$$x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$$\n\n$$(x-2)^2-4+ (y-9)^2-81=-21$$\n\n$$(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2= 76$$\n\n**Step 2:** Identify the center and the radius.\n\nThe equation is in the form $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Thus, the center is (2,9) and the radius is $\\sqrt{76}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{76}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\\boxed{8}$."
