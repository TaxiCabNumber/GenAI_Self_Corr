At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJulie works for 48 hours per week for 12 weeks during the summer, making $\\$5000$. If she works for 48 weeks during the school year at the same rate of pay and needs to make another $\\$5000$, how many hours per week must she work?",

I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since she only needs to make the same amount of money, if she works for 4 times as many weeks, she can work 4 times fewer hours per week, meaning she can work $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 48 = \\boxed{12}$ hours per week."
