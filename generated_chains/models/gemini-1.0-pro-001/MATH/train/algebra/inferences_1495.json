At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $f(x)=\\frac{1}{2x+b}$. For what value of $b$ does $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{2x}$?",
        "inference": "1. $f(x)=\\frac{1}{2x+b}$\n2. Interchanging $x$ and $y$, we get $y=\\frac{1}{2x+b}$\n3. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{1-2y}{2y}$\n4. Therefore, $f^{-1}(x)=\\frac{1-2x}{2x}$\n5. Comparing this with the given expression, we get $b=1$\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$b=1$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Substituting $f(x)$ into the equation $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1 - 2x}{2x}$, and noting that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, we get \\[x = \\frac{1 - 2f(x)}{2f(x)}.\\] Solving for $f(x)$, we get \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{2x + 2}.\\] Therefore, $b = \\boxed{2}$."
