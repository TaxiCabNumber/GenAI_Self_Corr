At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn infinite geometric series has common ratio $1/8$ and sum 60.  What is the first term of the series?",
        "inference": "The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by\n$$S=\\frac{a_1}{1-r} \\Rightarrow a_1=S(1-r)$$\nwhere a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio.  In this case, S=60 and r=1/8, so\n$$a_1=60\\left(1-\\frac{1}{8}\\right)=60\\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)=52.5$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52.5}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is 60, we have  $$60= \\frac{a}{1-(1/8)} = \\frac{a}{7/8} = \\frac{8a}{7}.$$Therefore, $a=\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot60=\\boxed{\\frac{105}{2}}$."
