I hope it is correct.'\nA ball is dropped from 1000 feet high and always bounces back up half the distance it just fell. After how many bounces will the ball first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot?",

        "ground_truth": "We have a geometric sequence with first term 1000 and common ratio $1/2$. Any term in this sequence can be represented as $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k=500$, or the height of the $k=1^\\text{st}$ bounce). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $1000\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k<1$.
