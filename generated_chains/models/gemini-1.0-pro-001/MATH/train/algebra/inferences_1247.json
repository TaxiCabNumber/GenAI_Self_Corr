We don't know the first term directly, but we can use the fifth term and the common ratio to find it:\n\n$$a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^4 = 11$$\n\n$$a_1 = \\frac{11}{r^4} = \\frac{11}{(\\frac{5}{11})^4} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 11^4}{5^4} = 121$$\n\n**Step 3: Find the eighth term.**\n\nThe eighth term is the term with index $8$. We can use the first term and the common ratio to find it:\n\n$$a_8 = a_1 \\cdot r^7 = 121 \\cdot (\\frac{5}{11})^7 = \\frac{121 \\cdot 5^7}{11^7}$$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the answer.**\n\n$$a_8 = \\frac{121 \\cdot 5^7}{11^7} = \\frac{121 \\cdot 5^7}{11^7} \\cdot \\frac{11^7}{11^7} = \\frac{121 \\cdot 5^7}{11^7}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$121 \\cdot 5^7/11^7$}.

Then, the eighth term of the sequence is equal to $11r^3$, and the eleventh term of the sequence is equal to $11r^6 = 5$. From the second equation, it follows that $r^6 = \\frac{5}{11} \\Longrightarrow r^3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{11}}$.
