        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFrom the following infinite list of numbers, how many are integers? $$\\sqrt{4096},\\sqrt[3]{4096},\\sqrt[4]{4096},\\sqrt[5]{4096},\\sqrt[6]{4096},\\ldots$$",

        "ground_truth": "Since $4096=2^{12}$, one of these is an integer if the number on the root is a factor of 12. Therefore, the only numbers in the list that are integers are $\\sqrt{4096}=2^6=64$, $\\sqrt[3]{4096}=2^4=16$, $\\sqrt[4]{4096}=2^3=8$, $\\sqrt[6]{4096}=2^2=4$ and $\\sqrt[12]{4096}=2$.
