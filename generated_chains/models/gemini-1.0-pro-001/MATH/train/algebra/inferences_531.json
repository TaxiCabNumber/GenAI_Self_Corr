At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$?",
        "inference": "The range of a function is the set of all possible output values. In other words, it is the set of all values that the function can take on.\n\nFor the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$, the range is the set of all positive real numbers. This is because the function is always positive, and it approaches infinity as $x$ approaches zero.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ is the set of all positive real numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} >0$ for all nonzero $x$. That is, the range of $f$ must only include positive numbers. Conversely, if $a$ is a positive number, then \\[f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}\\right)=\\frac{1}{(1/\\sqrt{a})^2} = a,\\]so $a$ is indeed in the range of $f$. Thus, the range of $f$ is the set of all positive real numbers; in interval notation, that's $\\boxed{(0,\\infty)}$."
