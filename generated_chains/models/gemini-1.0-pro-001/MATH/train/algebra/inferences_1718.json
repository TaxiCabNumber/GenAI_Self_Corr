At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Bank of Springfield's Super High Yield savings account compounds annually at a rate of one percent.  If Lisa invests 1000 dollars in one of these accounts, then how much interest will she earn after five years?  (Give your answer to the nearest dollar.)",
        "inference": "The amount of money in the account after $5$ years is given by the formula: \n$$ A = P (1 + r)^t $$\nwhere $P$ is the principal (initial investment), $r$ is the annual interest rate, and $t$ is the time in years.  In this case, $P = 1000$, $r = 0.01$, and $t = 5$, so we have: \n$$ A = 1000(1 + 0.01)^5 \\approx 1051 $$\n\nTherefore, Lisa will earn approximately $1051 - 1000 = \\boxed{$51}$ after five years.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$51$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At an annual interest rate of one percent, after five years, Lisa's investment will grow to $1000 \\cdot 1.01^5 = 1051$ dollars, to the nearest dollar.  Therefore, she earns $1051 - 1000 = \\boxed{51}$ dollars in interest."
