At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)=x^2-7x+18$ and let $g(f(x))=2x+3$. What is the sum of all possible values of $g(8)$?",

        "ground_truth": "We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $8$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =2x +3$.  So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $8$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(8)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = 8$, then we have $x^2 -7x +18 = 8$, so $x^2 -7x +10 = 0$, so $(x-2)(x-5)=0$ which means $x=2$ or $x=5$.  Since $x$ could be $2$ or $5$, we could have $g(8) = g(f(2))$ or $g(8) = g(f(5))$.  Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(8)$ are  $g(f(2)) = 2\\cdot2 +3 = 7$ and $g(f(5)) = 2\\cdot5+3 = 13$.  The sum of these is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$."
