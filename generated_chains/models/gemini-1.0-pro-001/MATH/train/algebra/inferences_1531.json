        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the parabola defined by the equation $y=(x-2)^2+3$ is rotated 180 degrees about its vertex, then shifted 3 units to the left, then shifted 2 units down. The resulting parabola has zeros at $x=a$ and $x=b$. What is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Rotating the parabola 180 degrees about its vertex has the effect of reflecting over the x-axis. This changes the equation to $y=-(x-2)^2+3$.\n\n**Step 2:** Shifting the parabola 3 units to the left has the effect of adding 3 to x. The equation becomes $y=-(x-2+3)^2+3=-(x+1)^2+3$.\n\n**Step 3:** Shifting the parabola 2 units down has the effect of subtracting 2 from y. The equation becomes $y=-(x+1)^2+3-2=-(x+1)^2+1$.\n\n**Step 4**: To find the zeros of the parabola, we set y = 0 and solve for x:\n\n$$0=-(x+1)^2+1$$\n\n$$(x+1)^2=1$$\n\n$$x+1=\\pm1$$\n\n$$x=0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x=-2$$\n\nTherefore, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=0+(-2)=\\boxed{-2}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-2}$.

Shifting this last parabola to the left changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+3$. Shifting it down changes its equation to $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. So the equation of $A'$ is $y=-(x+1)^2+1$. To find the zeros of this parabola, we set $y=0$ to get $0=-(x+1)^2+1$. Expanding the right hand side gives $0=-x^2-2x$. Dividing through by $-1$ and factoring out an $x$ from the right hand side, we get $0=x(x+2)$, so either $x=0$ or $x+2=0$. Thus, $a=0$ and $b=-2$, so $a+b=\\boxed{-2}$."
