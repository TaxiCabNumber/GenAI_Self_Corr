        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graphs of a function $f(x)=3x+b$ and its inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at the point $(-3,a)$. Given that $b$ and $a$ are both integers, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Given that $f(x)=3x+b$ and $f^{-1}(x)$, they intersect at $(-3,a)$.\n$f(-3)=3(-3)+b=-9+b=a$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$a=-9+b$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the graph of $f$ contains the point $(-3,a)$, we know that  \\[a=f(-3)=3(-3)+b=b-9.\\]Since the graph of $f^{-1}$ also contains this point we know that $f^{-1}(-3)=a$ or $-3=f(a)$.  Therefore \\[-3=f(a)=3a+b.\\]Substitution for $a$ gives \\[-3=3(b-9)+b=4b-27.\\]Therefore $b=\\frac14(27-3)=6$. This forces \\[a=b-9=6-9=\\boxed{-3}.\\]One could also recall that the graph of $f$ is a line and the graph of $f^{-1}$ is that line reflected through $y=x$.  Since the slopes of these lines are not 1, the lines both intersect $y=x$ at a single point and that point is also the point of intersection of the graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.  Therefore the intersection point must be $(-3,-3)$, giving $a=\\boxed{-3}$."
