At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJasmine had 3 paperclips on Monday, then she had 6 on Tuesday, and her number of paperclips proceeded to double on each subsequent day. On what day of the week did she first have more than 100 paperclips?",
        "inference": "On Monday, she had 3 paperclips. \nOn Tuesday, she had 6 paperclips. \nOn Wednesday, she had 12 paperclips. \nOn Thursday, she had 24 paperclips. \nOn Friday, she had 48 paperclips. \nOn Saturday, she had 96 paperclips. \nOn Sunday, she had 192 paperclips. \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Sunday}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "This is a geometric sequence with first term 3 and common ratio 2. Thus, any term in this sequence can be represented as $3\\cdot2^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$, where $k+1$ represents the term number (for example, when $k=0$, $3\\cdot2^k = 3$, which is the $k+1=1^\\text{st}$ term of the sequence). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $3\\cdot2^k>100$. Using trial and error, we find that $k=6$, which means that the $6+1=7^\\text{th}$ day is the the one on which Jasmine has more than 100 paperclips, or $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$."
