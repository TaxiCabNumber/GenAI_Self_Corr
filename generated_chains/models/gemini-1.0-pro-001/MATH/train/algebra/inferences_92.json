So  $$y=x+7-x+2=9.$$ If $-7\\leq x< 2$, $x+7$ is nonnegative and $x-2$ is negative.  So  $$y=x+7-(-x+2)=2x+5.$$ Then, $2(-7)+5=-9$, and $2(2)+5=9$.  The function is increasing and continuous, so all values between $-9$ and $9$ are produced, and no others. Thus the range is $y \\in \\boxed{[-9, 9]}$."
