At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Sanchez's students were asked to add two positive integers. Juan subtracted by mistake and got 2. Maria mistakenly multiplied and got 120. What was the correct answer?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be x and y. Juan subtracted, so his answer was x - y = 2. Maria multiplied, so her answer was x * y = 120. We can use this to find the values of x and y.\n x - y = 2\nx * y = 120\nWe can solve the first equation for x:\nx = 2 + y\nNow we can substitute this into the second equation:\n(2 + y) * y = 120\n2y + y^2 = 120\ny^2 + 2y - 120 = 0\n(y - 10)(y + 12) = 0\nSo y = 10 or y = -12. However, y is a positive integer, so y = 10. Substituting this back into the equation for x, we get:\nx = 2 + y = 12\nSo the two integers are x = 12 and y = 10, and the correct answer is 12 + 10 = 22.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the two positive integers $x$ and $y$. Without loss of generality, assume $x > y$. We can write a system of equations to represent the information given in the problem:  \\begin{align*}\nx - y &= 2 \\\\\nx \\cdot y &= 120\n\\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = y + 2$.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $(y + 2) \\cdot y = 120$, or $y^2 + 2y - 120 = 0$.\n\nThis quadratic equation factors into $(y + 12)(y-10) = 0$, so $y = 10$.\n\nGiven $y$, we can solve for $x$ to get $x = 12$, so $x + y = \\boxed{22}$."
