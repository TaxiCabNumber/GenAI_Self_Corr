        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the slope of the line $3x+5y=20$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Solve the equation for $y$.\n$$3x+5y=20$$\n$$5y=-3x+20$$\n$$y=-\\frac{3}{5}x+4$$\n\n**Step 2:** Identify the slope.\nThe slope of the line is the coefficient of $x$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation: $y=mx+b$. In this case, the slope is $-\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-3/5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the slope is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{5}}$."
