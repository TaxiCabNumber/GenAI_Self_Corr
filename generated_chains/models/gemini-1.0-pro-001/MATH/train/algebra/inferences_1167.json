This is because the denominator of the function, $$(t-1)^2+(t+1)^2,$$ is equal to zero at $t = 1$ and $t = -1$. Therefore, the function is undefined at these two values. In interval notation, the domain of the function is $$(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty).$$\n\nFinal Answer: $(-\\infty, -1) \\cup (-1, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty).$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The fraction $\\frac{1}{(t-1)^2+(t+1)^2}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. But $(t-1)^2$ and $(t+1)^2$ are both nonnegative for all $t$, and are never simultaneously $0$, so their sum is always positive (and, specifically, nonzero). Therefore, the domain of $f(t)$ is all real numbers or, in interval notation, $\\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}$."
