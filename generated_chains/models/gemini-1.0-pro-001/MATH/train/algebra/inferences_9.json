At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\\$60,\\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?",
        "inference": "The formula for compound interest is given by:\n\n$$A = P\\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$$\n\nwhere $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal (initial investment), $r$ is the annual interest rate, $n$ is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded, and $t$ is the number of years.\n\nIn this problem, we have $A = 60000$, $r = 0.07$, $n = 4$ (since the interest is compounded quarterly), and $t = 5$.
