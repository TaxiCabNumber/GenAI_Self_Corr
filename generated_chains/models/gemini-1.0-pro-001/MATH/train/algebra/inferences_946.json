        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that we have an equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ whose graph is a parabola with vertex $(3,2)$, vertical axis of symmetry, and contains the point $(1,0)$.\n\nWhat is $(a, b, c)$?",
        "inference": "The vertex is the midpoint of the line segment that connects the two x-intercepts and it lies on the axis of symmetry.\nThe x-intercepts are (-1,0) and (7,0), so the axis of symmetry is $x=3$.\n\nTo find $(a, b, c)$, substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n$2=a(3)^2+b(3)+c$\n$\\Rightarrow 2 = 9a + 3b + c$\n\nSince the parabola has a vertical axis of symmetry, $b=0$. So,\n\n$2 = 9a + c$\n\nSubstituting the point $(1,0)$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$0 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c$\n$\\Rightarrow 0 = a + b + c$\n$\\Rightarrow c = -a-b$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $c$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$2 = 9a + (-a) = 8a$\n$\\Rightarrow a = 1/4$\n\nSubstituting $a=1/4$ into $c = -a$, we get: $c = -1/4$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b, c) = (\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}, \\boxed{0}, \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}})$.\n\nFinal Answer: $(a, b, c) = (\\frac{1}{4}, 0, -\\frac{1}{4})$.
