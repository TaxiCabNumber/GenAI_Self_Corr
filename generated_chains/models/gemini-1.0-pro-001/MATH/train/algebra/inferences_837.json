At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first four terms in an arithmetic sequence are $x+y$, $x-y$, $xy$, and $x/y$, in that order. What is the fifth term? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The common difference between the terms is $x+y-(x-y)=x+y-x+y=2y$. So the fifth term is $x/y+2y=\\boxed{\\frac{x+2y^2}{y}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{x+2y^2}{y}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the difference of the first two terms is $-2y$, the third and fourth terms of the sequence must be $x-3y$ and $x-5y$. Thus \\[\nx-3y = xy \\quad\\text{and}\\quad x-5y = \\frac{x}{y},\n\\]so $xy - 5y^{2} = x.$ Combining these equations we obtain \\[\n(x - 3y) - 5y^{2}= x\\quad\\text{and, therefore, }\\quad -3y - 5y^{2} = 0.\n\\]Since $y$ cannot be 0, we have $y = -\\frac{3}{5}$, and it follows that $x = -\\frac{9}{8}$. The fifth term in the sequence is $x - 7y\n= \\boxed{\\frac{123}{40}}$."
