At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let's shift the graph of $y=f(x)$ by $20$ units to the right. We get:\n\n$$y=f(x-20)$$\n\nSince this is identical to the original graph, we have:\n\n$$f(x)=f(x-20)$$\n\nNow, let's shift the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ by $a$ units to the right.

        "ground_truth": "The stated property of $f(x)$ can be written as an equation which holds for all $x$: $$f(x-20) = f(x).$$We are looking for the smallest positive $a$ such that the equation $$f\\left(\\frac{x-a}5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$$holds for all $x$. Rewriting this equation as $$f\\left(\\frac x5-\\frac a5\\right) = f\\left(\\frac x5\\right),$$we see that it is implied by the known property of $f(x)$ if $\\frac a5$ is equal to $20$ (or a multiple of $20$), or in other words, if $a$ is equal to $100$ (or a multiple of $100$). So, the smallest positive $a$ for which we know that this property holds is $a=\\boxed{100}$."
