At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2 - (1A)x + A0 = 0$ has positive integer solutions where $A$ is a positive  single digit. How many such $A$s exist? (Since $A$ is representing a digit, if $A = 2$ then   $A0$ represents the integer 20.)",
        "inference": "The equation is equivalent to $x^2 - (10 + A)x + 10A = 0$. For positive integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square, so $(10 + A)^2 - 4(10A) = D^2$ for some positive integer $D$. Simplifying, $100 + 20A + A^2 - 40A = D^2$, which simplifies to $A^2 - 20A + 60 = D^2$. Factoring, $(A - 10)^2 + 10 = D^2$. Since $D$ is a positive integer, $10 = D^2 - (A - 10)^2 = (D - A + 10)(D + A - 10)$. The only positive integer factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10, so we have four cases:\n\nCase 1: $D - A + 10 = 1$ and $D + A - 10 = 10$. Solving for $A$, we get $A = 0$, which is not a valid digit.\nCase 2: $D - A + 10 = 2$ and $D + A - 10 = 5$. Solving for $A$, we get $A = 3$.\nCase 3: $D - A + 10 = 5$ and $D + A - 10 = 2$. Solving for $A$, we get $A = 8$.\nCase 4: $D - A + 10 = 10$ and $D + A - 10 = 1$. Solving for $A$, we get $A = 19$, which is not a valid digit.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We need to find two numbers with a product of $A0$ and a sum of $1A$, where $A$ is a positive single digit. There are only 9 digits to try for $A$. Suppose we have a product of 10 and a sum of 11, then the two numbers could be 1 and 10. Suppose we have a product of 20 and a sum of 12, then the two numbers are 2 and 10. This will work for all values of $A$ from 1 to 9, so there are $\\boxed{9\\text{ values}}$ of $A$ that work."
