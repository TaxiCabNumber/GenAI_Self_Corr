        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 + 12x + 5$?",
        "inference": "The equation $y = x^2 + 12x + 5$ is a parabola. The vertex of a parabola occurs at the point (-b/2a, c - b^2/4a). \nIn this case, a = 1 and b = 12, so the vertex occurs at (-12/2(1), 5 - 12^2/4(1)) = (-6, -43). Therefore, the minimum possible value for $y$ is -43.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-43}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We complete the square on the right side by adding $(12/2)^2 = 36$ to both sides: $y+36 = x^2 + 12x + 36 + 5$, so $y+36 = (x+6)^2 + 5$, which gives $y = (x+6)^2 - 31$.  Since $(x+6)^2$ is nonnegative, and $(x+6)^2=0$ when $x=-6$, the smallest possible value of $y$ is $\\boxed{-31}$."
