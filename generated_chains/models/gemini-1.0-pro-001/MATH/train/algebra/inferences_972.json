        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe fifth term of an arithmetic sequence is $11$. If the difference between two consecutive terms is $1$, what is the product of the first two terms?",
        "inference": "Let the first term be $a$ and the common difference be $d$.\nThen, $a+4d = 11$ and $d = 1$.\nTherefore, $a = 11 - 4d = 11 - 4(1) = 7$.\nSo, the product of the first two terms is $a \\cdot (a+d) = 7 \\cdot (7+1) = \\boxed{56}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$."
