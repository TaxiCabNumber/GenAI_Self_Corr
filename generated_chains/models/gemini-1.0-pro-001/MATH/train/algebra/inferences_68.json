        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integers $n$ is it true that $\\sqrt{n} \\le \\sqrt{4n - 6} < \\sqrt{2n + 5}$?",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Squaring both sides of the left-hand inequality yields $n < 4n-6 \\Longrightarrow 6 \\le 3n \\Longrightarrow 2 \\le n$.\n\nSquaring both sides of the right-hand inequality yields $4n-6 < 2n+5 \\Longrightarrow 2n < 11 \\Longrightarrow n < 5.5$. Thus, $n$ must be one of $\\{2,3,4,5\\}$, of which we can check all work. As such, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$."
