At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes 15 men working steadily 4 days to dig the foundation for a new apartment.  How many days would it have taken 25 men working at the same rate to dig the foundation?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nIt takes 15 men 4 days to dig the foundation, so 1 man takes 15 * 4 = 60 days to dig the foundation.\n\nIf 25 men work at the same rate, then 1 man working at that rate takes 60 / 25 = 2.4 days to dig the foundation.\n\nTherefore, it takes 25 men working at that rate 2.4 days to dig the foundation.\n\n**Final Answer**:  $\\boxed{2.4}$.  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of men and the amount of time to dig the foundation are inversely proportional.  Let $m$ equal the number of men and $d$ equal the number of days to complete the foundation.  This implies that $md=k$ for some constant $k$.  From the given information, $15\\cdot 4=60=k$.  Knowing the value of $k$ we can solve for the number of days it would have have taken 25 men to dig the foundation: \\begin{align*}\n25\\cdot d&=60\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad d&=60/25=12/5=\\boxed{2.4}\n\\end{align*}"
