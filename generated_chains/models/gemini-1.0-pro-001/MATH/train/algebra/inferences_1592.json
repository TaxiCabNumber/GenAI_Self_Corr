        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf Alex gives Bob a penny, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has. How many pennies does Bob currently have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of pennies Alex has and $y$ be the number of pennies Bob has.\nFrom the first sentence, we have $y+1=3(x-1)$.\nFrom the second sentence, we have $y-1=2(x+1)$.\nSolving the first equation for $y$, we get $y=3x-4$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get $3x-4-1=2(x+1)$.\nSimplifying, we get $3x-5=2x+2$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=7$.\nSubstituting this back into $y=3x-4$, we get $y=3(7)-4=21$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the number of pennies that Alex currently has, and let $b$ be the number of pennies that Bob currently has. If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex will have $a - 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b + 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has, so $b + 1 = 3(a - 1) = 3a - 3$. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Alex will have $a + 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b - 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has, so $b - 1 = 2(a + 1) = 2a + 2$.\n\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we obtain $2 = a - 5$, so $a = 7$. Plugging this in, we can find that $b = 17$, so Bob has $\\boxed{17}$ pennies."
