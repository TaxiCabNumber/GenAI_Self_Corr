Without loss of generality, assume $a=b$. Substituting this into the first of our original equations, we obtain $a^2+c = ac+a \\Rightarrow a^2+c = a(c+1)=41$. Since $41$ is prime and $a$ and $c$ are positive integers, either $a=1$ or $a=41$. Note that if $a=41$, then $c+1 = 1 \\Rightarrow c=0$, a contradiction with the fact that $c$ is positive. Thus, $a=b=1 \\Rightarrow c+1=41 \\Rightarrow c=40$. Therefore $a+b+c = \\boxed{42}$"
