I hope it is correct.'\nThe domain of the equation $y = \\frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4}$ is the set of all real numbers with the exception of the values $x = A$ and $x = B$. What is $A + B$?",
        "inference": "The denominator of the fraction $\\frac{3x}{2x^2 - 6x + 4}$ is $2x^2 - 6x + 4 = 2(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 2(x - 1)(x - 2)$. Therefore, the denominator is equal to $0$ when $x = 1$ or $x = 2$. Thus, the domain of the equation is all real numbers except $x = 1$ and $x = 2$. Therefore, $A = 1$ and $B = 2$, so $A + B = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",

Factoring, $2(x-1)(x-2) = 0 \\Longrightarrow x = 1,2$. Hence, $A+B = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)"
