At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the squares of three consecutive positive integers is 7805. What is the sum of the cubes of the three original integers?",
        "inference": "Let x, x + 1, and x + 2 be the three consecutive positive integers.\nThen, we have x^2 + (x + 1)^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 7805.\nExpanding and simplifying, we get 3x^2 + 6x + 5 = 7805.\nSubtracting 7805 from both sides, we get 3x^2 + 6x - 7800 = 0.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get x^2 + 2x - 2600 = 0.\nFactoring, we get (x - 50)(x + 52) = 0.\nTherefore, x - 50 = 0 or x + 52 = 0.\nSolving each equation, we get x = 50 or x = -52.\nSince x is a positive integer, we must have x = 50.\nTherefore, the three original integers are 50, 51, and 52.\nThe sum of their cubes is 50^3 + 51^3 + 52^3 = 125,000 + 133,221 + 141,984 = \\\\boxed{399,205}.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{399,205}.

        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the middle of these integers, then we have $(n-1)^2+n^2+(n+1)^2 = 3n^2+2 = 7805$, or $n^2 = 2601$, meaning that $n=51$. Thus the sum of the cubes is $50^3+51^3+52^3 = \\boxed{398259}$."
