At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA non-square rectangle has integer dimensions. The number  of square units in its area is numerically equal to the number of units in its perimeter. What is the number of units in the perimeter of this rectangle?",
        "inference": "Let the rectangle have length \\( l \\) and width \\( w \\). \n\nSo, the area is \\( lw \\) and the perimeter is \\( 2l + 2w \\). \n\nSince the area is numerically equal to the perimeter, we have:\n\n$$lw = 2l + 2w$$\n\n$$ lw - 2l - 2w = 0$$\n\n$$l(w - 2) - 2(w - 2) = 0$$\n\n$$(l - 2)(w - 2) = 0$$\n\nSo, either \\( l - 2 = 0 \\) or \\( w - 2 = 0 \\). \n\nIf \\( l - 2 = 0 \\), then \\( l = 2 \\). \n\nIf \\( w - 2 = 0 \\), then \\( w = 2 \\). \n\nSo, the rectangle is a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square. \n\nThe perimeter of a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square is \\( 2(2 + 2) = 8 \\) units.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the two sides of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$.  The problem is now telling us $ab=2a+2b$.  Putting everything on one side of the equation, we have $ab-2a-2b=0.$  This looks tricky.  However, we can add a number to both sides of the equation to make it factor nicely.  4 works here:  $$ab-2a-2b+4=4 \\Rightarrow (a-2)(b-2)=4$$Since we don't have a square, $a$ and $b$ must be different.  It doesn't matter which one is which, so we can just say $a=6 $ and $b=3 $.  The perimeter is then $2(6+3)=\\boxed{18}$"
