At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree of the four vertices of a rectangle are $(5, 11)$, $(16, 11)$ and $(16, -2)$. What is the area of the intersection of this rectangular region and the region inside the graph of the equation $(x - 5)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9$? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "The rectangle has a length of $16-5=11$ and a height of $11-(-2)=13$. So, the area of the rectangle is $11\\cdot13=143$.\n\nThe circle has a radius of $3$, so its area is $\\pi\\cdot3^2=9\\pi$.\n\nThe intersection of the rectangle and the circle is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the parts of the rectangle that are outside the circle. The parts of the rectangle that are outside the circle are two quarter circles, each with a radius of $3$. So, the area of the intersection is $143-2\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}\\pi\\cdot3^2=143-9\\pi$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{143-9\\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sides of the rectangle are parallel to the axes, so the fourth point must make a vertical line with (5,11) and a horizontal one with (16,-2); this means that the fourth point is (5,-2). The graph of the region inside the equation is a circle with radius 3 and center (5,-2): [asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt));\n\nfill(Arc((5,-2),3,0,90)--(5,-2)--cycle,gray);\ndraw(Circle((5,-2),3));\ndraw((5,-2)--(16,-2)--(16,11)---(5,11)--cycle);\n[/asy] Since each angle of a rectangle is $90^{\\circ}$ and the corner coincides with the center of the circle, the rectangle covers exactly a quarter of the circle. The area of the intersection is thus $\\frac14r^2\\pi=\\frac14\\cdot3^2\\pi=\\boxed{\\frac94\\pi}$."
