Therefore, if the product of two numbers is less than or equal to $0$, then one of the numbers must be greater than or equal to $0$ and one of the numbers must be less than or equal to $0$.\n\nIf $(n+3)(n-7)\\le 0$, then because we know $n+3\\ge n-7$, we must specifically have $n+3\\ge 0$ and $n-7\\le 0$. The first condition, $n+3\\ge 0$, is true when $n\\ge -3$. The second condition, $n-7\\le 0$, is true when $n\\le 7$. Since both conditions must be true, the only solutions are the integers from $-3$ through $7$ (inclusive). These are $$n = -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.$$ Counting, we see that there are $\\boxed{11}$ solutions."
