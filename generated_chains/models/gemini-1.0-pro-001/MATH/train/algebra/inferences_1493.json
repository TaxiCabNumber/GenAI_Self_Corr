At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLuke is borrowing $\\$10{,}000$ from the bank. The bank offers him a choice between two $10$-year payment plans:\n\n${\\bf Plan~1.}$  Luke's debt accumulates $10\\%$ annual interest which compounds quarterly. Luke pays off half his balance after $5$ years, and the rest at the end of the $10$ years.\n\n${\\bf Plan~2.}$  Luke's debt accumulates $10\\%$ annual interest which compounds annually. Luke pays off his full balance at the end of the $10$ years.\n\nWhat is the (positive) difference between Luke's total payments under Plan 1 and his total payments under Plan 2? Round to the nearest dollar.",
