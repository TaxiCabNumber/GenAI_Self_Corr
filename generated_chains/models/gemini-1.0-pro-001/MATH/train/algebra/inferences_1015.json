At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex needs to borrow $\\$10,\\!000$ from the bank. The bank gives him two options.\n\n1. A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of $10\\%$ compounded quarterly, with the condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes.  The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance.\n\n2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\\%$, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years.\n\nFind the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes. Round your answer to the nearest dollar.",
