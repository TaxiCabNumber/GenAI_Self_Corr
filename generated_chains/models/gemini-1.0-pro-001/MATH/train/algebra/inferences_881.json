At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA freight train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds. At this rate, how many miles will the train travel in 1 hour?",
        "inference": "To find the speed of the train in miles per hour, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\n1 minute 30 seconds = 1.5 minutes = 1.5/60 hours = 0.025 hours\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1 mile / 0.025 hours = 40 miles per hour\n\nTo find the distance traveled in 1 hour, we simply multiply the speed by the time:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 40 miles per hour * 1 hour = 40 miles\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$40$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds. Then it will travel 2 miles in 3 minutes. Since 60 minutes contains 20 groups of 3 minutes, the train will travel $20 \\times 2 = \\boxed{40}$ miles in 1 hour."
