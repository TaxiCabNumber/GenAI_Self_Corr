At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlex has 12 friends and 63 coins. What is the minimum number of additional coins he needs so that he can give each friend at least one coin and no two friends receive the same number of coins?",

Determine the total number of coins Alex needs to give to his friends.\n\nTotal coins needed = Number of friends \u00d7 Minimum number of coins per friend\nTotal coins needed = 12 \u00d7 1\nTotal coins needed = 12\n\n2. Calculate the number of additional coins needed.\n\nAdditional coins needed = Total coins needed - Coins Alex already has\nAdditional coins needed = 12 - 63\nAdditional coins needed = -51\n\n3. Since Alex cannot have negative coins, he needs to add 51 more coins.\n\nAdditional coins needed = 51\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{51}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Alex wants to minimize the number of coins he gives to his friends without giving any two of them the same number of coins. The minimum number of coins he can give to a friend is 1. He then gives 2 coins to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 12. The total number of coins Alex has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 13}{2}=78$.  Thus, Alex needs $78-63=\\boxed{15}$ more coins."
