At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA motel bills its customers by charging a flat fee for the first night and then adding on a fixed amount for every night thereafter. If it costs George $\\$155$ to stay in the motel for 3 nights and Noah $\\$290$ to stay in the motel for 6 nights, how much is the flat fee for the first night?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the flat fee for the first night and $y$ be the fixed amount for every night thereafter.\n\nFor George, we have:\n\n$$x+2y=155$$\n\nFor Noah, we have:\n\n$$x+5y=290$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\n$$3y=135$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n\n$$y=45$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $y$ back into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$x+2(45)=155$$\n\n$$x+90=155$$\n\nSubtracting 90 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$x=65$$\n\nTherefore, the flat fee for the first night is $\\boxed{\\$65}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$65}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $f$ be the flat fee for the first night and $n$ be the fixed fee for each night thereafter. Notice that the first night is incorporated into the flat fee. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf + 2n &= 155 \\\\\nf + 5n &= 290 \\\\\n\\end{align*}It's easiest to eliminate $f,$ solve for $n$ and then solve for $f$ using that value. To solve for $n$, subtract the first equation from the second, obtaining $3n = 135$, or $n = 45$. Substitute for $n$ in the first equation to obtain $f = 155 - 90$, or $f = 65$. Thus, the flat fee for the first night is $\\boxed{\\$65}$."
