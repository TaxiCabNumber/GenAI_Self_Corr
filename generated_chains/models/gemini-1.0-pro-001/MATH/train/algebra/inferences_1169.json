At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary can mow a lawn in four hours and Tom can mow the lawn in 5 hours. If Tom works for 2 hours alone, what fractional part of the lawn remains to be mowed?",

Therefore, $\\frac{5}{5} - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$ of the lawn remains to be mowed.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{5}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If Tom can mow a lawn in $5$ hours, then in one hour, he can mow $1/5$ of the lawn. Since he mows for $2$ hours, he finished mowing $2 \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$ of the lawn. This leaves $1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ of the lawn left to be mowed."
