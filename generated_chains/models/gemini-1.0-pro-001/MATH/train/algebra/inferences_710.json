At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMurtha has decided to start a pebble collection. She collects one pebble the first day and two pebbles on the second day. On each subsequent day she collects one more pebble than the previous day. How many pebbles will she have collected at the end of the twelfth day?",
