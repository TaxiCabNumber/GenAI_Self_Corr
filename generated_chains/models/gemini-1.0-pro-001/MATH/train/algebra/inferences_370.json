At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $x$-intercept of the line perpendicular to the line defined by $3x-2y = 6$ and whose $y$-intercept is 2?",
        "inference": "**Solution**: \nThe equation of the line perpendicular to the given line can be written as \n$$2x+3y = c$$  for some constant $c$. \n\nSince the line passes through the point (0,2), it must satisfy the equation when $x=0$ and $y=2$. Therefore, the line passes through the point (0,2). Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get\n$$2(0) + 3(2) = c \\Rightarrow c=6.$$  \n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular line is \n$$2x+3y = 6$$ \n\nTo find the $x$-intercept of this line, we set $y=0$ in the equation and solve for $x$: \n$$2x + 3(0) = 6$$  \n$$\\Rightarrow 2x = 6$$  \n$$\\Rightarrow x = 3$$  \n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \\frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\\frac{2}{3} x + 2$.  We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \\boxed{3}$."
