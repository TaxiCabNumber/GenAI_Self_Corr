At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind $b$ if $\\log_{b}343=-\\frac{3}{2}$.",
        "inference": "1. Rewrite $343$ as a power of $b$: $343=b^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n2. Rewrite $b^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$ as a power of $\\frac{1}{b}$: $343=\\left ( \\frac{1}{b} \\right )^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n3. Equate the exponents: $\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n4. Therefore, $b=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Putting the equation in exponential form, we have $b^{-\\frac{3}{2}}=343$. Take the cube root of both sides (since $343=7^3$) to find $b^{-\\frac{1}{2}}=7$. Square both sides, to find $b^{-1}=7^2=49$. Thus $\\frac{1}{b}=49$ and $\\boxed{b=\\frac{1}{49}}$."
