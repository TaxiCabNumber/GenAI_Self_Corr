At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point $(4,3)$ by a $10$ foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin?",
        "inference": "The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is by going to the point $(14,3)$ or $(4,13)$.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the point $(14,3)$ is $\\sqrt{(14-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{196+9}=\\sqrt{205}=14.32$ feet.\n\nThe distance from the origin to the point $(4,13)$ is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(13-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+169}=\\sqrt{185}=13.60$ feet.\n\nThe greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is $14.32$ feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14.32}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$. The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=5$. As the radius of the circle is $10$, the distance from the origin to the point in the circle farthest from the origin is $\\boxed{15}$."
