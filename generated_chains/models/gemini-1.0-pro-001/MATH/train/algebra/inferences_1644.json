At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of a number $M$ and six less than $M$ is $-5$. What is the sum of all possible values of $M$?",
        "inference": "Let $x = M$. Then the product of $x$ and $x - 6$ is $-5$. So we have the equation:\n\n$$x(x - 6) = -5$$\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n$$x^2 - 6x = -5$$\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n$$x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we can solve for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{6^2 - 4(1)(5)}}{2(1)}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{24}}{2}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}}{2}$$\n\n$$x = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{6}$$\n\nSo the two possible values of $M$ are $M = 3 + \\sqrt{6}$ and $M = 3 - \\sqrt{6}$. The sum of these two values is:\n\n$$3 + \\sqrt{6} + 3 - \\sqrt{6} = 6$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Converting the given information to equational form, we find $M(M-6) = -5$.  Rearranging, $M^2 - 6M + 5 = 0$.  Using Vieta's equations for sum and product of roots, we find that the sum of the solutions to this equations is $-(-6) = \\boxed{6}$."
