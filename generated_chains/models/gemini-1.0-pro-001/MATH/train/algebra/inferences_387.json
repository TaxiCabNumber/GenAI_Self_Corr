At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular box has a volume of 108 cubic feet. How many cubic yards are in the volume of this box?",
        "inference": "1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet. \n\nSo, 1 cubic foot = (1/27) cubic yards. \n\nTherefore, 108 cubic feet = 108 * (1/27) cubic yards = 108/27 cubic yards\n\n$$= 4 cubic yards$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are 3 feet to a yard, there are $3^3=27$ cubic feet to a cubic yard. Thus, there are $108/27=\\boxed{4}$ cubic yards in the volume of the box."
