At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose the graph of $y=f(x)$ includes the points $(1,5),$ $(2,3),$ and $(3,1)$.\n\nBased only on this information, there are two points that must be on the graph of $y=f(f(x))$. If we call those points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d),$ what is $ab+cd$?",

Since $f(2)=3$, we have $c=3$. Thus,\n\n$$ab+cd=5f(5)+3f(3).$$\n\nSince $f(3)=1$, we have $ab+cd=5f(5)+3(1)=5f(5)+3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$5f(5)+3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $f(1)=5,$ $f(2)=3,$ and $f(3)=1$.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(2))=f(3)=1$ and $f(f(3))=f(1)=5$.\n\nThis tells us that the graph of $y=f(f(x))$ passes through $(2,1)$ and $(3,5)$, and the desired expression is $(2)(1)+(3)(5)=\\boxed{17}$."
