At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMargo walks to her friend's house in 10 minutes. Using the same route, it takes Margo 20 minutes to get back home. If her average walking rate for the entire trip is 4 miles per hour, how many total miles did she walk?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the total distance Margo walked.\n\n**Step 1:** Determine the average speed for the entire trip\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n4 = x / (10 + 20)\n4 = x / 30\nx = 4 * 30\nx = 120 miles\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$120$}.

        "ground_truth": "Margo walked for a total of $10+20=30$ minutes, or 0.5 hours.  To find the total distance traveled, we can multiply the total time by the rate: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{distance}&=\\text{rate}\\times \\text{time} \\\\\n&=0.5\\times 4 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{2}\\text{ miles}.\n\\end{align*}"
