At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe and JoAnn each bought 12 ounces of coffee in a 16-ounce  cup. Joe drank 2 ounces  of his coffee and then added 2 ounces  of cream. JoAnn added 2 ounces  of cream, stirred the coffee well, and then drank 2 ounces. What is the resulting ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee? Express your answer as a fraction.",

Since 14 ounces is the total amount of liquid, and Joe drank 2 ounces, he has 14 - 2 = 12 ounces of liquid left in his cup.\n\n**Step 2: Find the amount of coffee and cream in JoAnn's cup.**\n\nJoAnn started with 12 ounces of coffee and added 2 ounces of cream, so she now has 12 + 2 = 14 ounces of liquid in her cup.

        "ground_truth": "Joe has 2 ounces  of cream in his cup. JoAnn has drunk 2 ounces  of the 14 ounces  of coffee-cream mixture in her cup, so she has only $12/14 = 6/7$ of her 2 ounces  of cream in her cup. Therefore the ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee is \\[\n\\frac{2}{\\frac{6}{7}\\cdot2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{6}}.\n\\]"
