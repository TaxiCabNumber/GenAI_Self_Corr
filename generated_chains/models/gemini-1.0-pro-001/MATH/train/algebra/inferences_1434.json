At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The sum of all the integers between -12.1 and 3.3 can be found by summing the arithmetic series from -12 to 3. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:\n\n$$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, $n = 3 - (-12) + 1 = 16$, $a_1 = -12$, and $a_n = 3$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{16}{2}(-12 + 3) = 8(-9) = -72$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-72}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The problem is asking for the sum of the integers from $-12$ to 3.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of integers from $-12$ to 3 is $3 - (-12) + 1 = 16$, so the sum is $(-12 + 3)/2 \\cdot 16 = \\boxed{-72}$."
