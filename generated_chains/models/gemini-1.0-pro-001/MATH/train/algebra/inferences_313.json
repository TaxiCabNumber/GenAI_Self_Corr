        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the slope of the line determined by any two solutions to the equation $\\frac{2}{x}+\\frac{3}{y} = 0$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Solving the given equation for $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{y} = -\\frac{2}{x} \\Rightarrow y = -\\frac{3x}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, for any two solutions $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ to the given equation, we have:\n\n$$y_1 = -\\frac{3x_1}{2} \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad y_2 = -\\frac{3x_2}{2}$$\n\nThus, the slope of the line determined by these two points is:\n\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-\\frac{3x_2}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{3x_1}{2}\\right)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{-\\frac{3}{2}(x_2 - x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can quickly see that we can get a solution to the equation if the first fraction is 1 and the second is -1 which gives $(x, y) = (2, -3)$.  Similarly if we let $(x, y) = (-2, 3)$ we get the first fraction to be $-1$ and the second to be 1.  The slope of the line through these two points is $\\frac{-3 - 3}{2 - (-2)} = \\boxed{- \\frac 32}$."
