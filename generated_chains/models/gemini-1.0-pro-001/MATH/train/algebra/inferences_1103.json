        "ground_truth": "By inspection, upon expanding the terms of the product $(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)(x^4 - 3x + 2)$, the only term that has a degree of $3$ will be the term found by multiplying together the three linear terms. Thus, the desired coefficient is the coefficient is $(-3)(-3)(-3)=\\boxed{-27}$."
