At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe domain of a function is the set of all values of the independent variable for which the function is defined. For the function $$j(x) = \\frac{1}{x+8} + \\frac{1}{x^2+8} + \\frac{1}{x^3+8}~$$, the function is undefined whenever the denominator of any of the fractions is zero. Therefore, the domain of the function is the set of all values of $x$ such that $x+8 \\ne 0$, $x^2+8 \\ne 0$, and $x^3+8 \\ne 0$. These conditions are equivalent to $x \\ne -8$, $x \\ne \\pm 2i$, and $x \\ne -2$. Therefore, the domain of the function is the set of all real numbers except for $-8$, $-2$, and $\\pm 2i$. In interval notation, this can be written as\n$$\\boxed{ \\text{Domain} = (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty) }$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{ \\text{Domain} = (-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, -2) \\cup (-2, 2) \\cup (2, \\infty) }.

        "ground_truth": "We note that $j(x)$ is defined unless one or more of the denominators $x+8,~x^2+8,~x^3+8$ is equal to $0$.\n\nWe have $x+8=0$ if $x=-8$, and $x^3+8$ if $x=\\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2$. There is no real $x$ for which $x^2+8=0$. Therefore, the domain of $j(x)$ consists of all real $x$ except $-8$ and $-2$. As a union of intervals, this is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (-8,-2)\\cup (-2,\\infty)}$."
