        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pen and its ink refill together cost $\\;\\$1.10$. The pen costs $\\;\\$1$ more than the ink refill. What is the cost of the pen in dollars?",
        "inference": "Let the cost of the ink refill be $x$ dollars.\nThen the cost of the pen is $x + 1$ dollars.\nWe know that the cost of the pen and the ink refill together is $1.10, so:\n$$x + (x + 1) = 1.10$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 2x + 1 = 1.10$$\n$$\\Rightarrow  2x = 1.10 - 1$$\n$$\\Rightarrow  2x = 0.10$$\n$$\\Rightarrow  x = 0.10/2$$\n$$\\Rightarrow  x = 0.05$$\nTherefore, the cost of the ink refill is $0.05, and the cost of the pen is $0.05 + 1 = $1.05.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.05}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Begin by assigning variables.  Let $p$=the cost of the pen and $i$=the cost of the ink.  From what we are given,\n\\begin{align*}\np+i&=1.10,\\\\\np&=1+i.\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $p$ in the first equation, we find: $1+i+i=1.10$, so $2i=.10$ and $i=.05$. Therefore, $p=1+i=\\boxed{1.05}$ dollars."
