At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x)=\\frac{x+4}{x^2+ax+b}$, and $f(x)$ has two vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=-2$, find the sum of $a$ and $b$.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $f(x)$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=1$, the denominator $x^2+ax+b$ must be equal to zero when $x=1$. Therefore, we have $1^2+a(1)+b=0$, which gives $a+b=-1$.\nSince $f(x)$ has a vertical asymptote at $x=-2$, the denominator $x^2+ax+b$ must be equal to zero when $x=-2$. Therefore, we have $(-2)^2+a(-2)+b=0$, which gives $4-2a+b=0$, or $2a-b=4$.\nAdding the two equations, we get $a+b=-1+2a-b=4$, so $a=5$ and $b=-6$.\nTherefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $5+(-6)=\\boxed{-1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that a rational function will have vertical asymptotes at values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is undefined. Additionally, we know that $f(x)$ is undefined when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero. Since there are vertical asymptotes at $x=1$ and $x=-2$, the function must be undefined at these two values. Therefore, $(x-1)(x+2)=x^2+ax+b=0 \\Rightarrow x^2+x-2=x^2+ax+b$. So $a=1$ and $b=-2$, and $a+b=1+(-2)=\\boxed{-1}$."
