At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe midpoint of a line segment is located at $(1, -2)$. If one of the endpoints is $(4, 5)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
        "inference": "Let $(x, y)$ be the other endpoint. The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})$. So, we have:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{4 + x}{2}, \\frac{5 + y}{2}\\right) = (1, -2)$$\n\nSolving for $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{4 + x}{2} = 1 \\Rightarrow x = -2$$\n\n$$\\frac{5 + y}{2} = -2 \\Rightarrow y = -9$$\n\nTherefore, the other endpoint is $\\boxed{(-2, -9)}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-2, -9)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the midpoint are the averages of the $x$-coordinates and $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, respectively.  Since $4-3=1$, the $x$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $1-3=-2$.  Since $5-7=-2$, the $y$-coordinate of the other endpoint is $-2-7=-9$.  Therefore, the endpoints are $(4,5)$ and $\\boxed{(-2,-9)}$."
