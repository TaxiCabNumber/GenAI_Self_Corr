At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat number can be added to both the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{3}{5}$ so that the resulting fraction will be equivalent to $\\frac{5}{6}$?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number to be added. So, \\(\\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \\frac{5}{6}\\). By cross-multiplication we have,\n$$6(3+x) = 5(5+x)$$\nSimplifying it: \n$$18+6x = 25+5x$$\nCombining like terms:\n$$6x-5x = 25-18$$\nSimplifying: \n$$x = \\frac{7}{1}$$\n$$x = 7$$\n**Final Answer: \\[\\boxed{7}\\].**",
        "ground_truth": "We seek the number $n$ such that $\\frac{3+n}{5+n} = \\frac{5}{6}$.  Multiplying both sides by $5+n$ and by 6 gives $(3+n)(6) = 5(5+n)$.  Expanding both sides gives $18 + 6n = 25 + 5n$.  Simplifying this equation gives $n = \\boxed{7}$."
