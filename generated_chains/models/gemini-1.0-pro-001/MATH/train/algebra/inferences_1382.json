        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree $4$ and $5$ respectively.  What is the degree of $f(x^3) \\cdot g(x^2)$?",
        "inference": "The degree of $f(x^3)$ is $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$.\nThe degree of $g(x^2)$ is $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$.\nTherefore, the degree of $f(x^3) \\cdot g(x^2)$ is $12 + 10 = \\boxed{22}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $4$, its highest degree term is of the form $ax^4$.  Substituting $x^3$ for $x$ shows that the highest degree term is $a(x^3)^4 = ax^{12}$, which means that $f(x^3)$ has degree $12$.  Similarly, $g(x^2)$ has degree $10$.  Since the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the two polynomials, the degree of $f(x^3) \\cdot g(x^2)$ is $12+10=\\boxed{22}$."
