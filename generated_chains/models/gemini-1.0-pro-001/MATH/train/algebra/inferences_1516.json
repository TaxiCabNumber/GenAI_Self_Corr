        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy $x^2-y^2=51$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\n$$x^2-y^2=51\\\\ (x+y)(x-y)=51$$\nSince both factors are positive integers, the only possible pairs of factors are $(1,51)$ and $(3,17)$. Hence, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Factoring, we have $(x+y)(x-y)=51$.  Since $x,y$ are positive, we have $x+y>x-y>0$.  Note that $51=51*1=17*3$.  Thus either $x+y=51$, $x-y=1$ or $x+y=17$, $x-y=3$.  Solving in the first case gives $x=26,y=25$, and the second case gives $x=10,y=7$.  Thus there are $\\boxed{2}$ pairs $(x,y)$ that solve the equation."
