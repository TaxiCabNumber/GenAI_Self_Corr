        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA lattice point in the $x,y$-plane is a point both of whose coordinates are integers (not necessarily positive).  How many lattice points lie on the graph of the equation $x^2-y^2=47$?",
        "inference": "Since $x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)$, we have\n\n$$x+y=\\pm1, \\pm7, \\pm47 \\text{ and } x-y=\\pm1, \\pm7, \\pm47.$$\n\nConsidering the six possible values of $x+y$, we can solve for $y$ and get six corresponding values for $x$.  Solving $x-y=\\pm1$ gives $y=x\\pm1$.  This gives six more values for $x$.  Repeating this for each of the six values of $x-y$ gives a total of 36 values for $x$.  By symmetry, we get the same number of values for $y$.  So there are $36\\cdot36=\\boxed{1296}$ lattice points on the graph of $x^2-y^2=47$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1296}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Applying the difference of squares factorization, we see that any such point satisfies $(x+y)(x-y)=47$.  Both factors are integers.  The only pairs of factors of $47$ are $(47,1)$ and $(-47,-1)$. Thus we have that the coordinates satisfy one of the following four systems: (i) $x+y=47$, $x-y=1$; (ii)  $x+y=-47$, $x-y=-1$; (iii) $x+y=1$, $x-y=47$; (iv) $x+y=-1$, $x-y=-47$.  Solving each of these $4$ systems individually gives exactly one solution in each integers for each system.  Thus there are $\\boxed{4}$ lattice points on the graph."
