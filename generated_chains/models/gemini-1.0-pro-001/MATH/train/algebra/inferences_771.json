        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$, how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?",
        "inference": "Since $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$, we know that $14<\\sqrt{x}\\le 15$. Squaring both sides, we get $196<x\\le 225$. The only integer values of $x$ in this range are $x=196, x=225$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the expression $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil$ stands for the least integer that is greater than or equal to $x$, the largest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $15^2$, or $225$. The greatest integer smaller than $15$ is $14$, so the largest integer (smaller than $225$) that would not satisfy $\\lceil{\\sqrt{x}}\\rceil=15$ would be $14^2$, or $196$. Therefore, any integer that is in the range $196 < x \\leq 225$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$. Since there are 29 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\\boxed{29}$."
