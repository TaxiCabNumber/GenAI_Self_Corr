At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSusie Q has 1000 dollars to invest.  She invests some of the money at the Pretty Penny Bank, which compounds annually at 3 percent.  She invests the rest of the money at the Five and Dime Bank, which compounds annually at 5 percent.  After two years, Susie has a total of $\\$1090.02$.  How much did Susie Q originally invest at the Pretty Penny Bank, in dollars?",
