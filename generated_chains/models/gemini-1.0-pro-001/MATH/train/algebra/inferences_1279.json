At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoint $A$ is at $(0, 0)$ and point $B$ is on the line $y = 4$. The slope of segment $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$. What is the sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$?",
        "inference": "The slope of segment $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$. This means that for every $3$ units we move to the right, we move $2$ units up. If $B$ is on the line $y = 4$, then its $y$-coordinate is $4$. This means that we have moved $4$ units up from point $A$. To find the change in $x$, we divide $4$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$: $\\frac{4}{\\frac{2}{3}} = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of point $B$ is $0 + 6 = 6$. The sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$ is $6 + 4 = \\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$.  We know the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\\boxed{10}$."
