        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLauren solved the equation $|x-5| = 2$. Meanwhile Jane solved an equation of the form $x^2+ bx + c = 0$ that had the same two solutions for $x$ as Lauren's equation. What is the ordered pair $(b, c)$?",
        "inference": "The solutions to the equation $|x-5| = 2$ are $x = 3$ and $x = 7$. Therefore, the solutions to Jane's equation must be $x = 3$ and $x = 7$. We can use Vieta's formulas to find the values of $b$ and $c$.\n\nVieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation $x^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of the roots is $-b$ and the product of the roots is $c$. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n3 + 7 &= -b\\\\\n3 \\cdot 7 &= c\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSolving the first equation gives $b = -10$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $c = 21$. Therefore, the ordered pair $(b, c) = (\\boxed{-10, 21})$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-10, 21)}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To start, we solve Lauren's equation.  If $x-5$ is positive, then: $$|x-5|=x-5=2$$ $$x=7$$ On the other hand, if $x-5$ is negative, then: $$|x-5|=5-x=2$$ $$x=3$$ Jane's quadratic equation must have roots of 7 and 3.  In factored form , this quadratic will look like: $$(x-3)(x-7)=0$$ Expanding, we find Jane's equation is: $$x^2-10x+21=0$$ The ordered pair is $\\boxed{(-10,21)}$."
