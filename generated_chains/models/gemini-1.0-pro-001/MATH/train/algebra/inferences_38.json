        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has three sides of the following side lengths: $7$, $10$, and $x^2$. What are all of the positive integer values of $x$ such that the triangle exists? Separate your answers using commas and express them in increasing order.",
        "inference": "To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Therefore, we have the following inequalities: $7+10>x^2$, $7+x^2>10$, and $10+x^2>7$. Solving these inequalities, we get $x^2<17$, $x^2>-3$, and $x^2>-3$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, the only possible value of $x$ is $4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \\to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \\to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \\to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$. Therefore, possible values for $x$ are $\\boxed{2, 3, \\text{ and } 4}$."
