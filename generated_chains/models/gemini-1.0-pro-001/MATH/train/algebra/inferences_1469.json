        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo parabolas are the graphs of the equations $y=3x^2+4x-5$ and $y=x^2+11$. Give all points where they intersect. List the points in order of increasing $x$-coordinate, separated by semicolons.",
        "inference": "1. Set the two equations equal to each other.\n$$3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$$\n2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.\n$$2x^2+4x-16=0$$\n$$x^2+2x-8=0$$\n$$(x+4)(x-2)=0$$\n3. The two points of intersection are:\n$$x=-4 \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad x=2$$\n4. Substitute each value of $x$ back into either original equation to find the corresponding $y$-coordinate.\n$$y=3(-4)^2+4(-4)-5=-43$$\n$$y=(2)^2+11=15$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-4, -43); (2, 15)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Setting the right-hand sides of the given equations equal gives $3x^2+4x-5=x^2+11$. Combining like terms gives $2x^2+4x=16$. Dividing by $2$ gives $x^2+2x=8$, and rearranging gives $x^2 +2x - 8=0$.  Factoring gives $(x+4)(x-2)=0$, so our solutions are $x=-4$ and $x=2$.  Substituting these into either of the original equations to find the corresponding values of $y$, we find the points of intersection to be $\\boxed{(-4, 27);(2, 15)}$."
