        "inference": "To find the largest value of $c$ such that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)=x^2-5x+c$, we need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$. The minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex, which is located at $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=-5$, so the vertex is located at $x=-\\frac{-5}{2(1)}=\\frac{5}{2}$. The corresponding value of $f(x)$ is $f\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2-5\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)+c=\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{25}{2}+c=\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{50}{4}+c=\\frac{25}{4}-\\frac{50}{4}+c=\\frac{-25}{4}+c$.\n\nSince $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$, we have $\\frac{-25}{4}+c\\leq1$. Solving for $c$, we get $c\\leq1+\\frac{25}{4}=\\frac{29}{4}$. Therefore, the largest value of $c$ such that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{29}{4}}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{29}{4}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We see that 1 is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2 - 5x + c = 1$ has a real root.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-5)^2 - 4(c - 1) = 29 - 4c$.  The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $29 - 4c \\ge 0$.  Then $c \\le 29/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{29}{4}}$."
