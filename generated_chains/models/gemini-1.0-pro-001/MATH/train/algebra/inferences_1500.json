At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a school bus leaves school with 48 students on board, and one-half of the students get off the bus at each of the first three stops, how many students remain on the bus after the third stop?",
        "inference": "- At the first stop, half of the students get off the bus, so $48 \\div 2 = 24$ students remain.\n\n\n- At the second stop, half of the remaining students get off the bus, so $24 \\div 2 = 12$ students remain.\n\n\n- At the third stop, half of the remaining students get off the bus, so $12 \\div 2 = 6$ students remain.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At each stop, the number of students on the bus is cut in half. Therefore, after 3 stops, the number of students on the bus is $48(\\frac12)^3 = \\frac{48}8 = \\boxed{6}$."
