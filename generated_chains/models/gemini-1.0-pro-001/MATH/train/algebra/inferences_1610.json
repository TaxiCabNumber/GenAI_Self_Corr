At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI randomly pick an integer $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive. What is the probability that I choose a $p$ such that there exists an integer $q$ so that $p$ and $q$ satisfy the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$ can be rewritten as $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$. Factoring the left side gives $(p - 2)(q - 4) = 10$. The only factors of $10$ that have a difference of $2$ are $2$ and $5$, so the only possible values of $p$ and $q$ are $p = 2$ and $q = 6$, or $p = 7$ and $q = 2$. Therefore, there are two possible pairs of integers $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the equation, and there are $10$ possible values of $p$. So the probability is $\\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We approach this problem by trying to find solutions to the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$. To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$. This can be factored into $$(p-2)(q-4)=10$$  We now can see that there are solutions only if $p-2$ divides $10$. Thus, there are $4$ possible values of $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive $(1,3,4 \\text{ and } 7)$. It follows that the probability of picking such a $p$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
