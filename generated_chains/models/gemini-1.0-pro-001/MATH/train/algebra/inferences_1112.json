        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nParticipation in the local soccer league is $10\\%$ higher this year than it was last year. Also, from last year to this year, the number of males increased by $5\\%$ and the number of females increased by $20\\%$. There were $20$ males participating in the league last year. What fraction of the league's participants is female this year? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of females participating last year.\n\nThere were $20$ males participating last year, so the total number of participants last year was $x+20$.\n\nParticipation is $10\\\\%$ higher this year than it was last year, so the number of participants this year is $1.1(x+20) = 1.1x + 22$.\n\nThe number of males increased by $5\\\\%$, so the number of males this year is $1.05(20) = 21$.\n\nThe number of females increased by $20\\\\%$, so the number of females this year is $1.20x$.\n\nThe fraction of the league's participants that is female this year is $\\frac{1.20x}{1.1x + 22}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{12x}{11x + 22}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there were $20$ males last year, there are $1.05 \\cdot 20 =21$ males this year.\n\nWe set the number of females last year as $x$. This means that there are $1.2x$ females this year.\n\nIn total, there were $20+x$ people in the league last year, and $1.1 \\cdot (20+x)$ this year. We then have: \\begin{align*}\n22+1.1x &= 21+1.2x \\\\\n1 &= 0.1x \\\\\nx &= 10.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, there were $10$ girls last year. This means there are $1.2 \\cdot 10 =12$ girls this year. So there are $\\frac{12}{12+21}=\\frac{12}{33}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{11}}$ girls out of the participants this year."
