        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSolve for $x$: $\\frac{3x - 1}{4x-4} = \\frac23$.",
        "inference": "$$\\frac{3x - 1}{4x-4} = \\frac23$$ $$\\Rightarrow 3(3x - 1) = 2(4x-4)$$ $$\\Rightarrow 9x - 3 = 8x-8$$ $$\\Rightarrow 9x - 8x = -3+8$$ $$\\Rightarrow x = 5$$ Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides by $4x-4$ and by 3 gives $3(3x-1) = 2(4x-4)$.  Expanding the products on both sides gives $9x-3 = 8x - 8$.  Subtracting $8x$ from both sides $x -3 = -8$ and adding 3 to both sides gives $x = \\boxed{-5}$."
