At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe difference between two positive integers is 6 and their product is 112. What is the sum of the integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two integers be \\(x\\) and \\(x + 6\\).\nThen, we have the system of equations:\n$$\\begin{align}\nx + 6 - x &= 6 \\\\\nx(x + 6) &= 112\n\\end{align}$$\nFrom the first equation, we have \\(x = 6\\). Substituting this into the second equation, we have\n$$\\begin{align}\n6(6 + 6) &= 112 \\\\\n6(12) &= 112 \\\\\n72 &= 112\n\\end{align}$$\nwhich is false. Therefore, there is no solution to the system of equations.\nFinal Answer: The sum of the integers is undefined.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $x$ and $y$, with $x>y$. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\nx-y&=6\\\\\nxy&=112\n\\end{align*}Squaring the first equation, we get  \\[(x-y)^2=6^2\\Rightarrow x^2-2xy+y^2=36\\]Multiplying the second equation by four, we get $4xy = 4\\cdot112=448$. Adding these last two equations, we have \\[x^2-2xy+y^2+4xy=36+448 \\Rightarrow (x+y)^2=484 \\Rightarrow x+y = 22\\]In the last step, we take the positive square root because both $x$ and $y$ are given to be positive. The sum of the two integers is $\\boxed{22}$."
