At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nXanthia can read 100 pages per hour and Molly can read 50 pages per hour. If they each read the same book, and the book has 225 pages, how many more minutes than Xanthia would it take for Molly to finish reading the book?",
        "inference": "**Solution of the final problem:**\n\n* Xanthia can read 100 pages per hour, which is equal to 100/60 pages per minute.\n* Molly can read 50 pages per hour, which is equal to 50/60 pages per minute.\n* Xanthia will take 225 pages / (100/60 pages per minute) = 135 minutes to finish reading the book.\n* Molly will take 225 pages / (50/60 pages per minute) = 270 minutes to finish reading the book.\n* The difference between the two times is 270 minutes - 135 minutes = 135 minutes.\n* Therefore, Molly will take 135 more minutes than Xanthia to finish reading the book.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{135}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Reading the book takes Xanthia\n\n$\\frac{225}{100}=2.25$ hours.\n\nIt takes Molly\n\n$\\frac{225}{50}=4.5$ hours.\n\nThe difference is $2.25$ hours, or $2.25(60)=\\boxed{135}$ minutes."
