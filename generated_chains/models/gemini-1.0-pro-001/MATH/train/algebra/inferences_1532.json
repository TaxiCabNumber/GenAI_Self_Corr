At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMackenzie bought 142 feet of fencing with which to enclose her rectangular garden. If the numbers of feet in the lengths of the garden's sides are natural numbers, what is the maximum number of square feet that can be enclosed by the fencing?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of the garden is \\(142\\) feet. So the sum of the lengths of the garden's \\(4\\) sides is \\(142\\) feet. Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be the dimensions of the garden. We have\n\n$$2x+2y=142\\Rightarrow x+y=71$$\n\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are natural numbers, the maximum value of \\(x+y=71\\) is when \\(x=35\\) and \\(y=36\\).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1260}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 142, the sides of the rectangle add up to $142/2 = 71.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $71 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(71 - x) = 71x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 71x = -x^2 + 71x - \\frac{71^2}{2^2} + \\frac{71^2}{2^2} = \\frac{5041}{4} - \\left( x - \\frac{71}{2} \\right)^2.\\]To minimize this, we want $x$ as close as possible to $\\frac{71}{2}.$  Normally, we could take $x = \\frac{71}{2},$ but $x$ must be an integer, so we can take $x$ as either 35 or 36.\n\nThus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $35 \\cdot 36 = \\boxed{1260}.$"
