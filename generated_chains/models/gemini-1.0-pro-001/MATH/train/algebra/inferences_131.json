        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAfter traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the charge for traveling 70 miles.\n$$\\frac{120}{50} = \\frac{x}{70} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\frac{120}{50} \\cdot 70 = 168.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$168$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ equal the cost of a 70 mile taxi ride. Since we know that Ann was charged $120 dollars a 50 mile taxi ride, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{120}{50}=\\frac{d}{70}$. If we solve for $d$ by multiplying both sides by 70, we find that $d=\\left(\\frac{120}{50}\\right)(70)=\\boxed{168}$ dollars."
