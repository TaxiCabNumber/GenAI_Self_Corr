At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFour people can paint a house in six hours. How many hours would it take three people to paint the same house, assuming everyone works at the same rate?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the total amount of work required to paint the house.\n\nHours required by 4 people = 6 hours\nTotal work = 4 people x 6 hours = 24 person-hours\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the average work rate per person.\n\nWork rate per person = Total work / Number of people\n= 24 person-hours / 4 people = 6 person-hours/hour\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the number of hours required by three people.\n\nHours required by 3 people = Total work / Work rate per person\n= 24 person-hours / 6 person-hours/hour\n= 4 hours\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number of people painting the house and the amount of time it takes are inversely proportional. This means that if we let $n$ be the number of people, and $t$ be the time taken, the product $nt$ is a constant. Since 4 people can paint the house in 6 hours, $nt=(4)(6)=24$. Therefore, if three people were painting the same house, $nt=3t=24$, and $t=\\boxed{8}$."
