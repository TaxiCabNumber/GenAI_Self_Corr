At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHomewood Middle School has 1200 students, and 730 of these students attend a summer picnic. If two-thirds of the girls in the school and one-half of the boys in the school attend the picnic, how many girls attend the picnic?  (Assume that each student in the school is either a boy or a girl.)",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of girls in the school.\n\nThe number of boys in the school = 1200 - x\n\nThe number of girls at the picnic = 2x/3\n\nThe number of boys at the picnic = (1200 - x)/2\n\nThe number of students at the picnic = 730\n\n2x/3 + (1200 - x)/2 = 730\n\n4x/6 + 3(1200 - x)/6 = 730(6)/6\n\n4x/6 + 3600/6 - 3x/6 = 4380/6\n\nx/6 + 3600/6 = 4380/6\n\nx + 3600 = 4380\n\nx = 4380 - 3600\n\nx = 780\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{780}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of girls at HMS be $g$ and the number of boys be $b$. Thus, the total number of students implies $g + b = 1200$ and the attendance figures imply $\\frac{2}{3} g + \\frac{1}{2} b = 730$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting that from the second equation multiplied by 6, we get $g = 780$. And, the number of girls who attended the picnic is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 780 = \\boxed{520}$."
