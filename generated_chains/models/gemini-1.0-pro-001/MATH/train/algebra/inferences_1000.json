        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular room measures 12-feet by 6-feet. How many square yards of carpet are needed to cover the floor of the room?",
        "inference": "1. Convert feet to yards: 12 feet = 12/3 = 4 yards, 6 feet = 6/3 = 2 yards\n2. Calculate the area of the room: Area = length x width = 4 yards x 2 yards = 8 square yards\n3. Round up to the nearest whole number: 8 square yards rounded up to the nearest whole number is 8 square yards\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the room is $(12\\text{ ft.}) (6\\text{ ft.})=72$ square feet.  Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, 1 square yard equals 9 square feet.  Therefore, $72/9=\\boxed{8}$ square yards are needed to cover the floor."
