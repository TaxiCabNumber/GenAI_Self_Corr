At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+12x=73$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can rewrite the equation as \\begin{align*}\nx^2+12x-73&=0\\\\\n(x+13)(x-5)&=0\\\\\nx=-13,5\n\\end{align*}\nWe have $\\sqrt{a}-b=5$, so $a=25$ and $b=5$. Therefore, $a+b=25+5=\\boxed{30}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we add $(12/2)^2=36$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+12x+36=109 \\Rightarrow (x+6)^2=109$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+6=\\sqrt{109}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{109}-6$. Thus, $a=109$ and $b=6$, so $a+b=\\boxed{115}$."
