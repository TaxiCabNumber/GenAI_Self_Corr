At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+32t+15$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum height. The vertex occurs at $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the $t^2$ term and $b$ is the coefficient of the $t$ term. In this case, $a=-16$ and $b=32$.\n\n$$t = -\\frac{32}{2(-16)} = 1$$\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute $t = 1$ back into the equation to find the maximum height.\n\n$$h = -16(1)^2 + 32(1) + 15 = -16 + 32 + 15 = 31$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{31}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+32t+15$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+32t+15=-16(t^2-2t)+15\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-2/2)^2=1$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-2t)+15&=-16(t^2-2t+1-1)+15\\\\\n&=-16([t-1]^2-1)+15\\\\\n&=-16(t-1)^2+31\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-1)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-1)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+31=\\boxed{31}$ feet."
