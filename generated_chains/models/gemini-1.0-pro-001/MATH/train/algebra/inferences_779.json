        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe cost of five pencils and one pen is $\\$2.50$, and the cost of one pencil and two pens is $\\$1.85$. What is the cost of two pencils and one pen?",
        "inference": "Let the cost of one pencil be $x$ and the cost of one pen be $y$.\nFrom the first given information, we have:\n$$5x+y=2.50\\Rightarrow 5x=2.50-y\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{2.50-y}{5}$$\n\nFrom the second given information, we have:\n$$x+2y=1.85\\Rightarrow x=1.85-2y$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $x$, we have:\n$$\\frac{2.50-y}{5}=1.85-2y$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $5$, we get:\n$$2.50-y=9.25-10y$$\n\nSolving for $y$, we get:\n$$-9y=-6.75\\Rightarrow y=0.75$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $y$ into the equation $x=\\frac{2.50-y}{5}$, we get:\n$$x=\\frac{2.50-0.75}{5}=\\frac{1.75}{5}=0.35$$\n\nTherefore, the cost of two pencils and one pen is $2x+y=2(0.35)+0.75=\\boxed{\\$1.45}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\$1.45}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the cost of one pencil be $a$ and the cost of one pen be $b$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. The equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n5a + b &= 2.5 \\\\\na + 2b &= 1.85 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe are trying to find the value of $2a + b$. Notice that when we add the two equations, we get $6a+3b=4.35$. This is just three times what we are looking for, so dividing both sides of this last equation by three, we get that $2a+b=1.45$. Thus, the cost of two pencils and one pen is $\\boxed{1.45}$ dollars.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve our system of equations for $a$ and $b$ and then find the value of $2a+b$. In this case, we get that $a=.35$ and $b=.75$, so $2a+b=1.45$, as expected."
