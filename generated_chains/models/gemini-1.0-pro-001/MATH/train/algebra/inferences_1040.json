He can't read the coefficient of $x$, but he knows that the equation has two distinct negative, integer solutions.

        "inference": "Since there are distinct, negative integer solutions, the equation must be of the form $$x^2+bx+c=0,$$ where $c>0$ and $b$ is negative and odd.

        "ground_truth": "Because the quadratic has two distinct integer roots, we know that it can be factored as  \\[(x+r)(x+s),\\] where $r$ and $s$ are positive integers.  Expanding this product gives  $x^2 + (r+s)x + rs$, and comparing this to the given quadratic tells us that $rs = 36$.  So, we consider all the pairs of distinct integers that multiply to 36, and we compute their sum in each case: \\[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\nr&s&r+s\\\\\\hline\n1&36&37\\\\\n2&18&20\\\\\n3&12&15\\\\\n4&9&13\\end{array}\\] Summing the entries in the final column gives us a total of $\\boxed{85}$."
