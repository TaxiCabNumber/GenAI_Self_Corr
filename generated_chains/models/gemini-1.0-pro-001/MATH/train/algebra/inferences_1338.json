I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular box has a volume of $4320$ cubic inches and a surface area of $1704$ square inches. The sum of the lengths of its $12$ edges is $208$ inches. What would be the volume of the box, in cubic inches, if its length, width and height were each increased by one inch?",
        "inference": "First, we can find the sum of the length, width and height of the rectangular box by dividing the sum of its edges by $4$. \n$$\\frac{208}{4}=52$$\n\nSo, $l+w+h=52$.\n\nNext, we know that the volume of a rectangular box is given by $V=lwh$. Since the volume is $4320$ cubic inches, we have $lwh=4320$.\n\nWe can use the sum of the length, width and height to solve for one of the variables. Solving for $h$, we get $h=52-l-w$. Substituting this into the volume equation, we get $V=lw(52-l-w)=52lw-lw^2-l^2w$.\n\nNow, we can solve for $l$ or $w$ by differentiating the volume equation with respect to $l$ or $w$ and setting it equal to zero. \n$$\\frac{dV}{dl}=52w-2lw-w^2=0$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dw}=52l-2lw-l^2=0$$\n\nSolving these equations, we get $l=12$ inches and $w=28$ inches. Since $h=52-l-w$, we have $h=12$ inches.\n\nTherefore, the original volume of the rectangular box is $V=lwh=(12)(28)(12)=\\boxed{4032}$ cubic inches.\n\nIf the length, width and height are each increased by one inch, the new volume of the box is \n$$V=(l+1)(w+1)(h+1)=(13)(29)(13)=\\boxed{4559}$$ cubic inches.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4559}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We label the length $l$, the width $w$, and the height $h$. We are given that $l \\cdot w \\cdot h =4320$, thus we have that $2lw+2wh+2hl = 1704$ and $lw+wh+hl = 852.$ Also, $4l+4w+4h=208,$ so $l+w+h=52$.\n\nWe want to find what the volume will be if we increase all of the sides by an inch. So we have, \\begin{align*}\n(l+1)(w+1)(h+1)&=lwh+lh+wh+lw+w+l+h+1\\\\\n&=4320+852+52+1\\\\\n&=\\boxed{5225 \\text{ cubic inches}}.\n\\end{align*}"
