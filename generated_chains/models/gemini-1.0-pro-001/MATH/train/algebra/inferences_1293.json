At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $a > 0$, if $f(g(a)) = 8$, where $f(x) = x^2 + 8$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 4$, what is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "We have $f(g(a)) = 8$. Substituting $g(a)$ with $a^2 - 4$, we get $f(a^2 - 4) = 8$. Substituting $f(x)$ with $x^2 + 8$, we get $(a^2 - 4)^2 + 8 = 8$. Expanding the square and simplifying, we get $a^4 - 8a^2 = 0$. Factoring, we get $a^2(a^2 - 8) = 0$. This gives us $a^2 = 0$ or $a^2 = 8$. Since $a > 0$, we have $a^2 = 8$. Therefore, $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
