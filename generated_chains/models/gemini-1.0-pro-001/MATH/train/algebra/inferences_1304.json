At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $P(n)$ and $S(n)$ denote the product and the sum, respectively, of the digits of the integer $n$. For example, $P(23) = 6$ and $S(23) = 5$. Suppose $N$ is a two-digit number such that $N = P(N) +\nS(N)$. What is the units digit of $N$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nSince $N$ is a two-digit number, we can write $N = 10a + b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit.\n\nThen, we have $$P(N) = a \\cdot b, \\qquad S(N) = a + b.$$ Thus, $$N = P(N) + S(N) \\Rightarrow 10a + b = a \\cdot b + a + b \\Rightarrow 9a = a \\cdot b.$$ Since $a$ and $b$ are both digits, the only possible solution is $a = 9$ and $b = 1$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose $N=10a+b$. Then $10a+b=ab+(a+b)$. It follows that $9a=ab$, which implies that $b=9$, since $a \\neq 0$. So the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
