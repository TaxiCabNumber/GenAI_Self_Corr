At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJune and Julia live 1 mile apart. It takes June 4 minutes to ride her bike directly to Julia's house. At the same rate, how many minutes would it take June to ride the 3.5 miles from her own house to Bernard's house?",
        "inference": "Let $t$ be the time it takes June to ride 3.5 miles. Then, since she is riding at the same rate as before, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{3.5\\text{ miles}}{t\\text{ minutes}}=\\frac{1\\text{ mile}}{4\\text{ minutes}}$$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$$3.5t=4$$\n\nDividing both sides by 3.5, we get:\n\n$$t=\\frac{4}{3.5}\\approx 1.14\\text{ minutes}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{1.14}$$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since it takes June 4 minutes to travel 1 mile, it takes her $4\\times3.5=\\boxed{14}$ minutes to travel 3.5 miles."
