I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has the following properties: (1) The maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$. (2) The graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$. If the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, then what is the value of $m$?",
        "inference": "From (1), we have $a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 5$.\nFrom (2), we have $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = -13$.\nCombining these equations, we get $a(9) + 3b + c = 5$ and $c = -13$.\nSubstituting $c = -13$ into the first equation, we get $a(9) + 3b = 18$.\nWe are given that the graph passes through the point $(4,m)$, so we have $a(4)^2 + b(4) + c = m$.\nSubstituting $c = -13$ and $a(9) + 3b = 18$ into this equation, we get $a(16) + b(4) - 13 = m$.\nSimplifying, we get $4a + b = m + 13$.\nSubstituting $a(9) + 3b = 18$ into this equation, we get $36a + 12b = 54 + 39$.\nSimplifying, we get $3a + b = 3$.\nSolving this equation for $b$, we get $b = 3 - 3a$.\nSubstituting this expression for $b$ into the equation $4a + b = m + 13$, we get $4a + 3 - 3a = m + 13$.\nSimplifying, we get $a + 3 = m + 13$.\nSolving this equation for $m$, we get $m = a + 10$.\nSubstituting $a(9) + 3b = 18$ into this equation, we get $m = 18 + 10 = 28$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since the maximum value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is 5, which occurs at $x = 3$, this tells us that the vertex of the parabola is $(3,5)$.  Hence, the quadratic is of the form $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, where $a$ is a negative number.  (We know that $a$ is negative because $y$ has a maximum value.)\n\nWe are also told that the graph passes through the point $(0,-13)$.  Substituting these coordinates into the equation $y = a(x - 3)^2 + 5$, we get $-13 = 9a + 5$, so $a = (-5 - 13)/9 = -18/9 = -2$.  Therefore, the equation is $y =- 2(x - 3)^2+5$.\n\nWhen $x = 4$, we have $m = - 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 5 = \\boxed{3}$."
