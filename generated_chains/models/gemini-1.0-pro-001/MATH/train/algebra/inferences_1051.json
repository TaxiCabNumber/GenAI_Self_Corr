        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLisa has 10 friends and 34 marbles. What is the minimum number of additional marbles she needs so that she can give each friend at least one marble and no two friends receive the same number of marbles?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFirst, we must ensure that Lisa has enough marbles to give each friend at least one. 10 friends requires 10 marbles at minimum. Since she has 34 marbles, she has enough marbles to meet this requirement.\n\nNext, we must consider the problem of ensuring that no two friends receive the same number of marbles. The minimum number of additional marbles needed for this is the difference between the number of friends and the greatest integer that can be evenly divided by the number of friends.\n\nIn this case, the number of friends is 10 and the greatest integer that can be evenly divided by 10 is 9 (10 x 9 = 90). Therefore, the minimum number of additional marbles needed is 10 - 9 = 1.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Lisa wants to minimize the number of marbles she gives to her friends without giving any two of them the same number of marbles. The minimum number of marbles she can give to a friend is 1. She then gives 2 marbles to another friend, then 3 to another, then 4, and so on, until the last friend receives 10. The total number of marbles Lisa has given away is $1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2}=55$.\n\nThus, Lisa needs $55-34=\\boxed{21}$ more marbles."
