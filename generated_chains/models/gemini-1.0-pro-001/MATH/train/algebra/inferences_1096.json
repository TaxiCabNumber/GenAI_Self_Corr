At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $c$ is a constant such that $x^2+100x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial, then what is $c$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe can write $x^2+100x+c$ as\n\n$$(x+a)^2=x^2+2ax+a^2$$\n\nComparing coefficients, we get \n$$2a=100\\Rightarrow a=50$$\n\nand $a^2=c\\Rightarrow c=50^2=\\boxed{2500}.$\n**Final Answer: $2500$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $x^2+100x+c$ is the square of a binomial, then because the coefficient of $x^2$ is $1$, the binomial must be of the form $x+a$ for some $a$.\n\nExpanding, we have $(x+a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$. For this to be equal to $x^2+100x+c$, the coefficients of $x$ must agree, so $2a$ must be equal to $100$. This gives $a=50$, and so the constant term $a^2$ is $\\boxed{2500}$."
