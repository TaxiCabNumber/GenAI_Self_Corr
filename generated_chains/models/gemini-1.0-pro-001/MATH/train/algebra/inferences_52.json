At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $45$. Their difference is $3$. What is the lesser of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.\nGiven that $x + y = 45$, we have $x = 45 - y$.\nAlso, given that $x - y = 3$, we have $x = y + 3$.\nEquating the two expressions for $x$, we get $45 - y = y + 3$.\nSolving for $y$, we get $y = 21$.\nSubstituting $y = 21$ into $x = 45 - y$, we get $x = 45 - 21 = 24$.\nTherefore, the lesser of the two numbers is $\\boxed{21}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$. Thus: $y=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\\boxed{21}$."
