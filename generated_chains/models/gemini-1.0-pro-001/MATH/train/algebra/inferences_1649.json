        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+ ax = -14$ has only integer solutions for $x$. If $a$ is a positive integer, what is the greatest possible value of $a$?",
        "inference": "The equation can be rewritten as $x^2 + ax + \\frac{a^2}{4} = -14 + \\frac{a^2}{4}$. This is a perfect square if and only if $-14 + \\frac{a^2}{4}$ is a perfect square. The greatest perfect square less than or equal to 14 is 12, so $-14 + \\frac{a^2}{4} = 12$. Thus, $\\frac{a^2}{4} = 26$, so $a^2 = 104$. The only positive integer $a$ such that $a^2 = 104$ is $a = 10$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The left-hand side factors into $x(x+a)=-14$, so $x$ and $x+a$ both divide $-14$. One of the two factors is negative and the other positive, since their product is negative. $x+a>x$, so $x+a>0$ and $x<0$. This leaves 4 possibilities for $x$, since it is negative and divides $-14$ evenly: $-1$, $-2$, $-7$, and $-14$. $x=-1$ gives $x+a=14$ and therefore $a=15$. Similarly, $x=-2$, $x=-7$, and $x=-14$ give $a=9$, $a=9$, and $a=15$, respectively. The largest value for $a$ is thus $\\boxed{15}$."
