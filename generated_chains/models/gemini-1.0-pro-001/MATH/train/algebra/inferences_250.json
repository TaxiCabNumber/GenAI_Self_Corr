At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJoe is studying a bacteria population.  There are 20 bacteria present at 3:00 p.m. and the population doubles every 3 minutes.  Assuming none of the bacteria die, how many bacteria are present at 3:15 p.m. the same day?",
        "inference": "The population doubles every 3 minutes. So, after 3 minutes, the population becomes \\(20\\times2\\), After another 3 minutes, the population becomes \\((20\\times2)\\times2\\). After another 3 minutes, the population becomes $((20\\times2)\\times2)\\times2\\).\nSince there are 5 intervals of 3 minutes between 3:00 p.m. and 3:15 p.m., the population at 3:15 p.m. is \n$$20\\times2\\times2\\times2\\times2=20\\times32=640$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$640$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are five 3-minute increments between 3:00 pm and 3:15 pm, so the bacteria doubles 5 times, so the final population is $2^5 = 32$ times the initial population.  Hence at 3:15 pm there are $20 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{640}$ bacteria."
