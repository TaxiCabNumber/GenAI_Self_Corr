At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the beginning of my bike ride I feel good, so I can travel   20 miles per hour.  Later, I get tired and travel only 12 miles  per hour.  If I travel a total of 122 miles in a total time of   8 hours, for how many hours did I feel good?  Express your  answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let **x** be the number of hours I felt good.\n\nThen, I traveled **20x** miles while feeling good and **12(8-x)** miles while tired for a total of **20x + 12(8-x) = 122** miles.\n\nSolving for **x**,\n\n**20x + 96 - 12x = 122**\n\n**8x = 26**\n\n**x = 26/8 = 3.25**\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{3.25}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ equal the number of hours that you felt good riding.  Then, $x$ hours were spent traveling at 20 mph, and $8-x$ hours were spent traveling at 12 mph.  During this time, a total of 122 miles was traveled.  Remembering that $d=r\\cdot t$, we can add the two distances, set this equal to 122 miles, and solve for $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n20(x)+12(8-x)&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 20x+96-12x&=122\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 8x&=26\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=26/8=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{4}}\n\\end{align*}"
