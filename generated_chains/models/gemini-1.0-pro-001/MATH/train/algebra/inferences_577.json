At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a hot day, Megan likes to eat a Popsicle every 15 minutes. Assuming she keeps up that rate of consumption, how many Popsicles can Megan finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 4 hours and 30 minutes to minutes:\n\n4 hours = 240 minutes\n\nTotal minutes = 240 + 30 = 270 minutes\n\n\n2. Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 270 minutes:\n\n270 minutes \u00f7 15 minutes/interval = 18 intervals\n\n\n3. Multiply the number of intervals by the number of Popsicles consumed per interval:\n\n18 intervals * 1 Popsicle/interval = 18 Popsicles\n\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $p$ be the number of Popsicles Megan can finish in 4 hours and 30 minutes. If we convert that period of time into minutes, we find that 4 hours and 30 minutes is equal to $(4)(60)+30=270$ minutes. From here, we can set up the proportion  \\begin{align*} \\frac{x}{270}& =\\frac{1}{15}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\left(\\frac{1}{15}\\right)(270)\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x& =\\boxed{18}\n\\end{align*}"
