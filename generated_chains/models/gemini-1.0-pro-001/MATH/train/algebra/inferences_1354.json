For the equation to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. \n\nLet $b$ be an integer such that $b^2 = a^2 - 32a$. Then $a^2 - 32a = b^2$ and $a(a - 32) = b^2$. Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $a$ must be a factor of $b^2$. The only factors of $b^2$ are $1, b, b^2, -1, -b,$ and $-b^2$. Since $a$ is positive, it must be one of the factors $1, b, b^2$.\n\nIf $a = 1$, then $b^2 = 1 - 32 = -31$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nIf $a = b$, then $a^2 - 32a = a^2 = b^2$, which is a perfect square.\n\nIf $a = b^2$, then $a^2 - 32a = a^2 - 32a^2 = -31a^2$, which is not a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the only integer value of $a$ for which the equation has integer solutions is $a = \\boxed{b}$.
