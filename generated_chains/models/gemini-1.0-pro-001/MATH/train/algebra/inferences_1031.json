At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a party, Ted's age is 15 years less than twice Sally's age. The sum of their ages is 54. How old is Ted?",
        "inference": "Let Sally's age be x.\nThen, Ted's age = 2x - 15\nSum of their ages = x + (2x - 15) = 3x - 15 = 54\n3x = 69\nx = 23\nTed's age = 2x - 15 = 2(23) - 15 = 46 - 15 = 31\n**Final Answer: $31$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let Ted's age be $t$ and Sally's age be $s$. We are trying to find the value of $t$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nt &= 2s - 15 \\\\\nt + s &= 54 \\\\\n\\end{align*}The first equation represents the statement ``Ted's age is 15 years less than twice Sally's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``The sum of their ages is 54.'' We are solving for $t$, so we want to eliminate $s$. From the second equation, we get that $s=54-t$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $s$, we have $t=2(54-t)-15$, from which we get that $t=31$. Thus, Ted's age is $\\boxed{31}$ years old."
