At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZachary paid for a $\\$1$ burger with 32 coins and received no change. Each coin was either a penny or a nickel. What was the number of nickels Zachary used?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the number of pennies by $x$ and the number of nickels by $y$. We have the following system of equations:\n\n$$x + y = 32$$\n$$1x + 5y = 100$$\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = 32 - y$$\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$1(32 - y) + 5y = 100$$\n$$32 - y + 5y = 100$$\n$$4y = 68$$\n$$y = 17$$\n\nTherefore, the number of nickels Zachary used is $\\boxed{17}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $p$ is the number of pennies and $n$ is the number of nickels that Zachary used, then we are given \\begin{align*}\np+n&=32\\text{, and} \\\\\np+5n&=100.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second, we find $4n=68$ which implies $n=\\boxed{17}$."
