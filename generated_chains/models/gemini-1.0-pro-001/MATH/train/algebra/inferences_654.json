        "inference": "**Step 1**: Let's assume x is the first even integer. Thus, the second and third even integer will be x + 2 and x + 4, respectively.\n\n**Step 2**: As given that the sum of the first and third integers is $128$, so we can write the equation:\n```\nx + x + 4 = 128\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Now, let's simplify the equation:\n```\n2x + 4 = 128\n```\n\n**Step 4**: Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:\n```\n2x = 128 - 4\n```\n\n**Step 5**: Dividing both sides by 2:\n```\nx = (128 - 4)/2\n```\n\n**Step 6**: Calculating the value of x:\n```\nx = 124/2\n```\n\n```\nx = 62\n```\n\nTherefore, the first even integer is $62$. So, the other two even integers are $64$ and $66$.\n\n**Step 7**: Now, let's find the sum of the three consecutive even integers:\n```\nSum = 62 + 64 + 66\n```\n\n```\nSum = 192\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$192$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of an arithmetic sequence equals the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the average of the first and last term is $\\frac{a_1+a_3}{2}=\\frac{128}{2}=64$ and the number of terms is 3. We multiply to get $64\\cdot3=\\boxed{192}$."
