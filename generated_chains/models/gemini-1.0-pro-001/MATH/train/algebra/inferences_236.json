At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes four painters working at the same rate $1.25$ work-days to finish a job. If only three painters are available, how many work-days will it take them to finish the job, working at the same rate? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "If it takes 4 painters 1.25 work-days to finish a job, then 1 painter would take 4 * 1.25 = 5 work-days to finish the job.\nIf only 3 painters are available, then it would take 5 / 3 = 1 2/3 work-days to finish the job.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1\\frac23}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of workers will be inversely proportional to the time needed to complete the job.  This means that the product $(\\text{number of workers})\\times(\\text{days to complete job})$ will be a constant.  In this case, that constant will be: $$4\\times 1.25=5$$ For three workers, the product will remain the same.  Let $D$ equal the number of days needed for three workers to complete the job.  Then, \\begin{align*}\n3\\times D&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad D&=5/3=\\boxed{1\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{work-days}.\n\\end{align*}"
