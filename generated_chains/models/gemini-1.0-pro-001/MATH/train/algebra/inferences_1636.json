I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a car's brakes are applied, it travels 7 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 28 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",

The formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\\).\n\nWe want to find the number of terms \\(n\\). We know that the car travels 0 feet in the last term, so \\(a_n = 0\\). We also know that the car travels 28 feet in the first second, so \\(a_1 = 28\\). Substituting these values into the formula for \\(S_n\\), we get:\n\n$$28 = \\frac{n}{2}(28 + 0)$$\n\n$$28 = \\frac{n}{2}(28)$$\n\n$$28 = 14n$$\n\n$$n = 2$$\n\nNow that we know \\(n\\), we can substitute it into the formula for \\(S_n\\) to find the total distance traveled by the car:\n\n$$S_2 = \\frac{2}{2}(28 + 0)$$\n\n$$S_2 = 28$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{28}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 28 and common difference $-7$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $28+21+14+7 = \\boxed{70}$."
