At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the interval of all $x$ such that both $2x$ and $3x$ are in the interval $(1,2)$.",
        "inference": "If $2x$ is in the interval $(1,2)$, then $1 < 2x < 2$. Dividing all sides by $2$, we get $\\frac{1}{2} < x < 1$.\n\nIf $3x$ is in the interval $(1,2)$, then $1 < 3x < 2$. Dividing all sides by $3$, we get $\\frac{1}{3} < x < \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the interval of all $x$ such that both $2x$ and $3x$ are in the interval $(1,2)$ is the intersection of the intervals $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right)$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\right)$.
