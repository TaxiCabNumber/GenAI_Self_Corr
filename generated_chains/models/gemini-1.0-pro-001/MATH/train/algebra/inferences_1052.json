I hope it is correct.'\nA math field day competition is held in a room with many tables, and there are 6 stools at each table. Each stool has 3 legs, and each table has 4 legs. If there is a total of 484 legs on all the tables and stools in the room, how many tables are in the room?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of legs on the tables.**\n\nThere are 4 legs per table. Let's represent the number of tables as \"t\". Therefore, the total number of legs on the tables is:\n\nLegs on tables = 4 * t\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of legs on the stools.**\n\nThere are 3 legs per stool and 6 stools per table. Therefore, the total number of legs on the stools is:\n\nLegs on stools = 3 * 6 * t\n               = 18 * t\n\n**Step 3: Add the legs on the tables and stools to get the total number of legs.**\n\nTotal legs = Legs on tables + Legs on stools\n              = 4 * t + 18 * t\n              = 22 * t\n\n**Step 4: Set the total legs equal to 484.**\n\nWe know that the total number of legs is 484. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n22 * t = 484\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the number of tables \"t\".**\n\nDivide both sides of the equation by 22:\n\nt = 484 / 22\nt = 22\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{22}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the number of stools in the room and $t$ be the number of tables. We are looking for the value of $t$. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information, as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= 6t \\\\\n3s + 4t &= 484 \\\\\n\\end{align*}To solve for $t$, we need to eliminate $s$ from the equations above. Substitute the first equation into the second to eliminate $s$, to get $3(6t)+4t=484$, or $t=22$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{22}$ tables in the room."
