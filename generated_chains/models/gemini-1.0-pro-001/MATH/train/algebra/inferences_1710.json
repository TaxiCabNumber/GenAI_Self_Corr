I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $f$ and $g$ are polynomials, and that $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$.  Find the degree of $g(x)$ given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $6$ and the degree of $f(x)$ is $2$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is at most the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$. Thus, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is at most $2\\cdot\\text{degree}(g)$.\n\n**Step 2:** The degree of the sum $h(x)=f(g(x))+g(x)$ is at most the maximum of the degrees of its terms. Thus, the degree of $h(x)$ is at most $\\max\\{2\\cdot\\text{degree}(g),\\text{degree}(g)\\}=\\text{degree}(g)$.\n\n**Step 3:** It is given that the degree of $h(x)$ is $6$. Thus, the degree of $g(x)$ must be at least $6$. However, we cannot determine the exact degree of $g(x)$ without more information about the polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{The degree of $g(x)$ is at least $6$. However, it cannot be determined exactly without more information.}**",
        "ground_truth": "$f(g(x))$ must have a degree of 6, because it will produce the term with the greatest exponent of the polynomial. Because $f(x)$ is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write that $f(x)=bx^2+cx+d$. The term with the greatest exponent in $f(g(x))$ comes from taking $bx^2$ or $b(g(x))^2$. Let $g(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_0$. Then, the highest degree term of $f(g(x))$ is $b(a_nx^n)^2$, which equals $ba_{n}^2x^{2n}$. Since the degree of $h$ is 6, we have $2n=6$, so $n=3$.  Therefore, the degree of $g$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
