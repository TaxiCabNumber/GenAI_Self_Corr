        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor=6$, how many possible integer values of $x$ are there?",
        "inference": "Since $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor=6$, then $6\\le\\sqrt{x}<7$. Squaring both sides, we have $36\\le x<49$. The only integer values of $x$ in this range are $37,38,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,$ and $48$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible integer values of $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the expression $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor$ stands for the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$, the smallest possible value of $x$ that could satisfy the equation is $6^2$, or $36$. The next integer greater than $6$ is $7$, so the smallest integer (greater than $36$) that would not satisfy $\\lfloor{\\sqrt{x}}\\rfloor=6$ must be $7^2$, or $49$. Therefore, any integer that is in the range $36\\le{x}<49$ could be considered a possible integer value of $x$. Since there are 13 numbers in this range, our final solution is $\\boxed{13}$."
