        "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that the solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ has a rational square root. Therefore, the solutions of $kx^2+20x+k=0$ are rational if and only if $400-4(k)(k)$ is a perfect square.

By writing the discriminant as $4(100-k^2)$, we see that we only need to check the integers $1\\leq k\\leq 10$.  Of these, $\\boxed{6, 8\\text{, and }10}$ work."
