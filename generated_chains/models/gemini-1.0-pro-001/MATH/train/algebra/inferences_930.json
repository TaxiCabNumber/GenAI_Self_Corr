        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a jumbo bag of bows, $\\frac{1}{5}$ are red, $\\frac{1}{2}$ are blue, $\\frac{1}{10}$ are green and the remaining 30 are white. How many of the bows are green?",
        "inference": "Let the total number of bows be $x$.\nThen, the number of red bows = $\\frac{1}{5}x$\nThe number of blue bows = $\\frac{1}{2}x$\nThe number of green bows = $\\frac{1}{10}x$\nThe number of white bows = 30\nWe know that the total number of bows is the sum of the number of bows of each color\nTherefore, \n$$x = \\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{10}x+30$$\n$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{x}{10} = 30$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x = 30 \\cdot 10 = 300$$\nTherefore, the number of green bows = $\\frac{1}{10}x = \\frac{1}{10} * 300 = \\boxed{30}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We add up the fractions of non-red bows and get $\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{2+5+1}{10}=\\frac{8}{10}=\\frac{4}{5}$. So the 30 bows make up $1-\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ of the total bows, and the total number of bows is $5\\times30=150$. The green bows are $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the total, and $\\frac{1}{10}\\times150=15$, so there are $\\boxed{15}$ green bows."
