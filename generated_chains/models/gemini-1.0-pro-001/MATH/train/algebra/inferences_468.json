        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct $x$-intercepts does the graph of $y = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$ have?",
        "inference": "Factor the quadratic factor:\n\n$$y = (x-5)(x+2)(x+3)$$\n\nBy the Zero-Product Property, the graph has $x$-intercepts at $x=5$, $x=-2$, and $x=-3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "An $x$-intercept occurs when $y=0$.  So, the $x$-intercepts are the solutions to the equation $0 = (x-5)(x^2+5x+6)$.  From this equation, we see that solutions occur when $x-5=0$ and when $x^2+5x+6=0$.  Now, $x^2+5x+6$ factors to $(x+3)(x+2)$.  So, the solutions are $5, -2, -3$, which comes to $\\boxed{3}$ intercepts."
