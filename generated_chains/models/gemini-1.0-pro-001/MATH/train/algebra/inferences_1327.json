        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangle having integer length and width has a perimeter of 100 units. What is the number of square units in the least possible area?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$ is $P=2l+2w$. Since the perimeter is 100, we have $2l+2w=100$. Dividing both sides by 2 gives $l+w=50$.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is $A=lw$. We want to find the smallest possible area, so we want to find the smallest possible values of $l$ and $w$ that satisfy the equation $l+w=50$.\n\nSince $l$ and $w$ are integers, the smallest possible values of $l$ and $w$ that satisfy the equation $l+w=50$ are $l=24$ and $w=26$. Therefore, the least possible area is $A=lw=24\\cdot26=\\boxed{624}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{624}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A rectangle with fixed perimeter has minimal area when one dimension is as long as possible and the other is as short as possible. To see this, let $x$ be the shorter dimension and $y$ the area of the rectangle, and note that $y=x(50-x)$. The graph of $y=x(50-x)$ is a down-turned parabola with vertex at $(25,625)$, and thus is as small as possible when $x$ is as small as possible. Since $x$ is an integer, its minimum value is 1. Thus the relevant rectangle with minimum area is 1 by 49.  Its area is $49\\cdot 1=\\boxed{49}$ square units."
