I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2-kx-12=0$ has only integer solutions for certain positive integers $k$. What is the sum of all such values of $k$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the equation has only integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square.  Thus, we have $k^2+48=m^2$ for some integer $m$.  Since $k$ is positive, $m>k$.  Solving for $m$, we have $m=\\sqrt{k^2+48}$.  Since $m$ is an integer, $k^2+48$ must be a perfect square.  The next perfect square greater than $48$ is $64$.  Thus, $k^2+48=64$, and so $k=4$.  Therefore, the sum of all such values of $k$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
