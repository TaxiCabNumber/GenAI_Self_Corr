At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what real value of $b$ is the expression $\\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b - 3$ minimized?",
        "inference": "The expression $\\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b - 3$ is a parabola. The parabola opens upwards since the coefficient of $b^2$ is positive. The vertex of the parabola is at $b = -5$. Since the parabola opens upwards, the vertex is the minimum point. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b - 3$ is minimized when $b = -5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{b = -5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b - 3 & = (\\frac{1}{2}b^2 + 5b) - 3\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(b^2 + 10b + 25) - 3 -25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}(b + 5)^2 - \\frac{31}{2}.\n\\end{align*} The minimum value of $\\frac{1}{2}(b + 5)^2$ is $0$, since the square of a real number is never negative. Thus, the minimum value of the expression occurs at $b = \\boxed{-5}$."
