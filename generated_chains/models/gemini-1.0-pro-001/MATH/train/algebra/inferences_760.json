I hope it is correct.'\nThe side of a square has the length $(x-2)$, while a rectangle has a length of $(x-3)$ and a width of $(x+4)$. If the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the square, what is the sum of the possible values of $x$?",

Since the area of the rectangle is twice the area of the square, we have:\n\n$$(x-3)(x+4) = 2(x-2)^2$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$$x^2 + x - 12 = 2x^2 - 8x + 8$$\n\nSubtracting $2x^2$ and $x$ from both sides:\n\n$$-x^2 + 9x - 20 = 0$$\n\nFactoring:\n\n$$-(x-4)(x-5) = 0$$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $x$ are $x = 4$ and $x = 5$.
