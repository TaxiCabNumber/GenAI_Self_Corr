        "ground_truth": "After two years, at a four percent annual interest rate, the Jose's investment will have grown to $50000 \\cdot 1.04^2 = 54080$.  Patricia has the same annual interest rate, but compounded quarterly, so each quarter (or each period of three months), her investment is compounded at the rate of $4/4 = 1$ percent.  In two years, there are eight quarters, so Patricia's investment will have grown to $50000 \\cdot 1.01^8 = 54143$, to the nearest dollar.  The difference is then $54143 - 54080 = \\boxed{63}$."
