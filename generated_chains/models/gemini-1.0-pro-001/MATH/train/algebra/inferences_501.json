At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since $(1,2)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f(x)}2$, we know that $$2 = \\frac{f(1)}{2},$$which implies that $f(1)=4$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(4)=1$, which implies that $\\left(4,\\frac12\\right)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac{f^{-1}(x)}{2}$. The sum of this point's coordinates is $\\boxed{\\frac 92}$."
