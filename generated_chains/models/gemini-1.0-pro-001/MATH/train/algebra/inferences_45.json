        "inference": "The equation of a line with slope $m$ and passing through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ is given by $$y-y_1 = m(x-x_1).$$ Here, the slope is $m=-7$ and the point is $(3,0)$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $$y-0 = -7(x-3)$$ $$\\Rightarrow y = -7x+21$$ $$\\Rightarrow y=-7x+21$$ Comparing this with the standard form $y = mx+b$, we get $m=-7$ and $b=21$. \n\nTherefore, $m+b=-7+21=\\boxed{14}.$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{14}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-7(3)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-21+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21&=b\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\\boxed{14}$."
