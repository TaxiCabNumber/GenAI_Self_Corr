At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor two real values of $n$, the equation $4x^2+nx+25=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$. What is the positive value of $n$?",
        "inference": "The equation $4x^2+nx+25=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$ if and only if its discriminant is equal to zero. The discriminant is given by $n^2-4(4)(25)=-375$, so we need $n^2=-375$.  Since $n$ is a real number, the positive value of $n$ is $|n|=\\sqrt{-375}=15\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15\\sqrt{5}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A quadratic has exactly one distinct solution when its discriminant is 0.  The discriminant of $4x^2 + nx + 25$ is $n^2 - 4(4)(25)$.  Setting this equal to 0 gives $n^2 - 400 = 0$, so $n^2 = 400$.  The positive solution of this equation is $n = \\boxed{20}$."
