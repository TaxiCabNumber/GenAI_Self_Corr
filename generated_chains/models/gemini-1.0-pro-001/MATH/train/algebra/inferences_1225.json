        "inference": "$$(x+4)(x+1) = m + 2x$$ \n$$\\Rightarrow  \\space  x^2 + 5x + 4 = m +2x $$\n$$\\Rightarrow  \\space  x^2 + 5x + 4-m-2x =0 $$\n$$\\Rightarrow  \\space  x^2+3x+4-m=0  $$\nFor the equation to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant should be equal to zero.

        "ground_truth": "We begin by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation and adding $-m-2x$ to both sides. We get $x^2+3x+(4-m)=0$. For this quadratic to have exactly one real root, the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be equal to $0$. Thus, we require $9-4(4-m) = 0$. Solving, we get that $m=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}$."
