It is 10 units long and ends at the point $(-6, y)$ where $y > 0$. What is the value of $y$?",

The distance between the two points is 10, so we can write:\n\n$$10 = \\sqrt{(-6 - 2)^2 + (y - 5)^2}$$\n\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$100 = 64 + (y - 5)^2$$\n\n$$36 = (y - 5)^2$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$$6 = y - 5$$\n\n$$y = 11$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$.
