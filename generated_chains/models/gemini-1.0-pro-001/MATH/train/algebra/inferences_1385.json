        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246?",
        "inference": "The average of the two numbers is half of their sum, which is 246/2 = 123.\n\nThe product of two numbers is maximized when one number is the average minus some amount, and the other number is the average plus the same amount.\n\nLet x be the amount by which one number is less than the average. Then the other number is 123 + x.\n\nThe product of the two numbers is (123 - x)(123 + x) = 123^2 - x^2.\n\nThe value of x that maximizes the product is x = 0.\n\nTherefore, the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 246 is 123^2 = 15129.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{15129}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $246-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $(x)(246-x)=246x-x^2$. Now we complete the square: \\begin{align*}\n-(x^2-246x)&=-(x^2-246x+15129-15129)\\\\\n&=-(x-123)^2+15129\\\\\n\\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, $-(x-123)^2\\le 0$. Therefore, the expression is maximized when $x-123=0$, so $x=123$. Therefore, the greatest product obtainable is $-(123-123)^2+15129=\\boxed{15129}$."
