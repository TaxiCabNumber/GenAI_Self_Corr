        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes.  How long, in seconds, does it take six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub?  Assume that all faucets dispense water at the same rate.",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the rate at which the three faucets fill the tub:\nRate = Volume / Time = 100 gallons / 6 minutes = 16.67 gallons per minute\n\n**Step 2**: Find the rate at which one faucet fills the tub:\nRate per faucet = Rate / Number of faucets = 16.67 gallons / 3 faucets = 5.56 gallons per minute\n\n**Step 3**: Find the time it takes six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub:\nTime = Volume / Rate per faucet = 25 gallons / 5.56 gallons per minute = 4.5 minutes\n\n**Step 4**: Convert minutes to seconds:\nTime = 4.5 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 270 seconds\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{$270$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds."
