        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA geometric sequence of positive integers is formed for which the first term is 2 and the fifth term is 162. What is the sixth term of the sequence?",
        "inference": "The fifth term of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:\n$$a_5 = a_1 \\cdot r^4$$, \nwhere $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $a_5$ is the fifth term.\n\nWe are given that $a_1 = 2$ and $a_5 = 162$. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n$$162 = 2 \\cdot r^4$$\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n$$81 = r^4$$\nTaking the fourth root of both sides, we get:\n$$r = 3$$\nNow that we know the common ratio, we can use the formula:\n$$a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}$$\nto find the sixth term. Substituting $n = 6$, $a_1 = 2$, and $r = 3$ into the formula, we get:\n$$a_6 = 2 \\cdot 3^{6-1} = 2 \\cdot 3^5 = 2 \\cdot 243 = 486$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{486}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the geometric sequence have common ratio $r$. We know that $2\\cdot r^4=162$, or $r=3$. Thus, the sixth term is $2 \\cdot r^5 = 2 \\cdot 3^5 = \\boxed{486}$."
