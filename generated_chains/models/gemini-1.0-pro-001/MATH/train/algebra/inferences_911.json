        "inference": "Let the two fractions be $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$.\n\nWe have:  \n\n$$\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{11}{12}$$  \n$$\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{1}{6}$$  \n\nCross-multiplying the first equation, we get:  \n\n$$ad + bc = 11bd$$  \n\nSubstituting $\\frac{c}{d}$ from the second equation into the first equation, we get:  \n\n$$\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{ad}{6b} = \\frac{11}{12}$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides by 12b, we get:  \n\n$$12a + 2ad = 11b$$  \n\nFactoring out 2a, we get:  \n\n$$2a(6 + d) = 11b$$  \n\nSince 11 and 6 + d are both positive, 2a must be positive. Therefore, a is positive.\n\nSince a is positive, 6 + d must be positive. Therefore, d > -6.  \n\nNow, we can consider two cases:  \n\nCase 1: d = -5  \n\nSubstituting d = -5 into the second equation, we get:  \n\n$$\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{c}{-5} = \\frac{1}{6}$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides by -5, we get:  \n\n$$\\frac{ac}{b} = -\\frac{5}{6}$$  \n\nSince a is positive and c is negative, ac must be negative. Therefore, b must be negative.  \n\nSubstituting b = -1 into the first equation, we get:  \n\n$$\\frac{a}{-1} + \\frac{c}{-5} = \\frac{11}{12}$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides by -12, we get:  \n\n$$12a + 2c = 11$$  \n\nFactoring out 2, we get:  \n\n$$2(6a + c) = 11$$  \n\nSince 11 is odd, 6a + c must be odd. Therefore, c must be odd.  \n\nThe only odd factor of 11 is 1. Therefore, c = 1 and 6a = 10. Therefore, a = 5/3.  \n\nThe lesser of the two fractions is $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{5/3}{-1} = -\\frac{5}{3}$.  \n\nCase 2: d > -5  \n\nSince d > -5, 6 + d > 1. Therefore, 2a(6 + d) > 11b.  \n\nSince 11 and 2a(6 + d) are both positive, b must be positive.  \n\nSubstituting b = 1 into the first equation, we get:  \n\n$$\\frac{a}{1} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{11}{12}$$  \n\nMultiplying both sides by 12, we get:  \n\n$$12a + 12c = 11d$$  \n\nFactoring out 12, we get:  \n\n$$12(a + c) = 11d$$  \n\nSince 11 and 12 are coprime, a + c must be divisible by 11.  \n\nThe only factor of 11 that is less than 12 is 1. Therefore, a + c = 1.  \n\nSince a and c are both positive, a = 1 and c = 0.  \n\nThe lesser of the two fractions is $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.  \n\nTherefore, the lesser of the two fractions is  \n$$\\boxed{ \\frac{5}{3}}.$$",
