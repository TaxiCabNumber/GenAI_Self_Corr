At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Since $2>0$ we know that $f(2)=a(2)+3=5$. Solving for $a$, we get that $a=1$. With $x=0$, we get that $f(0)=ab=5$. We already know that $a=1$, so $b=5$. Because -2 is negative, we know that $f(-2)=b(-2)+c=(5)(-2)+c=-10$. This tells us that $c=0$, so our answer is $a+b+c=1+5+0=\\boxed{6}$."
