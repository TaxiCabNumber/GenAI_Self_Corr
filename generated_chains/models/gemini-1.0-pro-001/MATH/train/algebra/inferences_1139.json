At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of 18 consecutive positive integers is a perfect square.  What is the smallest possible value of this sum?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the smallest of the 18 consecutive positive integers. Then the sum of the 18 consecutive positive integers is\n\n$$n + (n+1) + (n+2) + \\cdots + (n+17) = 18n + 153.$$\n\nSince the sum is a perfect square, $18n + 153$ must be a perfect square. The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to $153$ is $169$, which is $13^2$. Therefore, $18n + 153 = 169$, so $18n = 16$, and $n = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n, n+1, \\dots , n+17$ be the 18 consecutive integers.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is \\[\\frac{n + (n + 17)}{2} \\cdot 18 = 9(2n + 17).\\]Since 9 is a perfect square, $2n+17$ must also be a perfect square. The smallest value of $n$ for which this occurs is  $n = 4$, so  $9(2n+17) = 9\\cdot 25 = \\boxed{225}$."
