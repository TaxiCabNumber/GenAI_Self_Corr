At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA line contains the points $(6,8)$, $(-2, k)$ and $(-10, 4)$. What is the value of $k$?",
        "inference": "If the points $(6,8)$, $(-2, k)$, and $(-10, 4)$ lie on the same straight line, the slopes of any two of the segments connecting these points must be equal. So we have $$\\frac{k-8}{-2-6} = \\frac{4-8}{-10-6}$$  $$\\frac{k-8}{-8} = \\frac{-4}{-16}$$ $$k-8 = \\frac{1}{4}$$ $$k=8+\\frac{1}{4}$$ $$k=\\frac{33}{4}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{33}{4}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The slope between the first two points must be the same as the slope between the second two points, because all three points lie on the same line. We thus have the equation $\\dfrac{k-8}{-2-6}=\\dfrac{4-k}{-10-(-2)}.$ Solving for $k$ yields $k=\\boxed{6}$."
