At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA certain organization consists of five leaders and some number of regular members. Every year, the current leaders are kicked out of the organization. Next, each regular member must find two new people to join as regular members. Finally, five new people are elected from outside the organization to become leaders. In the beginning, there are fifteen people in the organization total. How many people total will be in the organization five years from now?",
        "inference": "In the beginning, there are 15 people in the organization: 5 leaders and 10 regular members.\n\nAfter the first year, the 5 leaders are kicked out, and each of the 10 regular members finds 2 new regular members to join, so there are now 10 + 20 = 30 regular members. Then, 5 new leaders are elected from outside the organization, so there are now 30 + 5 = 35 people in the organization total.\n\nAfter the second year, the 5 leaders are kicked out, and each of the 30 regular members finds 2 new regular members to join, so there are now 30 + 60 = 90 regular members. Then, 5 new leaders are elected from outside the organization, so there are now 90 + 5 = 95 people in the organization total.\n\nAfter the third year, the 5 leaders are kicked out, and each of the 90 regular members finds 2 new regular members to join, so there are now 90 + 180 = 270 regular members. Then, 5 new leaders are elected from outside the organization, so there are now 270 + 5 = 275 people in the organization total.\n\nAfter the fourth year, the 5 leaders are kicked out, and each of the 270 regular members finds 2 new regular members to join, so there are now 270 + 540 = 810 regular members. Then, 5 new leaders are elected from outside the organization, so there are now 810 + 5 = 815 people in the organization total.\n\nAfter the fifth year, the 5 leaders are kicked out, and each of the 810 regular members finds 2 new regular members to join, so there are now 810 + 1620 = 2430 regular members. Then, 5 new leaders are elected from outside the organization, so there are now 2430 + 5 = 2435 people in the organization total.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\\\boxed{2435}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a_k$ denote the number of people in year $k$ (with initially $k=0$). One might notice that after the leaders are kicked out, there are $a_k-5$ regular members. Then, there are $3(a_k-5)$ regular members after the new regular members join. Finally, after the new leaders are elected, we have a grand total of $3(a_k-5)+5 = 3a_k-10$ people the next year. One might wish to solve this recursion with $a_0=15$. But there is an easier way.\n\nNotice that the number of leaders stays the same each year, and the number of regular members triples. Thus the number of regular members follows a geometric sequence. In the beginning, there are $15-5=10$ regular members. Therefore, five years later, there will be $(3^5)(10)=2430$ regular members. The total number of people will be $5+2430=\\boxed{2435}$."
