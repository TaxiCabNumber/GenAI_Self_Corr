At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box of 25 chocolate candies costs $\\$6$. How many dollars does it cost to buy 600 chocolate candies?",
        "inference": "To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the information given:\n\n\\frac{Cost of 25 candies}{Number of candies} = \\frac{Cost of 600 candies}{Number of candies}\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\n\\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{x}{600}\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = \\frac{6 \\times 600}{25}\n= 144\n\nTherefore, it costs $144 to buy 600 chocolate candies.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$144}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "600 chocolate candies is $\\frac{600}{25} = 24$ times as many candies as 25 candies.  Multiplying the number of candies by 24 multiplies the cost by 24, so 600 candies costs $24\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{144}$ dollars."
