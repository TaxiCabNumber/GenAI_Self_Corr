        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the equation $y = |x| - 3$ is translated two units to the left and three units down. What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nStep 1: Translating the graph of $y = |x| - 3$ two units to the left and three units down gives the graph of $y = |x + 2| - 6.$\nStep 2: The graph of $y = |x + 2| - 6$ has a minimum at the vertex $(-2, -6)$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{(-2, -6)}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $|x|$ is nonnegative, it is minimized when it equals 0, which occurs when $x=0$.  So, the minimum point of the graph of $y=|x| - 3$ is $(0,-3)$.  When we translate this to the left two units and three units down, we get the point $\\boxed{(-2,-6)}$."
