At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
        "inference": "Since the parabola has vertex at $(-4,0)$, the axis of symmetry is $x=-4$.\nThe parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=-75$ into the equation of the parabola, we get:\n$$-75 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \\Rightarrow -75 = a + b + c$$\nSince the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, we know that the axis of symmetry is $x=-4$ and that the parabola is symmetric about the axis of symmetry.\nTherefore, the point $(-3,a)$ is on the parabola, since it is the same distance from the axis of symmetry as the point $(1,-75)$.\nSubstituting $x=-3$ and $y=a$ into the equation of the parabola, we get:\n$$a = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c \\Rightarrow a = 9a - 3b + c$$\nCombining these two equations, we get:\n$$\\Rightarrow 9a - 3b + c=-75$$\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nFirst, we can solve the first equation for $c$:\n$$-75 = a + b + c \\Rightarrow c=-75-a-b$$\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n$$9a - 3b + c = 0 \\Rightarrow 9a - 3b - 75 - a - b = 0$$\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$$8a - 4b - 75 = 0 \\Rightarrow 8a - 4b = 75$$\nDividing both sides of this equation by $4$, we get:\n$$2a - b = \\frac{75}{4}$$\nNow, we can solve this equation for $a$:\n$$2a = b + \\frac{75}{4} \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{75}{8}$$\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{a = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{75}{8}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{a = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{75}{8}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$."
