        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLulu has a quadratic of the form $x^2+bx+44$, where $b$ is a specific positive number. Using her knowledge of how to complete the square, Lulu is able to rewrite this quadratic in the form $(x+m)^2+8$. What is $b$?",
        "inference": "We can complete the square of the given quadratic as follows:\n$$x^2+bx+44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2+bx+b^2/4-b^2/4+44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (x+b/2)^2+44-b^2/4$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (x+b/2)^2+8$$\nEquating this to the standard form of the completed square, we have:\n$$m=b/2 \\Rightarrow b=2m$$\nSubstituting this into the original quadratic, we have:\n$$x^2+bx+44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2+2mx+44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2+2mx+m^2-m^2+44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (x+m)^2+44-m^2$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (x+m)^2+8$$\nTherefore, $b=\\boxed{2m}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2m}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expansion of $(x+m)^2+8$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2+8$, which has a constant term of $m^2+8$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2+8 = 44$, which yields the possibilities $m=6$ and $m=-6$.\n\nIf $m=6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2+12x+44$. If $m=-6$, then $(x+m)^2+8 = x^2-12x+44$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+12x+44$, giving $b=\\boxed{12}$."
