What is the least integer number of days after which Mark will have to pay her back at least twice as much as he borrowed?",

        "ground_truth": "Since the interest rate is simple, he has to pay an interest of $10 \\cdot 0.15 =1.5$ dollars every day.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of days needed to repay at least double the amount borrowed. Since he has to repay $10 as well as $\\$1.5x$ in interest, we have the inequality $10+1.5x \\ge 10 \\cdot 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\ge 6.\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer greater than $6.\\overline{6}$ is $7$. Therefore, it would take at least $\\boxed{7 \\text{ days}}$."
