What are the coordinates of the other endpoint of this diameter?  Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.
