At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a sequence of positive integers each term after the first is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it in the sequence. What is the 5th term of this sequence if the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34?",

Also, given that $a_4=\\frac{1}{3}(a_3+a_5)$, we get $a_5=3a_4-a_3=3a_4-(3a_2-2)=9a_2-10$. Therefore, $a_5=\\boxed{9(4)-10=36-10=26}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct.",
