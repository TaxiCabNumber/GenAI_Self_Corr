At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the discriminant of $3x^2 - 7x - 12$?",
        "inference": "The discriminant is given by the formula $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.\n\nIn this case, $a = 3$, $b = -7$, and $c = -12$, so the discriminant is $(-7)^2 - 4(3)(-12) = 49 + 144 = 193$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{193}$.

        "ground_truth": "We simply plug into $b^2 - 4ac = (-7)^2 - 4(3)(-12) = 49 + 144 = \\boxed{193},$ and that is our answer."
