        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is $30$.   If we double the larger number, and subtract three times the smaller number, the result is 5.  What is the positive difference between the two numbers?",
