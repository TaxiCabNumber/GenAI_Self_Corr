At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRamon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $\\$$2.50 and he sells three enchiladas and two tacos for $\\$$2.70. Assuming a fixed price per item, what is the cost, in dollars, of three enchiladas and four tacos? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "Let E be the cost of one enchilada and T be the cost of one taco.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n2E + 3T = $2.50\n3E + 2T = $2.70\nSolving the first equation for E, we get:\nE = ($2.50 - 3T) / 2\nSubstituting this expression for E into the second equation, we get:\n3(($2.50 - 3T) / 2) + 2T = $2.70\nSimplifying and solving for T, we get:\nT = $0.50\nSubstituting this value of T back into the expression for E, we get:\nE = ($2.50 - 3($0.50)) / 2 = $0.75\nTherefore, the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos is:\n3E + 4T = 3($0.75) + 4($0.50) = $3.75\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$3.75}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that a taco costs $t$ dollars and and enchiladas cost $e$ dollars each.  Then the given information implies that $2e + 3t = 2.50$ and $3e + 2t = 2.70$.  Multiplying the first equation by 3 yields $6e + 9t = 7.50$, and multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $6e + 4t = 5.40$.  Subtracting these two equations, we see that $5t = 2.10$.  Thus one taco costs $\\frac{2.10}{5} = .42$, and two tacos are $.84$.  Since we are given the price of three enchiladas and two tacos, we see that three enchiladas and four tacos total $2.70 + .84 = \\boxed{\\$3.54}$."
