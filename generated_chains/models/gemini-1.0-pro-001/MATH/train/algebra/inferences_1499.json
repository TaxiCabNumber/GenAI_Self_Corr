At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle with integer leg lengths is called \"cool'' if the number of square units in its area is equal to twice the number of units in the sum of the lengths of its legs. What is the sum of all the different possible areas of cool right triangles?",
        "inference": "Let \\(a,b\\) be the legs, and \\(c\\) be the hypotenuse of the triangle. Then the area is \\({1 \\over 2}ab\\) and the sum of the legs is \\(a+b\\). Since the triangle is a right triangle, we have \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). We want \\(ab = 2(a+b)\\), which gives \\(ab = 2(a+b)\\). We can substitute this into the first equation to get \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = 4(a+b)\\). This gives \\(a^2 -2ab+ b^2 = 0 \\rightarrow (a - b)^2 = 0 \\rightarrow a = b\\). Therefore, the only cool right triangle is the isosceles right triangle with legs of length \\(1\\).\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{0.5}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the leg lengths of the right triangle be $a$ and $b.$ It follows that $\\frac{ab}{2}=2(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side, $ab-4a-4b=0.$ Adding 16 to both sides allows us to factor: \\[a(b-4)-4(b-4)=(a-4)(b-4)=16. \\] From this point, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(5,20),$ $(6,12),$ and $(8,8),$ and the sum of the possible areas is $50 + 36 + 32 = \\boxed{118}$."
