At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many real numbers $a^{}_{}$ does the quadratic equation $x^2 + ax^{}_{} + 6a=0$ have only integer roots for $x^{}_{}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe quadratic equation $x^2 + ax + 6a = 0$ has integer roots if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. The discriminant is $a^2 - 24a$. So, we want to solve the equation $a^2 - 24a = k^2$ for $a$. We can rewrite this as $a^2 -24a -k^2 = 0$. Completing the square, we get $(a-12)^2 - k^2 = 144$. Factoring, we get $(a-12-k)(a-12+k)=144$. Since $144$ is a multiple of $3$, we must have $a-12-k$ and $a-12+k$ both divisible by $3$. The only way this can happen is if $k$ is divisible by $3$. Therefore, the equation $a^2 - 24a = k^2$ has integer solutions for $a$ if and only if $k$ is divisible by $3$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.**",
