At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "1. The denominator must be non-negative, so $x-1\\ge0\\Rightarrow x\\ge1$.\n2. The argument of the logarithm must be positive, so $3-x>0\\Rightarrow x<3$.\nTherefore, the domain of the function is $1\\le x<3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\\\boxed{1\\le x<3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression inside the square root must be greater than 0 because the denominator cannot be equal to 0. Therefore, $x-1>0$, so $x>1$. The expression inside the logarithm must be greater than 0, so $3-x>0$, which gives $x<3$. Therefore, the interval of $x$ for which the expression $\\frac{\\log{(3-x)}}{\\sqrt{x-1}}$ is defined is $1<x<3$, which is $\\boxed{(1,3)}$."
