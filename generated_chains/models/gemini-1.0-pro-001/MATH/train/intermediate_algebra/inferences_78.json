        "inference": "```\n**Step 1:** Find the critical points.\n\nThe critical points are the values of x that make the numerator or denominator equal to zero.\n\n* Numerator: x - 2 = 0, x - 3 = 0, x - 4 = 0\n* Denominator: x - 1 = 0, x - 5 = 0, x - 6 = 0\n\nSo the critical points are x = 1, x = 2, x = 3, x = 4, x = 5, and x = 6.\n\n**Step 2:** Create a sign chart.\n\nWe need to determine the sign of the expression for each interval determined by the critical points. We can do this by plugging in a test point from each interval into the expression.\n\n* Interval (-\u221e, 1): Test point x = 0. Expression is negative.\n* Interval (1, 2): Test point x = 1.5. Expression is positive.\n* Interval (2, 3): Test point x = 2.5. Expression is negative.\n* Interval (3, 4): Test point x = 3.5. Expression is positive.\n* Interval (4, 5): Test point x = 4.5. Expression is negative.\n* Interval (5, 6): Test point x = 5.5. Expression is positive.\n* Interval (6, \u221e): Test point x = 7. Expression is negative.\n\n**Step 3:** Write the solution.\n\nThe expression is positive for the intervals (1, 2), (3, 4), and (5, 6). So the solution is:\n\n```\n1 < x < 2 or 3 < x < 4 or 5 < x < 6\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{1 < x < 2 or 3 < x < 4 or 5 < x < 6}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases.  At $x = 0,$ the expression is positive.  As $x$ increases past 1, the expression becomes negative.  As $x$ increases past 2, the expression becomes positive, and so on.  Thus, the solution is\n\\[x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,1) \\cup (2,3) \\cup (4,5) \\cup (6,\\infty)}.\\]"
