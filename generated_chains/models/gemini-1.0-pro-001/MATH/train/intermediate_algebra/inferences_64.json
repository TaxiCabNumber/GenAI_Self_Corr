The graph of a rational function has an oblique asymptote at $y=mx+b$ if $\\lim\\limits_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} (f(x)-(mx+b))=0$.\n\n\n- The denominator of the given function is $x^3+x^2-2x=x(x^2+x-2)=x(x-1)(x+2)$. Therefore, the graph has vertical asymptotes at $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-2$. So, $b=3$.\n\n\n- The numerator of the given function is $x^2+3x+2=(x+1)(x+2)$. Therefore, the graph has no holes. So, $a=0$.\n\n\n- To find the horizontal asymptote, we can use the following theorem:\n If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$.\n If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, then the horizontal asymptote is the quotient of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator.\n If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, then there is no horizontal asymptote.\nIn this case, the degree of the numerator is 2 and the degree of the denominator is 3. Therefore, there is no horizontal asymptote. So, $c=0$.\n\n\n- To find the oblique asymptote, we can use long division to divide the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\\begin{array}{c} \\quad x+1 \\\\ x^3+x^2-2x \\overline{)x^2+3x+2} \\\\\\ \\underline{x^3+x^2-2x} \\\\\\ \\quad 4x+2 \\end{array}$$\nTherefore, the quotient is $x+1$ and the remainder is $4x+2$. Therefore, the oblique asymptote is $y=x+1$. So, $d=1$.\n\n\n- Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d=0+2(3)+3(0)+4(1)=8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
