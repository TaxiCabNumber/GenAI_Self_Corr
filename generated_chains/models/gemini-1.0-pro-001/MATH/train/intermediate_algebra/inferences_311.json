In other words, $a + b + c$ is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the parabola whose $x$-coordinate is 1.  But this parabola is obtained by shifting the graph of $y = 2x^2 - x + 7$ four units to the right, so $a + b + c$ is also the $y$-coordinate of the point on the original parabola whose $x$-coordinate is $1 - 4 = -3$.
