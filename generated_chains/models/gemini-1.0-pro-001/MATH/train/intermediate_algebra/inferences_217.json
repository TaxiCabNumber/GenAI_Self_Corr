At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ellipse has foci $(2, 2)$ and $(2, 6)$, and it passes through the point $(14, -3).$ Given this, we can write the equation of the ellipse in standard form as \\[\\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\\]where $a, b, h, k$ are constants, and $a$ and $b$ are positive. Find the ordered quadruple $(a, b, h, k)$.\n\n(Enter your answer as an ordered list, for example, \"1, 3, -9, 2\".)",

        "ground_truth": "The sum of the distances from $(14, -3)$ to the two foci is \\[\\sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-2)^2} + \\sqrt{(14-2)^2 + (-3-6)^2} = 13 + 15 = 28.\\]Therefore, the major axis has length $28.$ Since the distance between the foci is $\\sqrt{(2-2)^2 + (2-6)^2} = 4,$ it follows that the length of the minor axis is $\\sqrt{28^2 - 4^2} = 4\\sqrt{7^2 - 1} = 4\\sqrt{48} = 16\\sqrt3.$\n\nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between the foci, which is $(2, 4).$ Since the foci and the center have the same $x$-coordinate, the major axis is parallel to the $y$-axis, and the minor axis is parallel to the $x$-axis. Putting all this together, we get the equation of the ellipse: \\[\\frac{(x-2)^2}{(8\\sqrt3)^2} + \\frac{(y-4)^2}{14^2} = 1. \\]Thus, $(a, b, h, k) = \\boxed{ (8\\sqrt3, 14, 2, 4)}.$"
