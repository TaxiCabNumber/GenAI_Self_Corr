At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the rational function $\\frac{2x^6+3x^5 - x^2 - 1}{q(x)}$  has a horizontal asymptote. What is the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nSince the numerator has a higher degree than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote occurs when the degree of the numerator is 1 greater than the degree of the denominator. Therefore, the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ is the degree of the numerator minus 1, which is\n\n$$6-1=5$$\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For the given function to have a horizontal asymptote, the function will need to approach a constant as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. This is only possible if the denominator $q(x)$ is at least the same degree as the numerator. Since the numerator has degree $6$, the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will allow the function to have a horizontal asymptote is $\\boxed{6}$.  For example, we can take $q(x) = x^6.$"
