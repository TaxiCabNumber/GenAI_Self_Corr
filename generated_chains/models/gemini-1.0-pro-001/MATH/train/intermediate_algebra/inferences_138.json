        "ground_truth": "Since the given function has vertical asymptotes at $2$ and $-2$, we know that $q(2) = q(-2) = 0$ (i.e. $2$ and $-2$ are roots of $q(x)$).

In other words, we can write it as $q(x) = a(x+2)(x-2)$ for some constant $a$.  Since $q(3) = 15$, we have $a(3+2)(3-2) = 15$.\n\nSolving for $a$ gives $a = 15/5 = 3$.
