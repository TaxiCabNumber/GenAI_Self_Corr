I hope it is correct.'\nA famous theorem states that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there is a unique conic section (ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) which passes through all five points. The conic section passing through the five points \\[(-\\tfrac32, 1), \\; (0,0), \\;(0,2),\\; (3,0),\\; (3,2).\\]is an ellipse whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the length of its minor axis.",
