        "inference": "The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment that connects the two endpoints of the ellipse's major axis, which is the segment with length 10 that connects $(-2, 4)$ and $(8, 4)$.  Therefore, the center of the ellipse is $((8-2)/2, (4+4)/2) = (3, 4)$.\n\nThe length of the major axis is $2a = 10$, so $a = 5$.  The length of the minor axis is $2b$, where $b$ is the distance between the center and either endpoint of the ellipse's minor axis, which is the segment with length 6 that connects $(3, -2)$ and $(3, 4)$.  Therefore, $2b = 6$, so $b = 3$.\n\nUsing the relationship $c^2 = a^2-b^2$, we get that $c^2 = 5^2-3^2 = 16$, so $c = 4$.  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = 2(4) = \\boxed{8}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The two axes of the ellipse are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Therefore, each endpoint of an axis must be equidistant from the two endpoints of the other axis. The only point of the given three which is equidistant from the other two is $(3, -2)$, so the fourth missing point must be the other endpoint of its axis, and the points $(-2, 4)$ and $(8, 4)$ must be endpoints of the same axis.\n\nThen the center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the segment between $(-2,4)$ and $(8,4),$ which is the point $(3,4)$. This means that the semi-horizontal axis has length $8-3 = 5,$ and the semi-vertical axis has length $4-(-2) = 6.$ Thus, the distance between the foci is $2 \\sqrt{6^2 - 5^2} =\\boxed{2 \\sqrt{11}}.$"
