I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain hyperbola, the center is at $(2,0),$ one focus is at $(2,6),$ and one vertex is at $(2,-3).$  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as\n\\[\\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]Find $h + k + a + b.$",
        "inference": "The distance from the center to a vertex is $a$.  Therefore, $a = 3.$\n\nThe distance from the center to a focus is $c$.  Therefore, $c = 6.$\n\nThe relationship between $a, b,$ and $c$ is $c^2 = a^2 + b^2.$  Substituting, we have $6^2 = 3^2 + b^2.$  Solving for $b$, we have $b = \\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}.$\n\nThe center is at $(2,0)$, so $h = 2$ and $k = 0$.\n\nTherefore, $h + k + a + b = 2 + 0 + 3 + 3\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{5 + 3\\sqrt{3}}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5 + 3\\sqrt{3}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
