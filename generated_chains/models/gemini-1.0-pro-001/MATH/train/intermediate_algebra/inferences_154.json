        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ has the property that the mean of its zeros, the product of its zeros, and the sum of the coefficients are all equal. The $y$-intercept of the graph of $y = P(x)$ is 8. What is $b$?",
        "inference": "The mean of the zeros is $-\\frac{a}{6}$. The sum of the zeros is $-\\frac{b}{2}$. The product of the zeros is $-\\frac{c}{2}$. Then we have $-\\frac{a}{6} = -\\frac{b}{2} = -\\frac{c}{2} = 8$. Therefore, $a = 24, b = 12,$ and $c = 12$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $y$-intercept of the graph is the point at which $x=0$. At that point, $P(x)=c$, which we are told is equal to 8. Thus, $c=8$. The product of the roots of the given polynomial is $-\\frac{c}{2}=-4$. The problem states that the mean of the zeros must also equal $-4$, so the sum of the three zeros (this is a cubic equation) is equal to $3 \\cdot -4 = -12$. The sum of the zeros is also equal to $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $a=24$. Finally, we are given that the sum of the coefficients, or $2+ a+b+c$, is also equal to $-4$. Plugging in our known values of $a$ and $c$, we have $2+24+b+8=-4$. Solving for $b$, we get $b=\\boxed{-38}$."
