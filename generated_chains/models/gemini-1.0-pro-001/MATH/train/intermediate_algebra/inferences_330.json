At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 are arranged in a multiplication table, with three along the top and the other three down the left.  The multiplication table is completed and the sum of the nine entries is tabulated.  What is the largest possible sum of the nine entries?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|}\n\\times & a & b & c \\\\ \\hline \\hline\nd & & & \\\\ \\hline\ne & & & \\\\ \\hline\nf & & & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]",
