At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a unique polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $4$ with rational coefficients and leading coefficient $1$ which has $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5}$ as a root. What is $P(1)$?",
        "inference": "Let $P(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 +cx + d$. Since $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5}$ is a root, we have $$\\begin{align} (\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5})^4 + a(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5})^3 + b(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5})^2 +c(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5}) + d &= 0, \\\\\\ 24+20\\sqrt{10} + a(12+5\\sqrt{10})+b(7+2\\sqrt{10})+c(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{5})+d&=0. \\end{align}$$ Equating real and imaginary parts, we get $$\\begin{align} 24+a12+b7+c\\sqrt{2}+d&=0, \\\\\\ 20\\sqrt{10}+5a\\sqrt{10}+2b\\sqrt{10}+c\\sqrt{5}&=0. \\end{align}$$ This gives the system $$\\begin{align} 24+12a+7b+c\\sqrt{2}+d&=0, \\\\\\ 2b\\sqrt{10}&=-20\\sqrt{10}-5a\\sqrt{10}-c\\sqrt{5}. \\end{align}$$ Since $\\sqrt{10}$ is irrational, we must have $b=0$. Then $$\\begin{align} 24+12a+c\\sqrt{2}+d&=0, \\\\\\ -5a\\sqrt{10}-c\\sqrt{5}&=0. \\end{align}$$ Thus $a=-c\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{10}}=-c\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=-\\frac{c\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

Thus $P(x) = x^4 - 6x^2 \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $P(1) = 1^4 - 6(1)^2 \\sqrt{2} = 1-6\\sqrt{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1-6\\sqrt{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
