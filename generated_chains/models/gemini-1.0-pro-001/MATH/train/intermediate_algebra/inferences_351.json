        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can write $p(x)$ in the form $p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3$. Since $p(1) = -7$, we have $a + b + c + d = -7$. Similarly, $p(2) = -9$ gives $a + 2b + 4c + 8d = -9$, $p(3) = -15$ gives $a + 3b + 9c + 27d = -15$ and $p(4) = -31$ gives $a + 4b + 16c + 64d = -31$. We can solve these equations to find $a, b, c,$ and $d$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $b + 3c + 7d = -2$. Subtracting the first equation from the third equation, we get $2b + 8c + 26d = -8$. Subtracting the first equation from the fourth equation, we get $3b + 15c + 63d = -24$. We can solve these equations to find $b, c,$ and $d$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $b + 3c + 7d = -2$.
