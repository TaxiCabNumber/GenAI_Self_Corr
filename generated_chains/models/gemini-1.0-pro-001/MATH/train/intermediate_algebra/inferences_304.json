At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a$ and $b$ be real numbers.  Consider the following five statements:\n\n$\\frac{1}{a} < \\frac{1}{b}$\n$a^2 > b^2$\n$a < b$\n$a < 0$\n$b < 0$\n\nWhat is the maximum number of these statements that can be true for any values of $a$ and $b$?",
        "inference": "Statement 1 and 3 are equivalent since $\\frac{1}{a} < \\frac{1}{b}$ is the same as $\\frac{b}{a} > 1$, which in turn is the same as $b > a$.  Similarly, statement 4 and 5 are equivalent.  Thus, at most 3 of the statements can be true for any values of $a$ and $b$.  For instance, if we let $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, then statements 1, 2, and 3 are true.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
