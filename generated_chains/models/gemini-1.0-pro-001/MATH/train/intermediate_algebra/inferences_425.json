I hope it is correct.'\nA polynomial $p(x)$ is called self-centered if it has integer coefficients and $p(100) = 100.$  If $p(x)$ is a self-centered polynomial, what is the maximum number of integer solutions $k$ to the equation $p(k) = k^3$?",
        "inference": "Since $p(x)$ is self-centered, we know that $p(100) = 100$.  In other words, $p(x)$ is divisible by $x - 100$.  Therefore, $p(x) = (x - 100)q(x)$ for some polynomial $q(x)$.\n\nNow, let $k$ be an integer such that $p(k) = k^3$.  Then we have \\[(k - 100)q(k) = k^3.\\]  Since $k - 100$ and $k^3$ are integers, $q(k)$ must also be an integer.\n\nSince $q(k)$ is an integer, $k - 100$ must be a factor of $k^3$.  The only factors of $k^3$ are $1$, $k$, $k^2$, $k^3$, $-1$, $-k$, $-k^2$, and $-k^3$.  Since $k - 100$ is positive, it must be one of $1$, $k$, $k^2$, or $k^3$.\n\nIf $k - 100 = 1$, then $k = 101$ and $p(k) = 101^3 = 1,030,301$.  However, $101$ is not a root of $p(x)$, since $p(101) = 101^3 - 100^3 = 101^2 = 10,201$.\n\nIf $k - 100 = k$, then $k = 100$ and $p(k) = 100^3 = 1,000,000$.  However, $100$ is not a root of $p(x)$, since $p(100) = 100^3 = 1,000,000$.\n\nIf $k - 100 = k^2$, then $k^2 - k - 100 = 0$.  Factoring, we get $(k - 10)(k + 10) = 0$.  Therefore, $k = 10$ or $k = -10$.  However, neither $10$ nor $-10$ is a root of $p(x)$, since $p(10) = 10^3 - 100^3 = -900$ and $p(-10) = (-10)^3 - 100^3 = -1000$.\n\nIf $k - 100 = k^3$, then $k^3 - k + 100 = 0$.
