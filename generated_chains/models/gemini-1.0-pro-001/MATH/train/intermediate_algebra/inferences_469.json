At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation \\[\\frac{x^2}{36} + \\frac{(y+5)^2}{16} = 0\\]describes a degenerate ellipse, because the right-hand side is $0$ instead of $1$ (as in the standard form for an ellipse). Of all the points on the graph of this equation, what is the largest possible $y$-coordinate?",

That is, we must have \\[\\frac{x^2}{36} = 0 \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad \\frac{(y+5)^2}{16} = 0,\\]which implies that $x=0$ and $y=-5.$ Since $(x,y)=(0,-5)$ satisfies the given equation, it is the only point on the graph of this equation, so the answer is $\\boxed{-5}.$"
