The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.",
        "inference": "The greatest possible value of $x+y$ occurs when the set contains two large numbers and two small numbers. Let the large numbers be $a$ and $b$, and the small numbers be $c$ and $d$. Then the six pairwise sums are\n\n$$a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d.$$\n\nThe sum of these six numbers is $2(a+b+c+d)$. Since the sum of the six numbers is $189+320+287+234+x+y$, we have\n\n$$2(a+b+c+d)=189+320+287+234+x+y.$$\n\nSolving for $x+y$, we get\n\n$$x+y=2(a+b+c+d)-189-320-287-234.$$\n\nSince $a+b+c+d$ is the sum of the four numbers in the set, it is at most $189+320+287+234=1030$.
