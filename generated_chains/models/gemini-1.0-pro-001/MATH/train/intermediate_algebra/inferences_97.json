There exists a complex number $w$ such that the three roots of $P(z)$ are $w+3i$, $w+9i$, and $2w-4$, where $i^2=-1$. Find $a+b+c$.",
        "inference": "First, we know that the sum of the roots of $P(z)$ is $-a/3$. So, we have $w+3i+w+9i+2w-4=-a/3$, which gives $4w+8i=-a/3$. Therefore, $w=-a/12-2i$.\n\nNext, we know that the product of the roots of $P(z)$ is $-c/3$. So, we have $(w+3i)(w+9i)(2w-4)=-c/3$. Plugging in the value of $w$ that we found earlier, we get $\\left(-\\frac{a}{12}-2i+3i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{12}-2i+9i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2a}{12}-4\\right)=-c/3$. Simplifying, we get $\\left(-\\frac{a}{12}+i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{12}+7i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{6}-4\\right)=-c/3$.

Simplifying, we get $\\frac{a^3}{864}+\\frac{10a^2}{144}i+\\frac{27a}{72}+\\frac{28}{12}=-c/3$. Multiplying by $3$, we get $a^3+30a^2i+81a+84=-3c$. Therefore, $c=-a^3-30a^2i-81a-84$.\n\nFinally, we know that the constant term of $P(z)$ is $c$. So, we have $c=-a^3-30a^2i-81a-84$. Therefore, $a+b+c=-a^3-30a^2i-81a-84+a-a^3-30a^2i-81a-84=-2a^3-60a^2i-162a-168$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-2a^3-60a^2i-162a-168}. I hope it is correct.",
