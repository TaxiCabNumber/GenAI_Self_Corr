At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the sum of the rational roots of $g(x)=x^3-9x^2+16x-4$.",
        "inference": "The rational roots of a polynomial are the rational numbers that, when plugged in for the variable, make the polynomial equal to zero. To find the rational roots of $g(x)$, we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that the rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients are of the form $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is $-4$ and the leading coefficient is $1$, so the possible rational roots are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, and $\\pm4$. We can test each of these values by plugging them into $g(x)$ and seeing if the result is zero. We find that $g(1) = 0$, so $1$ is a rational root of $g(x)$.\n\nTo find the other rational roots, we can divide $g(x)$ by $x-1$ using polynomial long division. We get:\n\n```\n    x^2 - 8x + 4\nx - 1 | x^3 - 9x^2 + 16x - 4\n    - (x^3 - x^2)\n    -----------------\n    -8x^2 + 16x - 4\n    - (-8x^2 + 8x)\n    -----------------\n    8x - 4\n    - (8x - 8)\n    -----------------\n    0\n```\n\nTherefore, $g(x) = (x-1)(x^2 - 8x + 4)$. The other two rational roots of $g(x)$ are the roots of the quadratic factor $x^2 - 8x + 4$. We can use the quadratic formula to find these roots:\n\n```\nx = $\\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{48}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}$\n```\n\nTherefore, the three rational roots of $g(x)$ are $1$, $4 + 2\\sqrt{3}$, and $4 - 2\\sqrt{3}$. The sum of these roots is:\n\n$1 + (4 + 2\\sqrt{3}) + (4 - 2\\sqrt{3}) = 9$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root $p/q$ of $g(x)$ must have $p$ divide $4$ and $q$ divide 1. In particular, this means any rational root must be an integer divisor of 4.\n\nBy trying out the integer factors of 4, we find that $g(2) = 8-9\\cdot4+16\\cdot2-4=0$. Hence by the Factor theorem, $x-2$ is a factor of $g(x)$. With polynomial division, we can write $g(x) = (x-2)(x^2-7x+2).$ We can find the remaining roots of $g(x)$ by finding the roots of $x^2-7x+2$ using the quadratic formula. This gives us\n\\[x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49-8} }{2} =\\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{41} }{2} .\\]Since these are definitely not rational, the sum of the rational roots of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{2}.$"
