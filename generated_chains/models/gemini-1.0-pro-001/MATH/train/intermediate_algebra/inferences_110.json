        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet \\[f(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\nx^2+2 &\\text{if } x<n, \\\\\n2x+5 &\\text{if }x\\ge{n}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]If the graph $y=f(x)$ is continuous, find the sum of all possible values of $n$.",
        "inference": "Since the graph is continuous, the function must be continuous at $x=n$. Therefore, the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of the function at $x=n$ must be equal.\n\n**Left-hand limit:** $\\lim_{x\\to n^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to n^-} (x^2+2) = n^2+2$\n\n**Right-hand limit:** $\\lim_{x\\to n^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x\\to n^+} (2x+5) = 2n+5$\n\nSince the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are equal, we have $n^2+2 = 2n+5$. Solving for $n$, we get $n^2-2n+3 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(n-1)(n-3) = 0$. Therefore, $n = 1$ or $n = 3$.\n\nThe sum of all possible values of $n$ is $1+3 = \\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the graph of $f(x)$ is continuous, the two pieces of the function must meet at $x=n$. In order for this to happen, we know that $n^2+2=2n+5$. Moving all the terms to one side, we are left with the quadratic $n^2-2n-3=0$. Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is just $-\\frac{b}{a}$. Since the roots of this quadratic are the only possible values of $n$, our final answer is $-\\frac{2}{1}=\\boxed{2}$."
