So, the line $y=0$ is the axis of symmetry of the parabola and the circle.\n\nLet $A=(a,0)$ and $B=(b,0)$. Then, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is $AB=\\sqrt{(b-a)^2}$.\n\nWe know that $A$ and $B$ lie on the parabola, so $a^2=8a$ and $b^2=8b$.\n\nWe also know that $A$ and $B$ lie on the circle, so $a^2-2a+y^2=0$ and $b^2-2b+y^2=0$.\n\nSubstituting $y=0$ into these equations, we get $a^2-2a=0$ and $b^2-2b=0$.\n\nSolving these equations, we get $a=0$ and $b=2$.\n\nTherefore, $AB=\\sqrt{(b-a)^2}=\\sqrt{(2-0)^2}=\\boxed{2}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$.
