At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhich type of conic section is described by the equation \\[|y+5| = \\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2}?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",

This means that the graph will be a circle centered at $(2,-5)$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{C}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We try to rewrite the given equation in one of the standard forms of a conic section. Because both sides are nonnegative, we may square both sides, knowing that this operation is reversible: \\[(y+5)^2 = (x-2)^2 + y^2.\\]Then \\[(y+5)^2 - y^2 = (x-2)^2,\\]or \\[10y + 25 = x^2 - 4x + 4.\\]Because there is an $x^2$ term but no $y^2$ term, we recognize that this equation describes a $\\boxed{\\text{(P)}}$ parabola."
