        "ground_truth": "Since our divisor $(x^2-4)(x+1)$ has degree $3$, our remainder must have degree at most $2$. In other words, our remainder is of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the quotient of the division be $q(x)$. Then\n$$x^5-x^4-x^3+x^2+x =(x^2-4)(x+1)q(x) + ax^2+bx+c $$We can see that our divisor $(x^2-4)(x+1)$ has roots $x=2$, $x= -2,$ and $x= -1$.
