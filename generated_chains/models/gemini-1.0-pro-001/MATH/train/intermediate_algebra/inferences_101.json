        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest integer value of $x$ such that $\\frac{x^2 + 2x + 5}{x-3}$ is an integer?",
        "inference": "The numerator can be factored as $(x+5)(x-1)$.  Since the denominator is $x-3$, the only way the fraction can be an integer is if $x-1$ is a factor of the numerator.  Thus, $x=1$ or $x=-5$.  Since we are looking for the greatest integer value, the answer is $x=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's write $x^2+2x+5$ in the form $(x-3)(x+a)+c$ for some integers $a$ and $c$.  Since $(x-3)(x+a)=x^2+(a-3)x-3a$, we set $a-3=2$ to find $a=5$. Expanding $(x-3)(x+5)$, we find $c=20$.  So \\[\n\\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}=x+5+\\frac{20}{x-3}.\n\\] Since $x+5$ is always an integer, $\\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}$ is an integer if and only if $\\frac{20}{x-3}$ is an integer.  The largest divisor of 20 is 20, so $\\boxed{23}$ is the largest value of $x$ for which $\\frac{x^2+2x+5}{x-3}$ is an integer."
