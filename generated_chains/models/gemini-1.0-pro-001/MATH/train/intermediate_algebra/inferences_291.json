I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial equation \\[x^3 + bx + c = 0,\\]where $b$ and $c$ are rational numbers, has $5-\\sqrt{2}$ as a root. It also has an integer root. What is it?",
        "inference": "Since $5-\\sqrt{2}$ is a root, we have\n$$(5-\\sqrt{2})^3 + b(5-\\sqrt{2}) + c = 0.$$Expanding the left side and simplifying, we get\n$$125 - 15\\sqrt{2} + 10 - 3b\\sqrt{2} + b + c = 0.$$Equating the coefficients of like terms, we get the following system of equations:\n$$\\begin{align}\n125 + 10 &= 0, \\\\\n-15\\sqrt{2} - 3b\\sqrt{2} &= 0, \\\\\nb + c &= 0.\n\\end{align}$$The first equation gives $b = -125$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $\\sqrt{2}(3b+15) = 0$, which implies that $b=-5$. Substituting this into the third equation, we get $c = 5$. Since we assumed that $b$ and $c$ are rational numbers, we have\n$$b = -5, \\qquad c = 5.$$\nTherefore, the polynomial equation is\n$$x^3 - 5x + 5 = 0.$$To find the integer root, we can use synthetic division.
