At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe integer $x$ has 12 positive factors. The numbers 12 and 15 are factors of $x$. What is $x$?",
        "inference": "The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\nThe factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15.\nThe common factors of 12 and 15 are 1 and 3.\nTherefore, the prime factorization of $x$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$.\nHence, $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 180$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$180$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$."
