At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBilly and Bobbi each selected a positive integer less than 200. Billy's number is a multiple of 18, and Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24. What is the probability that they selected the same number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Since Billy's number is a multiple of 18, it must be of the form 18k, where k is a positive integer. Similarly, since Bobbi's number is a multiple of 24, it must be of the form 24m, where m is a positive integer.\n\nFor Billy and Bobbi to have selected the same number, we must have 18k = 24m. Dividing both sides by 6, we get 3k = 4m. This implies that k = 4/3m. Since k and m are both positive integers, 4/3m must be an integer. The only positive integer that satisfies this condition is m = 3, which gives k = 4.\n\nTherefore, Billy's number is 18k = 18 * 4 = 72, and Bobbi's number is 24m = 24 * 3 = 72.\n\nThe probability that they selected the same number is 1/199, since there are 199 different positive integers less than 200, and only one of them (72) is a multiple of both 18 and 24.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{199}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must first find how many positive integers less than 200 are multiples of both 18 and 24. $18=2\\cdot3^2$ and $24=2^3\\cdot3$, so the LCM of 18 and 24 is $2^3\\cdot3^2=72$. Therefore, an integer is a multiple of both 18 and 24 if and only if it is a multiple of 72.\n\nDividing 200 by 72 gives quotient 2 (and remainder 56), so there are 2 multiples of 72 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 18 gives quotient 11 (and remainder 2), so there are 11 multiples of 18 less than 200.\n\nDividing 200 by 24 gives quotient 8 (and remainder 8), so there are 8 multiples of 24 less than 200.\n\nTherefore, Billy and Bobbi together can pick $11\\cdot8=88$ different two-number combinations, and 2 of these involve them choosing the same number (the two multiples of 72 are the possible duplicate numbers). Thus, the probability that they selected the same number is $2/88=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{44}}$."
