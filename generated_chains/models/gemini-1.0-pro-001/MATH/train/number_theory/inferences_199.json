        "inference": "Solution:\n$\\frac{12}{37}=0.324324324...$.\nThe period of the decimal is $4$, so the $308$th digit to the right of the decimal point is the $2$nd digit in the period.\nTherefore, the $308$th digit is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
