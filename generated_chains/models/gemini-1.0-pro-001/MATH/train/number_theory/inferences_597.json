        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000?\n",
        "inference": "Since $N$ is a multiple of 8, it must end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. \n\nSince no digits are repeated, $N$ cannot end in 0 (contains '00'). \n\nIt cannot end in 2 or 4 (contains '22' or '44'), and it cannot end in 6 or 8 because then $N$ would be divisible by 20 and thus divisible by 100 and not just by 1000.\n\nSo, $N$ ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, and no two digits are repeated. The only digit that can be used is 1 since no other digit, except 0, is not repeated. \n\nTherefore, $N$ is $1234$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1234}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$."
