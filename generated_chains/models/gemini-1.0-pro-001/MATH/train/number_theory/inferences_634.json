I hope it is correct.'\nFor positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",

Thus, we need to find the number of positive integers $k$ less than $1000$ such that $k+1$ is not a multiple of $7$ and $k+1$ is not a multiple of $8$.\n\nThe positive integers less than $1000$ that are multiples of $7$ are $7, 14, 21, \\ldots, 994$.  The positive integers less than $1000$ that are multiples of $8$ are $8, 16, 24, \\ldots, 1000$.  The only positive integer less than $1000$ that is a multiple of both $7$ and $8$ is $56$.  Thus, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice is $1000 - (994 - 56 + 1) - (1000 - 56 + 1) + 1 = 1000 - 940 - 945 + 1 = 116$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{116}$.

        "ground_truth": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$."
