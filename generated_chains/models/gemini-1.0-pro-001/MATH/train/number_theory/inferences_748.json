        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",
        "inference": "The problem does not say anything about how long the pattern of counting continues for; it says the pattern only \\\"reverses\\\" after the stone originally counted as 1 is counted as 17. Thus there are only 17 numbers in the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 17. The first and last digits are 1 and 17, respectively. Since the pattern continues on both sides, we have 1 and 17 on both sides, and numbers in between increase by 1 each time until the end. This gives a total of 9 numbers on the right side and 9 on the left side. The number counted as 99 is the 5th number from the side on the left side. Since the first number is 1, the 5th number is 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99."
