At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. What is the least number of stamps he can combine so the value of the stamps is 33 cents?",
        "inference": "Bryan needs to make 33 cents worth of postage using 3-cent stamps and 4-cent stamps. \n1. Let's start with 3-cent stamps. He would need 11 of them to make 33 cents. However, he only has 10, so that won't work. \n2. Next, let's try 4-cent stamps. He would need 8 of them to make 33 cents. However, he only has 7, so that won't work either. \n3. Let's combine the two types of stamps. He can use 7 of the 4-cent stamps, which is 28 cents. Then he can add 1 of the 3-cent stamps to make a total of 33 cents.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps."
