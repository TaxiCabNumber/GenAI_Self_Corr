At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $12_a$ in one base and $21_b$ in another base, where $a$ and $b$ are any bases larger than 2?",
        "inference": "Let's consider the smallest possible value of $a$ and $b$, which is $a=3$ and $b=4$.\n\nIn base 3, $12_3 = 1 \\times 3^1 + 2 \\times 3^0 = 5$.\n\nIn base 4, $21_4 = 2 \\times 4^1 + 1 \\times 4^0 = 9$.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the integer is $9$.\n\nHowever, we can check if there is a smaller value by increasing $a$ and $b$.\n\nFor $a=4$ and $b=5$, we have:\n\n$12_4 = 1 \\times 4^1 + 2 \\times 4^0 = 6$\n\n$21_5 = 2 \\times 5^1 + 1 \\times 5^0 = 11$\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the integer is $6$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.

Since $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 2, we'll let $b=3$ and that means $a=2\\cdot3-1=5$. In these bases, the base-10 integer is $a+2=5+2=\\boxed{7}$. We can check that the base-$b$ expression also works and get $2\\cdot b+1=2\\cdot3+1=7$.\n\nAlternatively, we can just try different bases. The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 3. If we let $a=3$, we'd need a smaller base for $b$ (since we have $2\\cdot b\\approx1\\cdot a$), which isn't possible. When we let $b=3$, we get $21_3=7$ and try to find $b$ such that $12_b=7$. If $b+2=7$, then $b=5$ and we still get $\\boxed{7}$."
