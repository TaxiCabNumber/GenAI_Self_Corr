        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** \nThe five numbers that are visible are \n$$1, 2, 3, 4, \\text{ and } 6.$$\n\nThe largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is the least common multiple of these five numbers, which is \n$$6 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 36.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{36}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number."
