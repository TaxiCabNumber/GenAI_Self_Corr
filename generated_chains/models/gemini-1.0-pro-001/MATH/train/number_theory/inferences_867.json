At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

There are 69 multiples of 5 between 1 and 349 inclusive. However, we have counted 10 multiples of 10 twice, so the total number of multiples of 2 or 5 between 1 and 349 inclusive is $174 + 69 - 10 = 233$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{233}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal."
