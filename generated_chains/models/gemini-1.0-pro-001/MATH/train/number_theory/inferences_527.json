        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
        "inference": "Let the amount owed be \\(x = 210k + 300m\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers.\n\nTo resolve the debt, we need to find a number \\(n\\) such that\n$$x - 210n = 300p \\text{ for some integer }p.$$\n\nThis means that \\(x = 300(p + 210n)\\). Since \\(x = 210k + 300m\\), we have\n$$210k + 300m = 300(p + 210n).$$\n\nDividing both sides by 300, we get\n$$7k + 10m = p + 70n.$$\n\nSince \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers, \\(p + 70n\\) must also be an integer. This is only possible if \\(p\\) is a multiple of 7. Therefore, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way is\n$$x = 300(7 + 210n) = 2100 + 63000n.$$\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\), we get \\(x = 2100 + 63000 = 65100\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{65100}.\\) I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs."
