At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n",

Since $0 \\le a_2 \\le 99$ and $0 \\le a_1 \\le 99$, this is impossible.\n- If $a_3$ = 2, then $a_2\\cdot 10^2 + a_1\\cdot 10 + a_0$ must be 110 or 210.

There are 901 choices for this.\n\nSo the total number of ways to write 2010 in the given form is 3 + 1 + 901 = \\boxed{$905$}.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$905$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$."
