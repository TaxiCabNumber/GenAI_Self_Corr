At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $m$ be the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11). Let $n$ be the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11). What is $n-m$?",
        "inference": "Since $m$ is the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), $m$ is the remainder when 100 is divided by 11. $100 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ since $5\\cdot 20 \\equiv 100 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $m = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nSince $n$ is the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), $n$ is the remainder when 1000 is divided by 11. $1000 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ since $5\\cdot 200 \\equiv 1000 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $n-m = \\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$."
