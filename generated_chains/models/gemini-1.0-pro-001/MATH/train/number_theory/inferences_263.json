        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince both $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ end with $5$, their sum $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ also ends with $5$.\n\nThe smallest prime divisor of any number ending with $5$ must be $5$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum."
