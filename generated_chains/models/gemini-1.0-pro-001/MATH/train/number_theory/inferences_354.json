At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what base is the representation of $285_{10}$ a four digit number whose final digit is odd?",
        "inference": "Let the base be $b$.\n\nThen, $285_{10} = a_3b^3 + a_2b^2 + a_1b + a_0$, where $a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 < b$.\n\nSince the last digit is odd, $a_0$ must be odd.\n\nSince $285_{10} = 2 \\cdot 10^2 + 8 \\cdot 10^1 + 5 \\cdot 10^0$, we have:\n\n$a_3 = 2, a_2 = 8, a_1 = 5, a_0 = 5$.\n\nTherefore, $285_{10} = 2b^3 + 8b^2 + 5b + 5$.\n\nFor $285_{10}$ to be a four digit number, we must have $b^3 + b^2 > 100$.\n\nThe smallest base that satisfies this inequality is $b = 5$.\n\nTherefore, the base is $5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$.

        "ground_truth": "$285_{10}$ is only four digits for bases 5 and 6, since only these two bases satisfy $b^{4}>285_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. Testing each of our two cases, we find that $285_{10}= 2120_{5} = 1153_{6}$, so only base $\\boxed{6}$ yields a four-digit representation with an odd units digit."
