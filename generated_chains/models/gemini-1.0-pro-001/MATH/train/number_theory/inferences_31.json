At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?",
        "inference": "Let \\(a\\) be the least whole number divisible by 7 but leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6. Then \\(a + 1\\) will be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\nThe least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is 420. Therefore, \\(a + 1\\) is a multiple of 420. The smallest multiple of 420 that is greater than 1 is 420 itself. So, \\(a + 1 = 420\\). Hence, \\(a = 419\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$419$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$."
