At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ are divisible by 45?",
        "inference": "- The number $\\_\\_45$ is divisible by 45 if and only if it is divisible by both 5 and 9.\n- To be divisible by 5, the last digit must be 0 or 5.\n- To be divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of the digits is 9, which is divisible by 9.\n- Therefore, the only possible four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45 are 1445 and 6445.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them."
