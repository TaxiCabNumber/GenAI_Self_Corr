I hope it is correct.'\nThe Lucas sequence is the sequence 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, $\\ldots$ where the first term is 1, the second term is 3 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8?",
        "inference": "First, let's find the 100th term of the Lucas sequence. We can do this using the formula for the nth term of the Lucas sequence:\n\nLucas(n) = (\u03b1^n - \u03b2^n) / (\u03b1 - \u03b2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = (1 + \u221a5) / 2 and \u03b2 = (1 - \u221a5) / 2.\n\nSubstituting n = 100, we get:\n\nLucas(100) = ((1 + \u221a5)^100 - (1 - \u221a5)^100) / ((1 + \u221a5) - (1 - \u221a5))\n= (1 + \u221a5)^100 - (1 - \u221a5)^100 / \u221a5\n= (1 + \u221a5)^100 - (1 - \u221a5)^100 / \u221a5 * \u221a5 / \u221a5\n= (1 + \u221a5)^100 - (1 - \u221a5)^100 / 5\n\nNow, let's find the remainder when Lucas(100) is divided by 8. We can do this by reducing the numerator and denominator modulo 8:\n\nLucas(100) \u2261 ((1 + \u221a5)^100 - (1 - \u221a5)^100) / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 ((3^100 - 2^100) / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 ((-1)^100 * 3^100 - 2^100) / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 (3^100 - 2^100) / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 (1 - 4) / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 -3 / 5 (mod 8)\n\u2261 5 (mod 8)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the Lucas sequence is divided by 8 is 5.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can look at the terms of the Lucas sequence modulo 8.   \\begin{align*}\nL_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_2 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_3 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_4 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_5 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_6 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_8 &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_9 &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{10} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{11} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{12} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{14} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{15} &\\equiv 4\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nL_{16} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}Since $L_{13}=1$ and $L_{14}=3$, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.  Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $L_{100}\\equiv L_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $L_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{7}$."
