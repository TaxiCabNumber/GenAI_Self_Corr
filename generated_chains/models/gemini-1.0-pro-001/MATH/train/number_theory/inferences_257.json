At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integers $n$ between 1 and 11 (inclusive) is $\\frac{n}{12}$ a repeating decimal?",
        "inference": "Since $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal if and only if $n$ is not divisible by 12, we need to find the number of integers between 1 and 11 (inclusive) that are not divisible by 12.\nThe only integers between 1 and 11 that are divisible by 12 are 6 and 12. So, there are $11-2 = \\boxed{9}$ integers between 1 and 11 (inclusive) that are not divisible by 12.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal."
