At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmily ordered her playing cards by suit in the order $$A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2,3,\\cdots.$$What is the $42$nd card?",
        "inference": "Since Emily ordered her cards by suit in the order $A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K$, there are $13$ cards in each suit. Therefore, the $42$nd card will be the $3$rd card in the third suit.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$."
