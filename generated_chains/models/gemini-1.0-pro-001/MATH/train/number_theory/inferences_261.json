        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe greatest whole number less than $100$ is $99$.\n\n**Case 1:** $99$ is prime, so it has only $2$ positive factors: $1$ and $99$.\n\n**Case 2:** $99$ is not prime. Then it is a product of two smaller numbers.\n\n**Subcase 2A:** $99$ is a product of two prime numbers, $a$ and $b$. Then it has the following positive factors:\n\n* $1$\n* $a$\n* $b$\n* $99$\n\nFor this to be an odd number, we must have $a=b=3$, so $99=3\\cdot 3=9$.\n\n**Subcase 2B:** $99$ is a product of a prime number and a composite number, $a$ and $b$. Then it has the following positive factors:\n\n* $1$\n* $a$\n* $b$\n* $ab$\n* $99$\n\nFor this to be an odd number, we must have $a=3$ and $b=11$, so $99=3\\cdot 11$.\n\n**Subcase 2C:** $99$ is a product of two composite numbers, $a$ and $b$. Then it has the following positive factors:\n\n* $1$\n* $a$\n* $b$\n* $ab$\n* $99$\n\nFor this to be an odd number, we must have $a=9$ and $b=11$, so $99=9\\cdot 11$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the greatest whole number less than $100$ that has an odd number of positive factors is $\\boxed{99}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{99}$.

        "ground_truth": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$."
