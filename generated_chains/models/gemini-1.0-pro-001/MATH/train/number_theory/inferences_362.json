        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many more digits does the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ have than the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$?",
        "inference": "**1. Converting 987 to base-3**\n987 \u00f7 3 = 329 R 0\n329 \u00f7 3 = 109 R 2\n109 \u00f7 3 = 36 R 2\n36 \u00f7 3 = 12 R 0\n12 \u00f7 3 = 4 R 0\n4 \u00f7 3 = 1 R 1\n1 \u00f7 3 = 0 R 1\n\nTherefore, $987_{10} = 1120200_3$.\n\n**2.

Therefore, the difference in the number of digits is 6 - 3 = 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent."
