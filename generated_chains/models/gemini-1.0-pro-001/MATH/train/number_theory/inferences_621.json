I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n",

Since $\\frac{n}{100}$ is not an integer, $S_i$ contains no perfect square if and only if $i$ is not an integer. There are 1000 values of $i$ from $0$ to $999$, and $i$ is an integer only if $100$ divides $i$. Since $100$ has $2$ prime factors, and prime numbers do not divide each other, $i$ is divisible by $100$ if and only if $i$ is divisible by $10^2 = 100$. Therefore, $i$ is divisible by $100$ if and only if $i$ is divisible by $10$. There are $1000$ integers from $0$ to $999$, and $i$ is divisible by $10$ if and only if the last digit of $i$ is $0$. Therefore, there are $100$ values of $i$ from $0$ to $999$ that are divisible by $10$. Since there are $1000$ values of $i$ from $0$ to $999$, there are $1000 - 100 = 900$ values of $i$ from $0$ to $999$ that are not divisible by $10$. Therefore, there are $900$ sets $S_i$ from $S_0$ to $S_{999}$ that do not contain a perfect square.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{900}.$ I hope it is correct.",

Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square."
