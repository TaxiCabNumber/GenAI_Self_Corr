At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can 1995 be factored as a product of two two-digit numbers? (Two factorizations of the form $a\\cdot b$ and $b\\cdot a$ are considered the same).",
        "inference": "Thinking step by step:\n1. First, find all the two-digit factors of 1995. These are: \n$$15, 105, 133$$\n2. Next, for each factor, find its pair that multiplies to 1995. These are:\n$$15 \\cdot 133$$\n$$105\\cdot 19$$\n3. Since the order of the factors does not matter, we have the following factorizations:\n$$15\\cdot 133$$\n$$133 \\cdot 15$$\n$$105 \\cdot 19$$\n$$19 \\cdot 105$$\n4. Thus, there are $\\boxed{4}$ ways to factor 1995 as a product of two two-digit numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$1995=5\\cdot399=3\\cdot5\\cdot133=3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot19$. Since $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=105$ has three digits, in any expression of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers, $19$ must be a proper factor of one of them. $19\\cdot3=57$ and $19\\cdot5=95$ are two-digit numbers that are divisible by $19$ and divide $1995$, but $19\\cdot7=133$ and $19\\cdot3\\cdot5=285$ are three digits, so the only possible expressions of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers are $57\\cdot35$ and $95\\cdot21$. So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such factorizations."
