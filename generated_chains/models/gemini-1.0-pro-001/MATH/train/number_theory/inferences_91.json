        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor $1 \\le n \\le 100$, how many integers are there such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal?",
        "inference": "Since $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal, $n$ must not be divisible by $5$ or $2$.  So $n$ must be odd.  Since $1 \\le n \\le 100$, there are $50$ such integers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals."
