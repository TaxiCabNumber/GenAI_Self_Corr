        "inference": "The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. To form a perfect square, we must choose an even number of each of the prime factors. We have 4 twos, 3 threes, and 1 five. Choosing 2 twos, 2 threes, and 0 fives gives one perfect square factor. Choosing 4 twos, 0 threes, and 0 fives gives another perfect square factor. Choosing 0 twos, 2 threes, and 0 fives gives a third perfect square factor. Choosing 0 twos, 0 threes, and 0 fives gives a fourth perfect square factor.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160."
