        "inference": "Since $k$ has remainder $1$ when divided by $17,$ $6,$ and $2,$ we must have that $k=17a+1,$ $k=6b+1,$ and $k=2c+1$ for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ Solving the first equation for $k,$ we get $k=17a+1.$ Substituting this into the second equation, we get $17a+1=6b+1,$ which gives $17a=6b.$ Since $6$ and $17$ are relatively prime, we must have that $a=3m$ and $b=5m$ for some integer $m.$ Substituting these expressions for $a$ and $b$ into the first equation, we get $k=17(3m)+1=51m+1.$ Now, we can substitute this expression for $k$ into the third equation and solve for $m:$\n\n$$51m+1=2c+1\\Rightarrow 51m=2c\\Rightarrow m=\\frac{2c}{51}.$$Since $c$ is an integer, $m$ must be an integer. Therefore, $c=51n$ for some integer $n.$ Substituting this expression for $c$ into the third equation, we get $k=51m+1=51\\left(\\frac{2}{51}n\\right)+1=2n+1.$ Since $k$ must be greater than $1,$ we must have that $n>0.$ Therefore, $k=\\boxed{3}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
