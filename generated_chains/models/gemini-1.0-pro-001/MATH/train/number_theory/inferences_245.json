At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 100 are both a square and a cube?",
        "inference": "A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. The first few perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, and 1000.\n\nA perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. The first few perfect squares are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.\n\nThe only number less than 100 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect square is 64.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube."
