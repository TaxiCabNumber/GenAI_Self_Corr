        "ground_truth": "Divide the first congruence by 7, remembering to divide 14 by $\\text{gcf}(7,14)=7$ as well. We find that the first congruence is equivalent to $x \\equiv 1\\pmod{2}$. Subtracting 13 from both sides and multiplying both sides by 5 (which is the modular inverse of 2, modulo 9) gives $x\\equiv 6\\pmod{9}$ for the second congruence. Finally, adding $2x$ to both sides in the third congruence and multiplying by 17 (which is the modular inverse of 3, modulo 25) gives $x\\equiv 17\\pmod{25}$. So we want to solve  \\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{9} \\\\\nx &\\equiv 17 \\pmod{25}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}Let's first find a simultaneous solution for the second and third congruences.  We begin checking numbers which are 17 more than a multiple of 25, and we quickly find that 42 is congruent to 17 (mod 25) and 6 (mod 9). Since 42 does not satisfy the first congruence we look to the next solution $42+\\text{lcm}(25,9)=267$. Now we have found a solution for the system, so we can appeal to the Chinese Remainder Theorem to conclude that the general solution of the system is $x\\equiv 267 \\pmod{450}$, where 450 is obtained by taking the least common multiple of 2, 9, and 25. So the least four-digit solution is $267 + 450 (2) = \\boxed{1167}$."
