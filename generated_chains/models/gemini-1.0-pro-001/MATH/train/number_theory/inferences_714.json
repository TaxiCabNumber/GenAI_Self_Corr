At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210?",

The sum of the positive whole number divisors of 210 is:\n$$(1+2)\\times(1+3)\\times(1+5)\\times(1+7)=280$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{280}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $210$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. It follows that the sum of the divisors of $210$ is equal to $(1 + 2)(1 + 3)(1+5)(1+7)$, as each factor of $210$ is represented when the product is expanded. It follows that the answer is equal to $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{576}$."
