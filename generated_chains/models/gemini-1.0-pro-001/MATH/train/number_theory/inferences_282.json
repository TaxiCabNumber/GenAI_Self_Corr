        "inference": "**Step 1**. Since the remainder when dividing by 5 is 4, the number must be of the form 5k + 4, where k is an integer.\n\n**Step 2**. Since the remainder when dividing by 6 is 5, the number must be of the form 6m + 5, where m is an integer. So 5k + 4 = 6m + 5.\n\n**Step 3**. Since the remainder when dividing by 7 is 6, the number must be of the form 7n + 6, where n is an integer. So 6m + 5 = 7n + 6.\n\n**Step 4**. Since the remainder when dividing by 8 is 7, the number must be of the form 8p + 7, where p is an integer. So 7n + 6 = 8p + 7.\n\n**Step 5**. Since the remainder when dividing by 9 is 8, the number must be of the form 9q + 8, where q is an integer. So 8p + 7 = 9q + 8.\n\n**Step 6**. Since the remainder when dividing by 10 is 9, the number must be of the form 10r + 9, where r is an integer. So 9q + 8 = 10r + 9.\n\n**Step 7**. Solving this system of equations, we get k = 39, m = 34, n = 29, p = 24, q = 19, and r = 14.\n\n**Step 8**. Therefore, the number is 5k + 4 = 5(39) + 4 = 204.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$204$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$."
