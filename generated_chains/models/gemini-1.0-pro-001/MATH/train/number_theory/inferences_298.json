        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $555_{10}$ is expressed in this base, it has 4 digits, in the form ABAB, where A and B are two different digits.  What base is it?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe have \n$$555_{10}=100A+10B+A+B=101A+11B.$$  We also have \n$$555_{10}=a_3a_2a_1a_0$$  Then, \n$$101A+11B=a_3b+a_2b^{10}+a_1b^{100}+a_0b^{1000}$$  Since $101A+11B$ has no $b^2$ term, $a_1=a_3=0$.  Since $101A+11B$ has no $b$ term, $a_0=a_2=0$.  Thus, $555_{10}=11B$.  So, $B=5$, and $555_{10}=115_b$.  The base is $\\boxed{b=6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{b=6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, let us find which bases result in $555_{10}$ having four digits. We must find base b such that $b^{4}>555_{10}\\geq b^{3}$. We easily determine that b can range from 5 to 8, inclusive.  We can now try each of these four bases to see which yields a number in the form ABAB.  For base six, we find that $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 555 only two times at most, leaving $555-2\\cdot216 = 123$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 123 three times at most, leaving us with $123-3\\cdot36 = 15$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 15 two times at most, leaving $15-2\\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. So, the base $\\boxed{6}$ equivalent of $555_{10}$ is $2323_{6}$, which satisfies all of the requirements stated."
