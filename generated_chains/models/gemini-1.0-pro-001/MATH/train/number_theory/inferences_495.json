        "inference": "The prime factorization of $8n^3$ is $2^3 \\cdot n^3$.  Since $n$ is odd, the prime factorization of $n$ contains no $2$'s.  Thus, the prime factorization of $8n^3$ is $2^3 \\cdot n^3 \\cdot p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ where $p_1, \\ldots, p_k$ are distinct odd primes.  The number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is therefore $(3 + 1)(a_1 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1) = 4(a_1 + 1) \\cdots (a_k + 1)$.  Since $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, $a_1 + 1 \\cdots (a_k + 1) = 10$.  There are several ways to write 10 as a product of positive integers.  The only choice with exactly $k$ factors is $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$.  Thus, $k = 2$, $a_1 = 1$, and $a_2 = 4$.  The number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is therefore $4(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) = 4(2)(5) = \\boxed{40}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$"
