        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?",
        "inference": "The units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is the same as the units digit of the product of the units digits of the integers. Since the integers are all odd, the units digits can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.\n\nThe factors of the final product are:\n$$ 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 945$$\nThe product of all these units digits is 315. The units digit of this product is 5 since\n$$3\\times 5\\times 9 = 135,$$ \nand the units digit of 135 is 5. \nTherefore the final answer is:\n$$\\text{Final Answer: }\\boxed{5}.$$",
        "ground_truth": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$."
