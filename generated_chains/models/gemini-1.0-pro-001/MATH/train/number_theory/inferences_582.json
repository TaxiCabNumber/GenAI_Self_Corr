At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number $r$ can be expressed as a four-place decimal $0.abcd,$ where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ represent digits, any of which could be zero. It is desired to approximate $r$ by a fraction whose numerator is 1 or 2 and whose denominator is an integer. The closest such fraction to $r$ is $\\frac 27.$ What is the number of possible values for $r$?\n",

Since there are two choices for $a$ and two choices for $b,$ there are $2\\cdot 2=4$ possible values for $ab.$\n\nFor any such value of $ab,$ there are $10$ choices for $c$ and $10$ choices for $d,$ so there are $10\\cdot 10=100$ possible values for $abcd.$ Thus, there are $4\\cdot 100=\\boxed{400}$ possible values for $r.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{400}.$ I hope it is correct.",
