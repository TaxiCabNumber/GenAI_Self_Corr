At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor some positive integer $k$, when 60 is divided by $k^2$, the remainder is 6. What is the remainder when 100 is divided by $k$?",
        "inference": "Let \\(k\\) be the divisor. According to the division algorithm, there exist unique integers \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\(60=k^2q+r\\), where \\(0\\leq r<k^2\\). Since the remainder is 6, we have \\(r=6\\).\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as \\(k^2q=60-r=60-6=54\\). Since \\(k^2\\) is a perfect square, \\(54\\) must be a perfect square. The only perfect square factor of \\(54\\) is \\(9\\).

        "ground_truth": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$."
