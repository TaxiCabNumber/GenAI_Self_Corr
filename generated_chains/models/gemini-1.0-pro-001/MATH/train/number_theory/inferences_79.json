At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The expression $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer if and only if $2n - 1$ is a factor of $20$. The factors of $20$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$. The only factors of $20$ that are of the form $2n - 1$ are $1$ and $5$. Therefore, the only integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer are $1$ and $3$. The sum of these two values is $1 + 3 = 4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$."
