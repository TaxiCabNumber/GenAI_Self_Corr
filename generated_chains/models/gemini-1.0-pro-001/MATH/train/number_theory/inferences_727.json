At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the least positive integer that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.\n\nWhen $x$ is divided by 2, the remainder is 0 because $x$ is even.\n\nWhen $x$ is divided by 3, the remainder is 1 because $x$ is of the form $3k+1$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWhen $x$ is divided by 4, the remainder is 2 because $x$ is of the form $4k+2$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTherefore, $x$ must be a number that is of the form $3k+1$ and also of the form $4k+2$. This means that $x$ must be a multiple of both 3 and 4.\n\nThe least multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. Therefore, the least positive integer that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $12$.
