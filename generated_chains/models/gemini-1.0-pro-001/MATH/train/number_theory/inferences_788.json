At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $p$ is prime and $1007_p+306_p+113_p+125_p+6_p=142_p+271_p+360_p$. How many possible values of $p$ are there?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFirst, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by grouping the terms with the same base:\n$$1007_p+306_p+113_p+125_p+6_p=(1000_p+7_p)+(300_p+6_p)+(100_p+10_p+3_p)+(100_p+20_p+5_p)+(1_p+5_p+0_p)=1117_p+406_p+113_p+125_p+6_p.$$\n\nNext, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation in the same way:\n$$142_p+271_p+360_p=(100_p+40_p+2_p)+(200_p+70_p+1_p)+(300_p+60_p+0_p)=442_p+341_p+360_p.$$\n\nNow we have the equation $1117_p+406_p+113_p+125_p+6_p=442_p+341_p+360_p$. Subtracting $341_p+360_p$ from both sides, we get $1117_p+406_p+113_p+125_p-341_p-360_p=442_p-341_p-360_p$, which simplifies to $1219_p=81_p$. Dividing both sides by $81_p$, we get $1219_p\\div81_p=81_p\\div81_p$, which simplifies to $15=1$. This is a contradiction, so there are no possible values of $p$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$0$}.

But the only prime solutions of this can be factors of $24$, i.e. $2$ and $3$. But $7$ is not a digit in base $2$ or $3$, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible $p$!\n\nRemark: $2$ and $3$ are, in fact, roots of this polynomial."
