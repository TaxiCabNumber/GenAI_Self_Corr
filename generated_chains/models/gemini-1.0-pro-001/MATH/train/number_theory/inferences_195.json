        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
        "inference": "The terms of the sequence are multiples of 3 that have a 1 in them.\n\nEvery third positive integer is a multiple of 3.\n\nThe first positive integer with a 1 in it is 11.\n\nEvery ninth positive integer starting with 11 has a 1 in it.\n\nSo, the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is the $17^{\\mathrm{th}}$ multiple of 3 that has a 1 in it.\n\nThe $17^{\\mathrm{th}}$ multiple of 3 is $17\\times3=51$.\n\nThe $17^{\\mathrm{th}}$ multiple of 3 that has a 1 in it is $51$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{51}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$."
