        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
        "inference": "1. Ami throws the ball to the fifth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n2. The fifth girl throws the ball to the ninth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n3. The ninth girl throws the ball to the second girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n4. The second girl throws the ball to the sixth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n5. The sixth girl throws the ball to the tenth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n6. The tenth girl throws the ball to the third girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n7. The third girl throws the ball to the seventh girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n8. The seventh girl throws the ball to the eleventh girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n9. The eleventh girl throws the ball to the fourth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n10. The fourth girl throws the ball to the eighth girl, skipping 3 girls: 1 throw\n\n11. The eighth girl throws the ball to Ami: 1 throw\n\nTotal throws: 11\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{11}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami."
