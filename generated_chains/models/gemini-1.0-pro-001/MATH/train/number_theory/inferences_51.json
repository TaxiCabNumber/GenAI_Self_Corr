        "inference": "Let $n$ be the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$. Then there exist integers $m$ and $k$ such that\n\n$$n=23m\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad n=89k+4.$$Equating the two expressions for $n$, we get $$23m=89k+4\\Rightarrow 23m-89k=4.$$Since $23$ and $89$ are relatively prime, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $$23x+89y=1.$$Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, we get $$92x+356y=4\\Rightarrow 92x=4-356y\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{4-356y}{92}.$$Since $x$ is an integer, $4-356y$ must be divisible by $92$. Since $92=2^2\\cdot23$, we must have $4-356y$ is divisible by $4$ and $23$. Since $4-356y$ is divisible by $4$, $y$ must be even. Since $4-356y$ is divisible by $23$, $y$ must be divisible by $23$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $4$ and $23$ is $4\\cdot23=92$. Therefore, $y=92z$ for some integer $z$. Substituting this into the equation $4-356y=92x$, we get $$4-356(92z)=92x\\Rightarrow 4-32768z=92x\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{4-32768z}{92}.$$Since $x$ is an integer, $4-32768z$ must be divisible by $92$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $92$ is $92$. Therefore, $z=0$. Substituting this into the equation $y=92z$, we get $y=0$. Substituting this into the equation $n=89k+4$, we get $$n=89k+4\\Rightarrow n=89\\cdot0+4=\\boxed{4}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek. Thus $$23a\\equiv 4\\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \\begin{align*}\n92a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89} \\\\\n3a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \\begin{align*}\n90a &\\equiv 480 \\pmod{89} \\\\\na &\\equiv 480-445 = 35 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence.
