        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits of a two-digit number $AB$ are reversed to form a second two-digit number, and the lesser of the two-digit numbers is subtracted from the greater. What prime number must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$?",
        "inference": "If $A\\neq B$, then the difference between the two-digit numbers is $99 (B - A)$. The prime factors of $99$ are $3$ and $11$. Since $3$ divides $A(10 + B)$ and $B(10 + A)$, $3$ is a factor of the difference. Therefore, $11$ must be a factor of the difference.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$AB -BA= 10\\cdot A+B - (10\\cdot B+A)= 9\\cdot A-9\\cdot B=3(3\\cdot A-3\\cdot B)$. If $A\\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$."
