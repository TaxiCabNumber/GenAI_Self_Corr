A number is a multiple of 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd places and the sum of its digits in the even places is a multiple of 11. In the given number $5d5,\\!22e$, the sum of the digits in the odd places is $5 + d + 2 + e = 7 + d + e$, and the sum of the digits in the even places is $5 + 2 = 7$. Therefore, we have $7 + d + e - 7 = d + e$, which must be a multiple of 11. The only possible values of $d + e$ that are multiples of 11 are $11$ and $22$. Since $d$ and $e$ are digits, we have $d + e = 11$. Therefore, $d = 5$ and $e = 6$. The maximum value of $d$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",

Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$."
