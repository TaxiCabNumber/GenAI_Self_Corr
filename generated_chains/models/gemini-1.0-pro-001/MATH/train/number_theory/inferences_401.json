        "inference": "The four smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. To be divisible by 2 and 5, the number must end in 0. To be divisible by 3, the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. To be divisible by 7, the last digit minus twice the next-to-last digit plus three times the third-to-last digit minus four times the fourth-to-last digit must be divisible by 7.\n\nThe smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1000. The sum of the digits of 1000 is 1, so it is not divisible by 3. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1010. The sum of the digits of 1010 is 2, so it is not divisible by 3. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1020. The sum of the digits of 1020 is 3, so it is divisible by 3.\n\nTo check if 1020 is divisible by 7, we can use the formula above:\n\n```\n1020 - 2 * 0 + 3 * 2 - 4 * 1 = 10\n```\n\nSince 10 is not divisible by 7, 1020 is not divisible by 7. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1030. The sum of the digits of 1030 is 4, so it is not divisible by 3. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1040. The sum of the digits of 1040 is 5, so it is divisible by 3.\n\nTo check if 1040 is divisible by 7, we can use the formula above:\n\n```\n1040 - 2 * 4 + 3 * 0 - 4 * 1 = 14\n```\n\nSince 14 is not divisible by 7, 1040 is not divisible by 7. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1050. The sum of the digits of 1050 is 6, so it is not divisible by 3. The next smallest four-digit number that ends in 0 is 1060. The sum of the digits of 1060 is 7, so it is divisible by 3.\n\nTo check if 1060 is divisible by 7, we can use the formula above:\n\n```\n1060 - 2 * 6 + 3 * 0 - 4 * 1 = 28\n```\n\nSince 28 is divisible by 7, 1060 is divisible by 7. Therefore, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers is 1060.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1060}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$."
