        "inference": "Solution:\nWe want to find the largest $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$.\n\nWe know that $2004! = 2004 \\times 2003 \\times \\cdots \\times 1$.\n\nSince $2004^k$ divides $2004!$, we have that $2004^k$ is a factor of each term in the product $2004 \\times 2003 \\times \\cdots \\times 1$.\n\nTherefore, $2004^k$ must be a factor of $2004$.\n\nSince $2004 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 167$, we have that $2004^k = (2^2)^k \\times 3^k \\times 167^k$.\n\nTherefore, $2004^k$ is a factor of $2004$ if and only if $k \\geq 2$.\n\nTherefore, the largest $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$ is $k = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher. The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\\tfrac{2004}{167} = \\boxed{12}$, the answer."
