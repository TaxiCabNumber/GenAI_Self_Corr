At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits, starting from the right, is divisible by 11.\n\nFor $854n526$, the alternating sum of its digits is:\n\n$6 - 2 + 5 - n + 4 - 5 + 8 = 16 - n$\n\nSince $16 - n$ must be divisible by 11, we have:\n\n$16 - n = 11k$, where $k$ is an integer\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n$n = 16 - 11k$\n\nSince $n$ is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. The smallest value of $k$ that gives a valid value for $n$ is $k = 1$, which gives $n = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$."
