        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?",
        "inference": "- Since she places a ball in the first available box at each step, each ball will get placed in a box to the right of the ball placed in the previous step.\n- Therefore, balls placed in step $1$ are in the first box, balls placed in step $2$ are in the second box, and so on.\n- In step $2010$, she will place the ball in the $2010$th box.\n- The only box which can not be emptied at this time is the first box because there is no box on its left to take out the balls. So, the first box has $1$ ball in it at the end of $2010$ steps.\n- The second box was emptied at the time when she put the second ball into the third box. So, the second box has $0$ balls in it at the end of $2010$ steps.\n- Similarly, the third box, fourth box, ..., and up to the $2010$th box has $0, 1, 2, ..., 2009$ balls in it respectively at the end of $2010$ steps.\n- Therefore, the total number of balls in the boxes is $1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 2009 = 1 + \\frac{2009 \\times 2010}{2} = 2019045$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2019045}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$."
