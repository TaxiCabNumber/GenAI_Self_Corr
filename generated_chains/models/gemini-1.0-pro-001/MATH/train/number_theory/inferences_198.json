        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday. School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSeptember has 30 days, so there are 4 complete weeks (28 days) in September. Since school begins on Monday, the last 2 days in September are Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nOctober has 31 days, so there are 4 complete weeks (28 days) in October. Since the last 2 days in September were Tuesday and Wednesday, the first 3 days in October are Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. This gives us 4 Mondays in October.\n\nNovember has 30 days, so there are 4 complete weeks (28 days) in November. Since the last day in October was Saturday, the first day in November is Sunday. This gives us 4 Mondays in November.\n\nTherefore, the fifth Monday after school starts occurs in **November**. Since the first day in November is Sunday, the fifth Monday is **November 6**.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{November \\ 6}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$."
