        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many bases between two and nine inclusive does the representation of $576_{10}$ have a final digit of 1?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIf a number has a final digit of 1, then it must be odd. The only bases between 2 and 9 that are odd are 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ bases in which the representation of $576_{10}$ has a final digit of 1.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For 576 to have a final digit of 1 when represented in base $b$, we must have that $576-1$ is divisible by $b$. To see this, note that any integer whose base-$b$ representation ends in 0 is divisible by $b$, just as any integer whose decimal representation ends in 0 is divisible by 10.  Since $575 = 5^2 \\cdot 23$, the only base which satisfies the given condition is 5.  Therefore, there is $\\boxed{1}$ such base."
