At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number $101$ is the smallest three-digit palindromic prime. What is the second-smallest one?",
        "inference": "101 is the smallest three-digit palindromic prime so the second-smallest one must be greater than 101. The next prime number greater than 101 is 103. We check if 103 is a palindrome: \n$$103=1\\times 10^2+0\\times 10^1+3\\times 10^0$$\n$$301=3\\times 10^2+0\\times 10^1+1\\times 10^0$$\nSince $103\\neq301$, 103 is not a palindrome. The next prime number greater than 103 is 107. We check if 107 is a palindrome: \n$$107=1\\times 10^2+0\\times 10^1+7\\times 10^0$$\n$$701=7\\times 10^2+0\\times 10^1+1\\times 10^0$$\nSince $107=701$, 107 is a palindrome. So, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime is 107.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{107}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$."
