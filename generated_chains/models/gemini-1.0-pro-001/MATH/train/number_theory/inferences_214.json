At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers between $500$ and $1000$ contain both the digits $3$ and $4$?",
        "inference": "The smallest number between $500$ and $1000$ containing both the digits $3$ and $4$ is $534$ and the largest is $943$. Therefore, the total number of such numbers is\n\n$$943-534+1=\\boxed{410}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{410}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number."
