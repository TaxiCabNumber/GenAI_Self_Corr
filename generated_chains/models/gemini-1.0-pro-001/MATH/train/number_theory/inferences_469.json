        "inference": "1. When a number is divided by another, the remainder cannot be greater than the divisor. \n2. In this case, the divisor is 47, so the remainder cannot be greater than 46. \n3. The remainders of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are already taken because 47 is divisible by these numbers. \n4. Therefore, the only possible remainder is 5. \n5. To find the counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we can add multiples of 47 to 5. \n6. The first multiple of 47 is 47 itself. \n7. Adding 47 to 5 gives us 52. \n8.
