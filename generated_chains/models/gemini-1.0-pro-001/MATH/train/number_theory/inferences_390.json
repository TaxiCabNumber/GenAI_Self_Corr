At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 100th letter in the pattern ABCABCABC...?",

The next three letters are the same as the first six, so they are also ABC. This pattern continues, so the 100th letter is the same as the 99th letter, which is the same as the 98th letter, and so on, until we reach the first letter of the pattern, which is A.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{A}.
