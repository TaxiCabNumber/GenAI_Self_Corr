At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne more than $11$ times a certain prime $p$ is another prime $q$. What is the value of $q$?",
        "inference": "Since $1$ more than $11$ times a certain prime $p$ is another prime $q$, we have $q=11p+1$. Since $q$ is prime, $11p$ is even. Since the only even prime is $2$, $p=2$. Therefore, $q=11p+1=11(2)+1=\\boxed{23}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{23}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$."
