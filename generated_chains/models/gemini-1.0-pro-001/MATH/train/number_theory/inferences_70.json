        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest number, all of whose digits are 3 or 2, and whose digits add up to $11$?",
        "inference": "The largest digit we can use is $3$ and we need to sum $11$. The only way to do this is to use three $3$'s and two $2$'s. Note that $33322$ is the largest possible number that meets these criteria.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33322}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$."
