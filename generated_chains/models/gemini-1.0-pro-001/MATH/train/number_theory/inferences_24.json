        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different positive values of $x$ will make this statement true: there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$.",
        "inference": "The smallest positive two-digit multiple of $x$ is $2x$ and the largest is $99x$.  The only way there can be exactly two positive two-digit multiples of $x$ is if $2x=100$ and $99x=101$.  This is impossible, so the answer is $0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).\n\nIt may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.  Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.\n\nNow, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive."
