Each box contains $13$ doughnuts.\n\nAfter eating one doughnut, Donna is able to rearrange the remaining doughnuts into bags so that each bag contains $9$ doughnuts, and none are left over. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
        "inference": "1. Each bag contains 9 doughnuts, so the total number of doughnuts in the bags is a multiple of 9.\n\n2. There are $13$ doughnuts in each box, so the total number of doughnuts in $n$ boxes is $13n$.\n\n3. Since the total number of doughnuts in the bags is a multiple of 9, $13n$ must also be a multiple of 9.\n\n4. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than or equal to $13$ is $18$.\n\n5. Therefore, $13n$ must be greater than or equal to $18$.\n\n6. The smallest value of $n$ that satisfies $13n \\ge 18$ is $n = 2$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At the beginning, there are $13n$ doughnuts. After $1$ doughnut is eaten, the number of remaining doughnuts is a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the original number of doughnuts was $1$ more than a multiple of $9$. Expressing this as a congruence, we have $$13n\\equiv 1\\pmod 9,$$or in other words, $n\\equiv 13^{-1}\\pmod 9$. Since $13\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$, we can also write $n\\equiv 4^{-1}\\pmod 9$.\n\nBecause $4\\cdot 7=28\\equiv 1$, we have $4^{-1}\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. Therefore, $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$. We know $n$ must be a nonnegative integer, so the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nWe can check our answer: If $n=7$, then Donna started with $7\\cdot 13=91$ doughnuts; after eating one, she had $90$, which is a multiple of $9$."
