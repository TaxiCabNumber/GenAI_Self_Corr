The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$.
