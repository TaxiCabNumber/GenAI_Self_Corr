At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, natural-number factors does $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ have?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ is $$4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4$$ The number of factors of $2^8$ is $8+1 = 9$. The number of factors of $3^2$ is $2+1 = 3$. The number of factors of $5^4$ is $4+1 = 5$. Therefore, the number of distinct, natural-number factors of $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ is $9 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{135}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}$. I hope it is correct.",
