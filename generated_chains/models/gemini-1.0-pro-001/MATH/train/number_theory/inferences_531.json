At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors?",

The smallest positive integer with four distinct prime factors is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7=210$.\n\n3. Therefore, the smallest positive integer with five distinct prime factors is $2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot11=2310$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2310}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$."
