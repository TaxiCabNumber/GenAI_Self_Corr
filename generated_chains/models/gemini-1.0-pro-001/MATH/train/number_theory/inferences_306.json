At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the 25th day of the year 2003 falls on a Saturday, on what day of the week did the 284th day of the year 2003 fall?",

The remaining 340 days are 48 weeks + 4 days, or 12 more Saturdays.\n\nThe total Saturdays in 2003 from Jan 1 to Dec 31 is 5 + 12 = 17.\n\nThe 284th day of the year is the 5th day of the 41st week, which is the 5th day after the 280th day of the year. The 280th day of the year is the 3rd day of the 40th week, which is a Saturday.\n\nTherefore, the 284th day of the year 2003 is the 5th day after the 280th day of the year, which is a **Wednesday**.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Wednesday}$.

        "ground_truth": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$."
