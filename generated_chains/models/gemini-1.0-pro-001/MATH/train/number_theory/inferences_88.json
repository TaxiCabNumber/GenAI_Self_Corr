At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive two-digit number is even and is a multiple of 11. The product of its digits is a perfect cube. What is this two-digit number?",
        "inference": "Let the number be $10x + y$, where $x$ and $y$ are digits and $x>y$.\n\nSince the number is even, $y$ is even.\n\nSince the number is a multiple of 11, $x - y = 11k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince the product of the digits is a perfect cube, $xy = z^3$ for some integer $z$.\n\nWe have $10x + y = 22k$ and $x - y = 11k$.\n\nAdding these two equations, we get $11x = 33k$.\n\nTherefore, $x = 3k$.\n\nSubstituting this into $x - y = 11k$, we get $y = -8k$.\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are digits, we have $k = 1$.\n\nTherefore, $x = 3$ and $y = -8$.\n\nSince $y$ is even, this is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there is no positive two-digit number that satisfies the given conditions.\nFinal Answer: $\\square$",
        "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the desired two-digit number. $N$ is divisible by 2 and by 11, and $(2,11)=1$, so $N$ is divisible by 22. Thus, $N\\in\\{22, 44, 66, 88\\}$. Only 88 is such that the product of its digits is a perfect cube ($8\\cdot8=64=4^3$), so $N=\\boxed{88}$."
