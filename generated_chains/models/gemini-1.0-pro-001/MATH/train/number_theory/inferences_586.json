At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "First, consider the values of $x$ that give integers for $y$. Solving for $y$ we have:\n\n$$ y = \\pm \\sqrt{x^2 - 2000^2}. $$\n\nFor $y$ to be an integer, $x^2 - 2000^2$ must be a perfect square. Since $x$ is an integer, the same is true of $x^2$. The only perfect square that is less than or equal to $2000^2$ is $1000^2$, so $x = 2000$ or $x = -2000$.\n\nNext, consider the lattice points on the left branch of the hyperbola, for $-2000 \\le x < 0$. These points have the form $(x,y)$ where $y = \\sqrt{x^2 - 2000^2}$. So the number of points on the left branch is equal to the number of perfect squares $n^2$ such that $2000 < n < 3000$. This is simply $3000 - 2000 = 1000$.\n\nThe same argument can be applied to the right branch, yielding $1000$ points. Thus, the total number of lattice points on the hyperbola is $2000$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2000}. I hope it is correct.",
