At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
        "inference": "$x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors that means they are all prime numbers. So $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = p^{2}q^{3}r^{4}$ where $p, q, r$ are distinct prime numbers. Thus, the number of factors of $p^{2}q^{3}r^{4} = (2 + 1)(3 + 1)(4 + 1) = 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors."
