        "inference": "The prime factorization of 72 is $$72 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$$.\nTherefore, the possible exponents for 2 and 3 in the prime factorization of a positive factor of 72 are: $$2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3$$ $$3^0, 3^1, 3^2$$\nTo be a perfect cube, the exponent for each prime factor must be divisible by 3. The only possible combination of exponents that satisfies this condition is: $$2^0 \\cdot 3^2 = 9$$\nTherefore, there is only one positive factor of 72 that is a perfect cube.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}.

        "ground_truth": "Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$.  A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72.  Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0).  There are $2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices."
