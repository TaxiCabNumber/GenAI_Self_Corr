Since $n$ divides $100^2a_{n-4}+n^2+198n-399$, so $n$ divides $100^2a_{n-4}+n^2+198n-399-99=100^2a_{n-4}+n^2+99n-498$.\n\nLet $m=n^2+99n-498$.  Then $m$ is an integer, and $100^2$ divides $m$.  The smallest positive $99$-multiple of $100^2$ is $100^2\\cdot 99=990000$.  It cannot happen that $m=990000$, because that would mean $n^2+99n=1488$, which has no solutions for $n$.  Therefore, $m$ is a multiple of $990000$.  The smallest positive integer multiple of $990000$ is $990000$.  Thus, $m=990000$, and so\n$$n^2+99n=1488.$$\nTherefore, $n^2+99n-1488=0$.  Factoring this quadratic expression gives $(n-33)(n+45)=0$, so $n=33$ or $n=-45$.  But $n>10$, so $n=33$.
