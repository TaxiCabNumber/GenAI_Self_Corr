        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when the product $1734\\times 5389 \\times 80,\\!607$ is divided by 10?",
        "inference": "$$1734\\times 5389 \\times 80,\\!607$$\n\nThe product of the last digits is 4, so the last digit of the given product is also 4. Thus, the remainder is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The remainder when a number is divided by 10 is simply the units digit of that number. So we only look for the units digit of the product. With $1734\\times 5389$, $4\\times9=36$, so the result will have a units digit of 6. Then we multiply 6 by the units digit of $80,607$ and get $6\\times7=42$. That means the final product will have a units digit of $\\boxed{2}$."
