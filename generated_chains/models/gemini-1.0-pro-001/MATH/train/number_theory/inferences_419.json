At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarcus has two numbers, $a$ and $b$.  When he divides $a$ by 45 he gets a remainder of 37.  When he divides $b$ by 30 he gets a remainder of $9$.  What remainder does he get when he divides $a+b$ by 15?",

Thus, \n$$a=45k+37$$\n\nfor some integer $k$.\n\nSimilarly, \n$$b=30m+9$$\n\nfor some integer $m$.\n\nThen\n$$\\begin{split} a+b &=45k+37+30m+9 \\\\\\ & =45k+30m+46  \\\\\\ &=15(3k+2m+3)+1 \\\\\\ &=15p+1 \\end{split}$$\n\nfor some integer $p$.  Thus, when $a+b$ is divided by 15, the remainder is 1.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
