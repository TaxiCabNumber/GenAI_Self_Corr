At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each positive integer $n$, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$.  For how many values of $n$ is $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2007$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFor $n=2007$, $S(n)=9$, and $S(S(n))=9$.  Thus, $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2007+9+9=2025\\ne2007$.\n\nFor $n=2006$, $S(n)=8$, and $S(S(n))=8$.  Thus, $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2006+8+8=2022\\ne2007$.\n\nFor $n=2005$, $S(n)=5$, and $S(S(n))=5$.  Thus, $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2005+5+5=2015\\ne2007$.\n\nFor $n=2004$, $S(n)=4$, and $S(S(n))=4$.

Therefore if $n$ satisfies the required condition it must also satisfy \\[\nn\\geq 2007-28-10=1969.\n\\] In addition, $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ all leave the same remainder when divided by 9.

The required condition is satisfied by $\\boxed{4}$ multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007, namely 1977, 1980, 1983, and 2001.\n\nNote: There appear to be many cases to check, that is, all the multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007. However, for $1987\\leq n\\leq 1999$, we have $n+S(n)\\geq 1990+19=2009$, so these numbers are eliminated. Thus we need only check 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2001, and 2004."
