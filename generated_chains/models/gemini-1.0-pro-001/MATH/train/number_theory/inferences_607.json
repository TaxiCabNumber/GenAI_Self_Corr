There are $2^0$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^n$, $2^1 - 2^0 = 2^0$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^{n-1}$ but not by $2^n, \\ldots,$ and $2^{n-1}-2^{n-2} = 2^{n-2}$ elements of $S$ that are divisible by $2^1$ but not by $2^2$.\nThus\\begin{align*} S_n &= 2^0\\cdot2^n + 2^0\\cdot2^{n-1} + 2^1\\cdot2^{n-2} + \\cdots + 2^{n-2}\\cdot2^1\\\\ &= 2^n + (n-1)2^{n-1}\\\\ &= 2^{n-1}(n+1).\\end{align*}Let $2^k$ be the highest power of $2$ that divides $n+1$. Thus by the above formula, the highest power of $2$ that divides $S_n$ is $2^{k+n-1}$. For $S_n$ to be a perfect square, $k+n-1$ must be even. If $k$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, hence $k+n-1$ is odd, and $S_n$ cannot be a perfect square. Hence $k$ must be even. In particular, as $n<1000$, we have five choices for $k$, namely $k=0,2,4,6,8$.\nIf $k=0$, then $n+1$ is odd, so $k+n-1$ is odd, hence the largest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ has an odd exponent, so $S_n$ is not a perfect square.\nIn the other cases, note that $k+n-1$ is even, so the highest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ will be a perfect square. In particular, $S_n$ will be a perfect square if and only if $(n+1)/2^{k}$ is an odd perfect square.\nIf $k=2$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{4} \\le 250$, so we have $n+1 = 4, 4 \\cdot 3^2, \\ldots, 4 \\cdot 13^2, 4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$.\nIf $k=4$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{16} \\le 62$, so $n+1 = 16, 16 \\cdot 3^2, 16 \\cdot 5^2, 16 \\cdot 7^2$.\nIf $k=6$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{64}\\le 15$, so $n+1=64,64\\cdot 3^2$.\nIf $k=8$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{256}\\le 3$, so $n+1=256$.\nComparing the largest term in each case, we find that the maximum possible $n$ such that $S_n$ is a perfect square is $4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 - 1 = \\boxed{899}$."
