At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3?",
        "inference": "1. The multiples of 3 are the numbers that can be written as $3n$, where $n$ is an integer.\n2. To find the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $412+n$ is a multiple of 3.\n3. We can find the remainder when 412 is divided by 3 by using the remainder theorem: $412=3\\cdot137+1$, so the remainder is 1.\n4. Therefore, the smallest positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3 is the number that, when added to 1, gives a multiple of 3. This number is 2, since $1+2=3$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412."
