        "ground_truth": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$."
