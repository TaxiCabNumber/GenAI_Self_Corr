        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the possible digits.\n\nSince the digits' sum is 18 and the number is divisible by 9, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the possible digits are:\n\n* 9, 9, 0\n* 9, 6, 3\n* 9, 3, 6\n\n**Step 2:** Arrange the digits.\n\nTo maximize the number, we need to arrange the digits in descending order. Therefore, the number must be:\n\n* 990\n* 963\n* 936\n\n**Step 3:** Choose the largest multiple of 9.\n\nOf the three possible numbers, 963 is the largest multiple of 9.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{963}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$."
