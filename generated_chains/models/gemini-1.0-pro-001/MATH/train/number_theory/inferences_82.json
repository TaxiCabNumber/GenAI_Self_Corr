At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers 1-9 are divisors of the five-digit number 24,516?",
        "inference": "1 is a divisor of any number.\n2 is a divisor of any even number. 24,516 is even.\n3 is a divisor of any number whose digits add to a multiple of 3. The digits of 24,516 add to 2 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 18, which is a multiple of 3.\n4 is a divisor of any number whose last two digits form a multiple of 4. The last two digits of 24,516 are 16, which is a multiple of 4.\n5 is a divisor of any number whose last digit is 0 or 5. The last digit of 24,516 is 6, so 5 is not a divisor.\n6 is a divisor of any number that is divisible by both 2 and 3. 24,516 is divisible by both 2 and 3, so it is divisible by 6.\n7 is not a divisor of 24,516 because 24,516 is not a multiple of 7.\n8 is not a divisor of 24,516 because 24,516 is not a multiple of 8.\n9 is not a divisor of 24,516 because 24,516 is not a multiple of 9.\n\nTherefore, the divisors of 24,516 from 1-9 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that 24,516 is divisible by 1. Since 24,516 is even, it is also divisible by 2. The sum of the digits of 24,516 is $2+4+5+1+6=18$. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, so 24,516 is divisible by 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. Because 16 is divisible by 4, so is 24,516. 24,516 is not divisible by 5 because it does not end in a 5 or 0. It is divisible by 6 because it was divisible by 2 and 3. In order to see if a number is divisible by 7, it is necessary to double the last digit and subtract that value from the original number without the units digit. (In this case, the original number without the units digit is 2451.) If the resulting number is divisible by 7, then so is the original number. When 12 is subtracted from 2451, we get $2451-12=2439$. Since it is still not clear whether this number is divisible by 7, we repeat the process: $243-18=225$ and $22-10=12$. We can now see that 24,516 is not divisible by 7. In order for a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits must be divisible by 8. Since 516 is not divisible by 8, neither is 24,516. Because the sum of the digits in 24,516 is divisible by 9, 24,516 is divisible by 9. We conclude that 24,516 is divisible by $\\boxed{6}$ of the integers from 1 to 9."
