At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S = \\{5^k | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\le k \\le 2004 \\}$. Given that $5^{2004} = 5443 \\cdots 0625$ has $1401$ digits, how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$?\n",
        "inference": "Every number in the set $S$ is of the form $5^k$, where $k$ is an integer between $0$ and $2004$.\n\nIf $k$ is even, then $5^k$ is even and cannot begin with the digit $1$.\n\nIf $k$ is odd, then $5^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, so $5^k$ ends in the digit $1$.\n\nLet $m$ be the largest integer such that $5^m$ has $1401$ digits. Then $5^{m+1}$ has $1402$ digits, and $5^m$ has $1400$ digits. Therefore, $m = 1400$.\n\nSince $5^k$ has $1401$ digits if and only if $k = 2004$, and all numbers in $S$ with $k < 2004$ have fewer than $1401$ digits, there is only one element of $S$ that begins with the digit $1$, namely $5^{2004}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}.

        "ground_truth": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$."
