At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCall a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
        "inference": "Since we are interested in the greatest 7-10 double, we seek the largest number $N$ for which the digits $d_0, d_1, ..., d_k$ of its base-$7$ representation $N = d_0 + d_1 \\cdot 7 + \\cdots + d_k \\cdot 7^k$ form a base-$10$ number such that $10d_0 + 10d_1 + \\cdots + 10d_k = 2(d_0 + d_1 \\cdot 7 + \\cdots + d_k \\cdot 7^k)$. This last equation is equivalent to $d_0 + d_1 + \\cdots + d_k = 0$. Since $d_0, d_1, ..., d_k$ are the digits of a positive integer, they are all non-negative and their sum cannot be 0 unless they are all 0.

Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double."
