Thus, $d$ divides $(11n+3)-2(6n+1)=n+1$ and $d$ divides $(6n+1)-3(11n+3)=-25n-8$.\n\nSince $d$ divides $n+1$ and $d$ divides $-25n-8$, $d$ divides $1+(-25n-8)=-24n-7$.\n\nSince $d$ divides $n+1$ and $d$ divides $-24n-7$, $d$ divides $(n+1)+(-24n-7)=-23n-6$.\n\nTherefore, $d$ divides $-23n-6$, $-24n-7$, $-25n-8$, and $n+1$. Thus, $d$ divides the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$, $-24n-7$, $-25n-8$, and $n+1$.\n\nWe will find the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$, $-24n-7$, $-25n-8$, and $n+1$.\n\nFirst, we will find the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-24n-7$.\n\nSince $-23n-6=(-24n-7)+n-1$, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-24n-7$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $-24n-7$ and $n-1$.\n\nSince $n-1$ and $-24n-7$ are relatively prime, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-24n-7$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nNext, we will find the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-25n-8$.\n\nSince $-23n-6=(-25n-8)+2n+2$, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-25n-8$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $-25n-8$ and $2n+2$.\n\nSince $2n+2$ and $-25n-8$ are relatively prime, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $-25n-8$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nFinally, we will find the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $n+1$.\n\nSince $-23n-6=(n+1)-24n-7$, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $n+1$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $n+1$ and $-24n-7$.\n\nSince $n+1$ and $-24n-7$ are relatively prime, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$ and $n+1$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $-23n-6$, $-24n-7$, $-25n-8$, and $n+1$ is $\\boxed{1}$.
