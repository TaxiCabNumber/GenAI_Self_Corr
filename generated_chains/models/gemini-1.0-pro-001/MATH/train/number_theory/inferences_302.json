        "inference": "To be divisible by $8$, a four-digit integer must be divisible by $2$ and $4$.\n\nA four-digit integer is divisible by $2$ if its last digit is even. There are $5$ even digits ($2, 4, 6, 8, 0$).\n\nA four-digit integer is divisible by $4$ if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by $4$. There are $5$ such numbers ($00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96$).\n\nTherefore, there are $5 \\times 5 = \\boxed{25}$ positive four-digit integers that are divisible by $8$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.

        "ground_truth": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$."
