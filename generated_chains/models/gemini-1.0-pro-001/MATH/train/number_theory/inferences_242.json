        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x)$ is a function, then we define the function $f^{(n)}(x)$ to be the result of $n$ applications of $f$ to $x$, where $n$ is a positive integer. For example, $f^{(3)}(x)=f(f(f(x)))$.\n\nWe define the $\\textit{order}$ of an input $x$ with respect to $f$ to be the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $f^{(m)}(x)=x$.\n\nNow suppose $f(x)$ is the function defined as the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by $11$. What is the order of $5$ with respect to this function $f$?",
        "inference": "We have $f(x)=x^2\\pmod{11}$. Therefore,\n\n$$f(5)=5^2\\pmod{11}=3$$\n\n$$f(3)=3^2\\pmod{11}=5$$\n\nThus, $f^{(2)}(5)=5$, so the order of $5$ with respect to $f$ is $2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By computing the first few $f^{(n)}(5)$, we get \\begin{align*}\nf^{(1)}(5)=f(5) = 3,\\\\\nf^{(2)}(5)=f(f^{(1)}(5))=f(3)=9,\\\\\nf^{(3)}(5)=f(f^{(2)}(5))=f(9)=4,\\\\\nf^{(4)}(5)=f(f^{(3)}(5))=f(4)=5.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the desired order is $\\boxed{4}$."
