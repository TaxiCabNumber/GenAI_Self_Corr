At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of cookies Eleanor made. \n\nIf she divides the cookies equally among $11$ friends, she has $x = 11y + 4$, where $y$ is the number of cookies each friend gets.\n\nIf she divides the cookies equally among $7$ friends, she has $x = 7z + 1$, where $z$ is the number of cookies each friend gets.\n\nSince $x$ is the same in both equations, we have $11y + 4 = 7z + 1$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{7z - 3}{11}$.\n\nSince $y$ must be an integer, $7z - 3$ must be divisible by $11$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $11$ is $11$, so $7z - 3 = 11k$ for some integer $k$. Solving for $z$, we get $z = \\frac{11k + 3}{7}$.\n\nSince $z$ must be an integer, $11k + 3$ must be divisible by $7$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $7$ is $7$, so $11k + 3 = 7m$ for some integer $m$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{7m - 3}{11}$.\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, $7m - 3$ must be divisible by $11$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $11$ is $11$, so $7m - 3 = 11n$ for some integer $n$. Solving for $m$, we get $m = \\frac{11n + 3}{7}$.\n\nSince $m$ must be an integer, $11n + 3$ must be divisible by $7$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $7$ is $7$, so $11n + 3 = 7p$ for some integer $p$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{7p - 3}{11}$.\n\nSince $n$ must be an integer, $7p - 3$ must be divisible by $11$. The smallest positive integer that is divisible by $11$ is $11$, so $7p - 3 = 11q$ for some integer $q$. Solving for $p$, we get $p = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting $p = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$ into the equation for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{7(\\frac{11q + 3}{7}) - 3}{11} = q$.\n\nSubstituting $n = q$ into the equation for $m$, we get $m = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting $m = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$ into the equation for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{7(\\frac{11q + 3}{7}) - 3}{11} = q$.\n\nSubstituting $k = q$ into the equation for $z$, we get $z = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$.\n\nSubstituting $z = \\frac{11q + 3}{7}$ into the equation for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{7(\\frac{11q + 3}{7}) - 3}{11} = q$.\n\nSubstituting $y = q$ into the equation for $x$, we get $x = 11q + 4$.\n\nSince $x$ is the number of cookies Eleanor made, it must be a positive integer less than $100$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 15$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 26$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 37$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 48$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 59$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 70$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 81$. The next smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is $x = 92$.\n\nThe sum of these possible numbers of cookies is $15 + 26 + 37 + 48 + 59 + 70 + 81 + 92 = 428$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{428}.$ I hope it is correct.",
