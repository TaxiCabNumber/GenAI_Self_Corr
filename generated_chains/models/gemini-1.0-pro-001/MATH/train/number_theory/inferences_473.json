        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many perfect squares less than 1000 have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4?",
        "inference": "There are 9 perfect squares less than 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.\nOf these, 4 have a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4: 4, 9, 36, and 81.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$4$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
