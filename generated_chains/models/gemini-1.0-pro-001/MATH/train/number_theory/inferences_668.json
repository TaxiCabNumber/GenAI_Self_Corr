        "inference": "The perfect square divisors of $\\frac n2$ consist of $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...$\n\nThe perfect cube divisors of $\\frac n3$ consist of $3, 9, 27, 81, ...$\n\nThe perfect fifth divisors of $\\frac n5$ consist of $5, 25, 125, ...$\n\nIt follows that the prime factorization of $n$ consists of the primes $2, 3, 5$ only, and the exponents of these primes are at most $7, 3, 2$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive divisors of $n$ is $(7 + 1)(3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 8 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 96$\n\nOf these divisors, $8$ are multiples of $10$: $10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80$\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of $n$ that are not multiples of $10$ is $96 - 8 = \\boxed{88}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$."
