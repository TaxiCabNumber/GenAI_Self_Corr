I hope it is correct.'\nThe product $N$ of three positive integers is $6$ times their sum, and one of the integers is the sum of the other two. Find the sum of all possible values of $N$.\n",
        "inference": "Let the integers be $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the sum of the other two: $c = a + b$. Then we have $abc = 6(a + b + c) = 6(a + b + a + b) = 6(2a + 2b) = 12(a + b)$. Thus $abc = 12(a + b)$ and $c = a + b$, so $abc = 12(c)$. The only positive integer factors of $12$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $12$. Thus the only possible values of $abc$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, and $12$. The sum of these values is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = \\boxed{28}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.",

Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab = 12$ so $\\{a, b\\}$ is one of $\\{1, 12\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 4\\}$ so $a + b$ is one of $13, 8, 7$ so $N$ is one of $12\\cdot 13 = 156, 12\\cdot 8 = 96, 12\\cdot 7 = 84$ so the answer is $156 + 96 + 84 = \\boxed{336}$."
