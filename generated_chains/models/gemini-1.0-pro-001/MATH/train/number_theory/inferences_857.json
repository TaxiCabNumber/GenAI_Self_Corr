At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Therefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point is the same as the 100th digit of the sequence 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7. The 100th digit of this sequence is 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}.
