At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Therefore, in order for $n$ to be superdeficient, $f(n) = n+1$ and $f(n+1) = n+2$. However, if $f(k) = k+1$, then $k$ must be prime. Therefore, we are searching for consecutive prime integers. However, one of those primes must necessarily be even, and the only even prime is $2$. Note that $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$, so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ superdeficient number: $2$."
