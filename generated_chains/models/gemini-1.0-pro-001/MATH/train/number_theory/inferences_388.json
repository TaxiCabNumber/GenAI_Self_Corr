At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Joyce counts the pennies in her bank by fives, she has one left over. When she counts them by threes, there are two left over. What is the least possible number of pennies in the bank?",
        "inference": "Let \\( x\\) be the number of pennies in the bank. Then \\( x - 1\\) is divisible by 5 and \\( x - 2\\) is divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( x\\) is one more than a multiple of 5 and two more than a multiple of 3. The least positive integer of the form \\( 5k + 1\\) that is also of the form \\( 3m + 2\\) is \\( 29 = 5 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 3 \\cdot 9 + 2\\). Therefore, the least possible number of pennies is \\( 29\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$29$}. I hope it is correct.",
