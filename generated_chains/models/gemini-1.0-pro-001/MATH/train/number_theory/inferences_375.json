        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the total number of books in the warehouse.**\n\nTotal books = Number of boxes * Number of books per box\nTotal books = 1335 * 39\nTotal books = 52065\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many boxes can be packed with 40 books each.**\n\nNumber of boxes = Total books / Number of books per box\nNumber of boxes = 52065 / 40\nNumber of boxes = 1301.625 (rounded down to 1301)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of books left over.**\n\nBooks left over = Total books - (Number of boxes * Number of books per box)\nBooks left over = 52065 - (1301 * 40)\nBooks left over = 52065 - 52040\nBooks left over = 25\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{25}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books."
