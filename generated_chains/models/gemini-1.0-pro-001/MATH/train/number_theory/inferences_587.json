If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$.
