At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
        "inference": "Let the four-digit integer be \\(n\\). Then, the eight-digit integer is \\(10000000n+n=10001000n\\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form is the greatest common divisor of all numbers of the form \\(10001000n\\). Now, \\(10001000=2^6\\cdot5^6\\), and \\(n\\) is a positive four-digit integer, so \\(n\\) is divisible by \\(2^2=4\\) and \\(n\\) is not divisible by \\(2^3=8\\). Similarly, \\(n\\) is divisible by \\(5^2=25\\) and \\(n\\) is not divisible by \\(5^3=125\\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form is \\(2^2\\cdot5^2=100\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$100$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$."
