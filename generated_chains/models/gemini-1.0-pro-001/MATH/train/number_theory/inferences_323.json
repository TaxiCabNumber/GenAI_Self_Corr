At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGeorge is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the amount of change, in cents.\n\nGetting the most quarters possible means there are no dimes and therefore no pennies. So, the amount of change in cents must be a multiple of 25.\n\nGetting the most dimes possible means there are no quarters and therefore no pennies. So, the amount of change in cents must be a multiple of 10.\n\nSince the amount of change is less than one dollar, it must be less than 100 cents.\n\nThe only possible amounts of change that satisfy all of these conditions are multiples of 5, since they are multiples of both 25 and 10.\n\nThe possible amounts of change that he is trying to get are \\(5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95\\).\n\nThe sum of these possible amounts of change is \n\n$$5+10+15+20+25+30+35+40+45+50+55+60+65+70+75+80+85+90+95=945$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$945$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents."
