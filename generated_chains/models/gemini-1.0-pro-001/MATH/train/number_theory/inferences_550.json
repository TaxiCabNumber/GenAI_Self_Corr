        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. (Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\n",
        "inference": "Solution:\nMary's score is $s = 30+4c-w$. We know that $s>80$, so $30+4c-w>80$. Simplifying, we get $4c-w>50$.\n\nIf Mary's score were any lower but still over $80$, then $s \\leq 80$, so $30+4c-w \\leq 80$. Simplifying, we get $4c-w \\leq 50$.\n\nTherefore, the only way that John could have determined the number of problems Mary solved correctly is if $4c-w=50$.\n\nTo find the number of correct answers, we need to solve $4c-w=50$. We can do this by trial and error. We can start by trying $c=10$ and $w=0$, which gives us $4c-w=40$. This is too small, so we need to try a larger value for $c$. We can try $c=11$ and $w=0$, which gives us $4c-w=44$. This is still too small, so we need to try a larger value for $c$. We can keep trying larger values for $c$ until we find a value that gives us $4c-w=50$.\n\nWe find that $c=13$ and $w=2$ gives us $4c-w=50$. Therefore, Mary solved $13$ problems correctly.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$."
