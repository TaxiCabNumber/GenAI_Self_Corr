At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA box contains gold coins. If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over. If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over. If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of coins. Then, x divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4. That is, x = 6k + 4 for some integer k, where k is the number of sets of six coins. Similarly, x = 5m + 3 for some integer m, where m is the number of sets of five coins. We want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies both of these equations.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 6k + 4 &= 5m + 3 \\\\ 6k - 5m &= 1 \\end{aligned}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get\n\n$$30k - 25m = 5$$\n\nTherefore, 30k - 25m is a multiple of 5. Since k and m are integers, 30k and 25m are also integers. So, 30k - 25m must be a multiple of 5 greater than or equal to 5. The only multiple of 5 greater than or equal to 5 and less than 30 is 10. So, \n\n$$30k - 25m = 10$$\n\nSolving for k, we get\n\n$$k = \\frac{10 + 25m}{30} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{6}m$$\n\nSince k is an integer, m must be a multiple of 3. The smallest multiple of 3 greater than or equal to 0 is 3. So, m = 3, and k = 2. Therefore,\n\n$$x = 6k + 4 = 6(2) + 4 = 16$$\n\nIf the coins are equally divided among seven people, there will be 16 divided by 7, or 2 coins left over.\n\n\\(\\text{Final Answer: }\\boxed{2}. \\text{ I hope it is correct.}\\)",
        "ground_truth": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions.
