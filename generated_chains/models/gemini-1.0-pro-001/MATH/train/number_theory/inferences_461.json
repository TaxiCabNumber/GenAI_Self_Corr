At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.  How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?",
        "inference": "The difference between two consecutive squares is an odd number, because even numbers squared are even and odd numbers squared are odd.  For the difference to be less than 10,000, the larger odd number cannot exceed 10,000.  Hence the largest perfect square to consider is 9985, whose square root is 99.  Since consecutive perfect squares differ by consecutive odd integers, the possible odd differences for which the larger perfect square does not exceed 9985 are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15.  There are seven such odd differences.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares."
