I hope it is correct.'\nEach pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nLet's assume that Phil bought x packs of hot dogs and y packs of hot dog buns. Since each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs is 10x. Similarly, the total number of hot dog buns is 8y.  We know that there are 4 hot dogs left over, so the total number of hot dogs is 10x - 4.  We also know that Phil bought a whole number of packs of hot dogs and hot dog buns, so x and y must be whole numbers.  The question asks for the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought, so we need to find the second smallest value of x that satisfies these conditions.  To find the second smallest value of x, we can start by finding the smallest value of x. The smallest value of x is when there are no hot dogs left over, so 10x - 4 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 4 / 10 = 0.4.  Since x must be a whole number, the smallest value of x is 1.  The second smallest value of x is the next smallest whole number that satisfies the conditions. To find the second smallest value of x, we can try x = 2. Substituting x = 2 into the equation 10x - 4, we get 10(2) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16.  Since there are 16 hot dogs and each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs, Phil must have bought 16 / 10 = 1.6 packs of hot dogs.  Since x must be a whole number, the second smallest value of x is 2.  Therefore, the second smallest number of packs of hot dogs Phil could have bought is 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$."
