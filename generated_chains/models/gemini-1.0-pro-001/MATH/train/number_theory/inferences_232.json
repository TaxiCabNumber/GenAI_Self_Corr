        "inference": "**Step 1** \nWe can first simplify $5^{137}$ as follows: \n\n$$5^{137} = 5^{136} \\cdot  5= (5^4)^{34} \\cdot  5=625^{34} \\cdot  5$$ \n\n**Step 2** \nNow, we can find the remainder when $625^{34}$ is divided by 8: \n\n$$625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$$\n\nTherefore, \n\n$$625^{34} \\equiv 1^{34} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$$ \n\n**Step 3** \nFinally, we can find the remainder when $625^{34} \\cdot 5$ is divided by 8: \n\n$$625^{34} \\cdot 5 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$$ \n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$5$}.

        "ground_truth": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8."
