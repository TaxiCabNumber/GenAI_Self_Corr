        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNatasha has more than $\\$1$ but less than $\\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
        "inference": "Let's say Natasha has $x$ dimes.\nThen, $x$ is greater than 1 and less than 10.\nWhen she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over.\nSo, $x = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nWhen she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over.\nSo, $x = 4l + 1$ for some integer $l$.\nWhen she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over.\nSo, $x = 5m + 1$ for some integer $m$.\nNow, we can solve for $x$.\nFirst, we can find a common multiple of 3, 4, and 5.\nThe least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is 60.\nSo, $x = 60n + 1$ for some integer $n$.\nBut $x$ is greater than 1 and less than 10.\nSo, $1<60n+1<10$.\nSolving for $n$, we get $0<60n<9$.\nSo, $n=0$ or $n=1$.\nIf $n=0$, then $x=1$.\nBut $x$ is greater than 1.\nSo, $n=1$.\nTherefore, $x=60(1)+1=\\boxed{61}$.\nFinal Answer: $61$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system."
