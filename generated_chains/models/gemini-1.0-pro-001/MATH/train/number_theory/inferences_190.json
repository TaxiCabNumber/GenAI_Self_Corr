        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of students in this class. \n\nSince $x$ is fewer than $40$, we have $x < 40$. \n\nWhen they try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. This means that $x$ is 3 more than a multiple of $7$. Thus, $x = 7a + 3$ for some integer $a$. \n\nWhen they try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. This means that $x$ is 1 more than a multiple of $5$. Thus, $x = 5b + 1$ for some integer $b$. \n\nSince $x$ is both $7a + 3$ and $5b + 1$, we have $7a + 3 = 5b + 1$. Solving this equation for $a$, we get $a = \\frac{5b - 2}{7}$. \n\nSince $a$ is an integer, $5b - 2$ must be divisible by $7$. The only multiple of $5$ between $1$ and $40$ that is $2$ more than a multiple of $7$ is $32$. Thus, $5b - 2 = 32$, and $b = 7$. \n\nTherefore, $x = 5b + 1 = 5(7) + 1 = \\boxed{36}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class."
