        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer.",
        "inference": "Since $\\frac{n+6}{n} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $n+6$ is a multiple of $n$. Thus $n+6 = kn$ for some integer $k$. Solving this for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{6}{k-1}$. Since $n$ is an integer, $k-1$ must be a divisor of $6$. Thus $k-1 \\in \\{1,2,3,6\\}$, and $k \\in \\{2,3,4,7\\}$. Therefore, $n = \\frac{6}{k-1} \\in \\{6,3,2,1\\}$. The sum of these values is $6+3+2+1 = 12$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$."
