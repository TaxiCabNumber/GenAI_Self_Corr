At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible, how many people will end up with fewer than 7 cards?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince 52 is not divisible by 8, it is not possible to divide the cards evenly among the 8 people.\nThus, all 8 people will end up with fewer than 7 cards.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4.  Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards."
