At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome?",
        "inference": "We can start by subtracting $5678$ from the palindrome. The resulting number must be divisible by $11$ to be a palindrome. So we find the smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $5678$: $11 * 517 = 5687$. Subtracting $5678$ from $5687$ gives $9$. So the smallest positive value of $x$ is $9$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$."
