At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA magic square is an array of numbers in which the sum of the numbers in each row, in each column, and along the two main diagonals are equal. The numbers in the magic square shown are not written in base 10. For what base will this be a magic square?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.75cm);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((0,i)--(3,i),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((i,0)--(i,3),linewidth(0.7));\n}\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(2.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(0.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"4\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(1.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"11\",(2.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"12\",(2.5,1),N);\nlabel(\"13\",(0.5,2),N);\nlabel(\"14\",(1.5,0),N);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The sum of each row, column and diagonal is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 50. Since each number in the square must be unique, the base must be greater than or equal to 50. The only base greater than or equal to 50 that gives a sum of 50 for each row, column and diagonal is base 15.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$."
