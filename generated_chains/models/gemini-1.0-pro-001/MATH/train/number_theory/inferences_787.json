        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x=0.\\overline{ab}\\). Then\n$$100x = 10.\\overline{ab}$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, \n$$100x-x = 10.\\overline{ab}-0.\\overline{ab}$$\n\nIt implies that \n$$99x=10(\\overline{ab}-\\overline{0})=10[(a\\times 10)+b-(0\\times 10)]=10(10a+b)$$\n\n$$x=\\frac{10(10a+b)}{99}=\\frac{100a + 10b}{99}=\\frac{10(10a+b)}{9\\times 11}$$\n\n$$=\\frac{10a+b}{9\\times 11}$$\n\nHence, there are 9 different denominators possible.\n**Final Answer:$\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
