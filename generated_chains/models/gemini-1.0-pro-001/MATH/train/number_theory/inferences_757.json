At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
