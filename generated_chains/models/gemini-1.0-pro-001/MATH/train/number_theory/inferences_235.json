At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $120$, and the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, then what is their greatest common divisor?",
        "inference": "Let $A=3x$ and $B=4x$, where $x$ is their greatest common divisor. \n\nThen the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $120$, so $3x\\times4x=120\\Rightarrow x=5$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$ is $5$.\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:4$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=4k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $120k=(3k)(4k),$ which implies $k=120/12=\\boxed{10}$."
