At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor all composite integers $n$, what is the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$?",
        "inference": "The difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ can be factored as $n - n^3 = n(1 - n^2) = n(1 - n)(1 + n) = n(1 - n)(n + 1)$.\n\nThe largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$ is the greatest common divisor of $n$, $1 - n$, and $n + 1$.\n\nThe greatest common divisor of $n$, $1 - n$, and $n + 1$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$."
