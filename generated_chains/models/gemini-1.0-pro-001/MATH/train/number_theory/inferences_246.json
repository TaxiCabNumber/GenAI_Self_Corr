        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $n$ is divided by 6, a remainder of 1 is given. What is the remainder when $n+2010$ is divided by 6?",
        "inference": "When n is divided by 6, the remainder is 1. This means that $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe want to find the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6. This is the same as finding the remainder when $6k + 1 + 2010$ is divided by 6.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get $6k + 2011$.\n\nNow, we can see that $6k + 2011 = 6(335k) + 1$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6 is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6."
