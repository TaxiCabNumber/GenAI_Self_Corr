At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 54 chips in a box. Each chip is either small or large. If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of large chips.\n\nThen, the number of small chips is x + (prime number).\n\nSince x + (prime number) > x, the prime number must be 1.\n\nSo, the number of small chips is x + 1.\n\nSince the total number of chips is 54, we have:\n\nx + (x + 1) = 54\n\n2x + 1 = 54\n\n2x = 53\n\nx = 26.5\n\nSince x must be a whole number, the greatest possible number of large chips is:\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{26}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$."
