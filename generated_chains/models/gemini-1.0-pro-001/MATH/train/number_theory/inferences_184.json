At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $A$ be the set of all numbers which can be represented as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$?",

Their sum is $3n+3=3(n+1)$.\n\n**Step 2:** Therefore, every number in $A$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\n**Step 3:** The greatest common divisor of all numbers in $A$ is the greatest common divisor of $3$ and $3(n+1)$, which is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $3$.
