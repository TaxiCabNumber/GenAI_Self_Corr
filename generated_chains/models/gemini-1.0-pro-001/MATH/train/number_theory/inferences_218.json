I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
        "inference": "Since the greatest common divisor is $(x+5)$, both integers must be multiples of $(x+5)$. Let the integers be $50$ and $k(x+5)$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, so we have\n\n$$50k(x+5) = x(x+5).$$\n\nDividing both sides by $(x+5)$, we get\n\n$$50k = x.$$\n\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be a divisor of $50$. The smallest positive divisor of $50$ is $1$, so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $1$.

The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.

The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$."
