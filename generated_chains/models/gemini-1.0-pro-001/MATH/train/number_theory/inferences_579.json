        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $6^{20}$?\n",
        "inference": "Let $H$ be the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$. Then we have\n\n$$\\frac{2}{H}=\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}.$$Substituting $H=6^{20}$, we get $$\\frac{1}{36^{20}}=\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}.$$Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we must have $x\\geq 2$ and $y\\geq 3$. We can list all possible pairs $(x,y)$ and check if they satisfy the equation. For example, when $x=2$, we have $y=37$. When $x=3$, we have $y=19$. When $x=4$, we have $y=13$. When $x=5$, we have $y=11$. When $x=6$, we have $y=9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ for which the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $6^{20}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}2} = \\frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\\frac{1599-1}{2}= \\boxed{799}$."
