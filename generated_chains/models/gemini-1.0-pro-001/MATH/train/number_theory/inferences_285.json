At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47?",
        "inference": "We can start by finding the remainder when 1000 is divided by 47.\n\n1000 / 47 = 21.2766...\n\nThe remainder is approximately 21.\n\nSo, we need to add 26 to 1000 to get the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47.\n\n1000 + 26 = 1026\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1026}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$."
