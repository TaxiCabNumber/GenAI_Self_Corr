        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
        "inference": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=4896$. Since this product is odd, the only other four-letter list with a product equal to this product must also be odd. Thus, it must contain one of the numbers 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, or 25. Since there are only two natural numbers less than 26 which have an odd number of factors, those two are the only possibilities.\n\n**Case 1:** The only odd natural numbers less than 26 with an even number of factors are $9=3\\cdot 3$ and $15=3\\cdot 5$. We can combine $9$ with three other factors in $(12)(3!)=108$ ways. \n\n**Case 2:** The only odd natural numbers less than 26 with an odd number of factors are $7=1\\cdot 7$ and $21=3\\cdot 7$. We can combine $7$ with three other factors in $(8)(3!)=168$ ways, or we can combine $21$ with three other factors in $(4)(3!)=36$ ways. \n\nThus, there are $108+168+36=312$ other four-letter lists with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$. The only one that is in alphabetical order is $AXUZ$.\n**Final Answer:  $\\boxed{AXUZ}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$."
