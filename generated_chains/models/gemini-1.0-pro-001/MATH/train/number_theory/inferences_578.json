A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit. The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97. Their sum is $\\boxed{418}$."
