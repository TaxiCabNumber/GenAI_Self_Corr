At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let the integer be $10x+y$. Then, the resulting integer after deleting the leftmost digit is $y$. Therefore, we have the following equation:\n\n$$10x+y=\\frac{1}{29}y$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 29, we get:\n\n$$290x+29y=y$$\n\nSubtracting 29y from both sides, we get:\n\n$$290x=-28y$$\n\nDividing both sides by -28, we get:\n\n$$x=\\frac{y}{10}$$\n\nSince x is an integer, y must be a multiple of 10. The smallest positive multiple of 10 is 10. Therefore, y=10 and x=1. The least positive integer satisfying the given condition is therefore $10x+y=10(1)+10=\\boxed{20}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The desired integer has at least two digits.  Let $d$ be its leftmost digit, and let $n$ be the integer that results when $d$ is deleted.  Then for some positive integer $p$, $10^p\\cdot\nd+n=29n$, and so $10^p\\cdot d=28n$. Therefore 7 is a divisor of $d$, and because $1\\le d\\le9$, it follows that $d=7$. Hence $10^p=4n$, so $\\displaystyle n={{10^p}\\over4}=\n{{100\\cdot10^{p-2}}\\over4}=25\\cdot10^{p-2}$.  Thus every positive integer with the desired property must be of the form $7\\cdot10^p+25\\cdot10^{p-2}=10^{p-2}(7\\cdot10^2+25)=725\\cdot10^{p-2}$ for some $p\\ge2$. The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{725}$."
