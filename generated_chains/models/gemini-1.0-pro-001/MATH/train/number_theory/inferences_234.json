At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJo is thinking of a positive integer less than 100. It is one less than a multiple of 8, and it is three less than a multiple of 7. What is the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let \\(x\\) be the number Jo is thinking of.\n**Step 2:** Since \\(x\\) is one less than a multiple of 8, \\(x = 8k - 1\\) for some integer \\(k\\).\n**Step 3:** Since \\(x\\) is three less than a multiple of 7, \\(x = 7l - 3\\) for some integer \\(l\\).\n**Step 4:** Set the two expressions for \\(x\\) equal to each other: \\(8k - 1 = 7l - 3\\).\n**Step 5:** Solve for \\(k\\): \\(8k = 7l + 2\\).\n**Step 6:** Since \\(l\\) is an integer, \\(7l\\) is even. Thus, \\(7l + 2\\) is also even. However, \\(8k\\) is not necessarily even. This means there is no solution that satisfies both conditions, so there is no integer Jo could be thinking of.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{There is no solution}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of. We know $n<100$ and $n=8k-1=7l-3$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$. From this we see that $7l=8k+2=2(4k+1)$, so $7l$ is a multiple of 14. List some multiples of 14, in decreasing order: 112, 98, 84, 70, .... Since $n<100$, 112 is too large, but 98 works: $7k=98\\Rightarrow n=98-3=95=8(12)-1$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{95}$."
