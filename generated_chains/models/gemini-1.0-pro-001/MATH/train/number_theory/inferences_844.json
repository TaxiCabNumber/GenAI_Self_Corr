At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
        "inference": "37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59 and 61 have prime remainders when divided by 10. Hence the number of such prime numbers is 7.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers."
