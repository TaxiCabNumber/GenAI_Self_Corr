At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen four positive integers are divided by $11$, the remainders are $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $8,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the four integers is divided by $11$, what is the remainder?",
        "inference": "Since $ 11 $ is a prime number, when a sum of integers is divided by $11$, the remainder is the sum of the remainders when each integer is divided by $11$.\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the four integers is divided by $11$, the remainder is $2+4+6+8=\\boxed{20}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$.
