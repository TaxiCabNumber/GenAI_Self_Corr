At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors?",
        "inference": "1. The smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors is a number that can be expressed as the product of 4 distinct primes.\n2. The smallest 4 distinct primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n3. The product of these primes is 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 210.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$210$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that the number of whole number divisors of a positive integer can be determined by prime factorizing the integer, adding 1 to each of the exponents, and multiplying the results.  If a positive integer has 10 factors, then the set of exponents in the prime factorization is $\\{1,4\\}$ or $\\{9\\}$.  For each set of exponents, the smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has the given set of exponents is achieved by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes 2, 3, 5, etc.  The smallest positive integer with an exponent of 9 in the prime factorization is $2^9=512$.  The smallest positive integer whose prime factorization has exponents 1 and 4 is $2^4\\cdot 3^1=48$.  Since $48<512$, $\\boxed{48}$ is the smallest positive integer with 10 positive integer divisors."
