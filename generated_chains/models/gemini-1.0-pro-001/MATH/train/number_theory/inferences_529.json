At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Find the three-digit number ${ABC}$. (Interpret $AB_6$ as a base-6 number with digits $A$ and $B$, not as $A$ times $B$. The other expressions should be interpreted in this way as well).",
