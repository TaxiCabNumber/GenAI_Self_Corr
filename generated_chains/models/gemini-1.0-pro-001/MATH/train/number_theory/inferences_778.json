I hope it is correct.'\nA day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of periods of length $m$. The total number of seconds in a day is $86400$, so $xm = 86400$. Dividing both sides by $m$, we get $x = \\frac{86400}{m}$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, $m$ must be a divisor of $86400$. The divisors of $86400$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 28, 32, 35, 42, 48, 60, 63, 70, 84, 96, 105, 112, 120, 126, 140, 168, 210, 240, 252, 280, 315, 336, 420, 504, 560, 630, 720, 840, 1008, 1120, 1260, 1440, 1680, 2016, 2240, 2520, 2880, 3150, 3600, 4032, 4480, 5040, 5600, 6300, 7200, 8064, 8960, 10080, 11200, 12600, 14400, 16800, 20160, 22400, 25200, 28800, 31500, 36000, 40320, 44800, 50400, 56000, 63000, 72000, 80640, 89600$.\nThe number of ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds is equal to the number of divisors of $86400$, which is $\\boxed{48}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A day has $86,\\!400$ seconds. $86,\\!400=2^7\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors. Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\\boxed{96}$ ways."
