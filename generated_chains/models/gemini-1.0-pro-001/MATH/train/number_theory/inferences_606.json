        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of rows and $y$ be the number of columns in the formation.\n\n**Step 1: Translate the given information into equations.**\n\n* When arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over: $x = y \\Rightarrow x^2 - 5 = 0$.\n* When arranged in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over: $x = y + 7 \\Rightarrow x - y = 7$.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the system of equations.**\n\nSolve the first equation for $x$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n\n$$x^2 - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{5}$$\n\n$$(\\sqrt{5}) - y = 7 \\Rightarrow y = \\sqrt{5} - 7$$\n\n**Step 3: Find the maximum number of members by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ back into one of the original equations.**\n\n$$x^2 - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow (\\sqrt{5})^2 - 5 = 0 \\Rightarrow 5 - 5 = 0$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5$}.

        "ground_truth": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$."
