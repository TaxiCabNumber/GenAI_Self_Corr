At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right. What is the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the greatest digit of the four. Then the number is \n\n$$1000x+100(x-1)+10(x-2)+(x-3)$$ which simplifies to $$1111x-317=1111(x-3)+854.$$ Thus the number is congruent to $317$ modulo $37$. Since $317=37\\cdot8+13$, the possible remainders are $13$ and $30$. The sum of these two remainders is $13+30=\\boxed{43}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{43}$. I hope it is correct.",

So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$."
