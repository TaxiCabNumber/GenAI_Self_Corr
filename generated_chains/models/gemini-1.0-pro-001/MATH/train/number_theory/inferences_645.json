        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many two-digit numbers can be written in the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an integer?",
        "inference": "Since $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$, $2^3 = 8$ and $2^4 = 16$ all have only one digit we can eliminate all the numbers less than $2^4$. On the other hand, $2^{10} = 1024$ has more than two digits so we can eliminate all the numbers greater than $2^9$. Hence, the only integers $n$ for which $2^n$ is a two-digit number is $5 \\le n \\le 9$. Thus, there are $9 - 5 + 1 = 5$ two-digit integers that can be written in the form $2^n$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers."
