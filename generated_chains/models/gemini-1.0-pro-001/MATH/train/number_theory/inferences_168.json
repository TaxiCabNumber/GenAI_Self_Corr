At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest positive integer that must divide the sum of the first ten terms of any arithmetic sequence whose terms are positive integers?",
        "inference": "Let \\(s_n\\) be the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with positive integer terms. Then \\(s_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\\), where \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_n\\) are the first and nth terms, respectively.\n\nFor \\(n = 10\\), we have \\(s_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} (a_1 + a_{10})\\). Since \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_{10}\\) are positive integers, their sum is also a positive integer. Therefore, the greatest positive integer that divides \\(s_{10}\\) is \\(\\frac{10}{2} = \\boxed{5}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first 10 terms of any arithmetic sequence can be represented as $x$, $x+c$, $x+2c$, $\\ldots x+9c$, where $x$ is the first term and $c$ is the constant difference between each consecutive term. So, the sum of all of these terms will include $10x$ and $(1+2+\\ldots+9)c$, which equals $45c$. As a result, the sum of all the terms is $10x+45c$ and the greatest number we can factor out is $\\boxed{5}$, where we end up with $5(2x+9c)$."
