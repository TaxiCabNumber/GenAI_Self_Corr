At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$."
