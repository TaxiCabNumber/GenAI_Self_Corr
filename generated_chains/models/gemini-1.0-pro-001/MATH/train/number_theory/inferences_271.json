        "ground_truth": "Converting from a decimal to a fraction, we obtain $0.abc = \\frac{abc}{1000} = \\frac{abc}{2^3\\cdot5^3} = \\frac{1}{y}$. Since $0<y\\le9$ and $y$ divides into $1000$, $y$ must equal one of $1,2,4,5$ or $8$. Notice that $y\\neq1$ because then $abc = 1000$, which is impossible as $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits.
