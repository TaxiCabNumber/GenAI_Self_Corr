At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen we say that Ray is climbing up the stairs $m$ at a time, we mean that he starts on the floor (step $0$) then jumps to step $m$ and then to $2m$ and so on until the number of steps to the top is less than $m$. Ray climbs up a flight of stairs of $n$ steps in two ways. When he does it $4$ steps at a time, there are $3$ steps left at the top. When he does it $5$ steps at a time, there are $2$ steps left at the top. What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that is greater than $10$?",
        "inference": "Let us assume that Ray climbed up the stairs $m$ steps at a time. \nThen the total height of the stairs is $n=qm+r$, where $q$ is the number of jumps and $r$ is the number of steps left at the top. \nHence we have the two equations \n$$n=4q+3,\\quad n=5p+2.$$This gives $4q+3=5p+2,$ or $4q-5p=-1.$Since $4$ and $5$ are relatively prime, this implies that $q-p$ is divisible by $5$. The smallest value of $n$ greater than $10$ is $n=11$, which is obtained when $q=3$ and $p=2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The given information translates to the congruences \\begin{align*}\nn\\equiv 3 & \\pmod 4,\\\\\nn\\equiv 2 & \\pmod 5.\\\\\n\\end{align*}From the first congruence we obtain that $n = 3+4k$ for some integer $k.$ Combining this result with the second congruence, we have $3+4k=n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5.$ Therefore, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5.$ So, $k = 1+5t$ for some integer $t.$ Substituting $1+5t$ for $k$, we have  \\begin{align*}\nn &=3+4k\\\\\n&=3+4(1+5t)\\\\\n&=7+20t \\equiv 7 \\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}The smallest such $n$ greater than $10$ is $\\boxed{27}$."
