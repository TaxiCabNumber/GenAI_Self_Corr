At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "First, we can write $x$ in expanded form:\n$$x = 2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9 = 2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdot4^4\\cdot5^5\\cdot6^6\\cdot7^7\\cdot8^8\\cdot9^9$$\n\nNext, we can factor out the squares from each of the factors:\n$$x = (2^2)(3^2)(4^2)(5^2)(6^2)(7^2)(8^2)(9^2)$$\n\nFinally, we can multiply the factors together to get the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a perfect square:\n$$y = (2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9)^2 = 8!\\cdot9^2 = 40320^2 = 1.627656\\times10^9$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1.627656\\times10^9$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
