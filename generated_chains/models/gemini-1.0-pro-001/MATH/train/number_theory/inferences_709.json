        "inference": "**Problem:** What is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 30 and 40:\n\n```\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n40 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 5\nLCM(30, 40) = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 60\n```\n\n2. Find the LCM of 60 and 16:\n\n```\n60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\n16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2\nLCM(60, 16) = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 120\n```\n\n3. The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16 is the LCM of 30 and 40 divided by the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 60 and 16:\n\n```\nSmallest positive integer = LCM(30, 40) / GCD(60, 16)\n= 60 / 20\n= 3\n```\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not."
