        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?",
        "inference": "There are 5 positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100, and they are 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45. All of these numbers have a units digit of 5. Therefore, there are 5 positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 and have a units digit of 5.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5."
