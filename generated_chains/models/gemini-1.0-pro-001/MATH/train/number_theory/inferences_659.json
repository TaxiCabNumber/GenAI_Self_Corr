Then the sum of any two of these elements is congruent to $4\\text{ (mod }7)$, and hence cannot be in $S$. Therefore, $S$ does not contain more than two elements congruent to $2\\text{ (mod }7)$.

These pairs are $(0,0)$, $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, and $(3,4)$. Because $(0,0)$ is a pair, there can always be $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, and no more.\nTo maximize the amount of numbers in S, we will use $1$ number equivalent to $0 \\mod 7$, $8$ numbers equivalent to $1$, and $14$ numbers equivalent to $2$-$5$. This is obvious if you think for a moment. Therefore the answer is $1+8+14=\\boxed{23}$ numbers."
