Integers divisible by 5 are those ending in 0 or 5, and there are $\\lfloor\\frac{995}{5}\\rfloor + 1 = 199$ such integers.\n3. Integers divisible by 11 have alternating digits sum to a multiple of 11.  For three-digit integers, the first digit added to the last digit must be a multiple of 11, and the remaining middle digit must be 0.  There are $\\lfloor\\frac{9}{2}\\rfloor + 1 = 5$ such integers.\n4. Integers divisible by both 11 and 5 are those ending in 0 and with the first digit added to the last digit being a multiple of 11.

        "ground_truth": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$."
