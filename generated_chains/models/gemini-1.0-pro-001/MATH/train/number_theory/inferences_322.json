At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes. How many other positive integers are the products of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a+b+c$?",
        "inference": "If we decompose both $2005$ and $5002$ into primes, we have:\n$$2005 = 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 31,$$\n\n$$5002 = 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 359.$$\n\nSo we have $a = 5$, $b = 13$ and $c = 31$.\n\nNow, we have to find all the positive integers that are the product of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 49$.\n\nSince $49 = 7 + 11 + 31$, the only positive integer that is the product of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 49$ is $2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 31 = 5002$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "5002 factors to $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, which sums to 104.  Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102.  We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime.  We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already.  In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\\boxed{7 \\text{ distinct integers}}$."
