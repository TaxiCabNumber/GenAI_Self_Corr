At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince 1200/2=600 and 600/2=300, we have\n\n$$1200=2^9\\cdot 3$$\n\nSince 200/2=100 and 100/2=50, we have\n\n$$200=2^7\\cdot 5^2$$\n\nThus, 1200 has 9-7=2 more digits than 200 when expressed in base 2.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations."
