        "ground_truth": "Note that $x \\equiv y \\pmod{1000} \\Leftrightarrow x \\equiv y \\pmod{125}$ and $x \\equiv y \\pmod{8}$. So we must find the first two integers $i$ and $j$ such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{125}$ and $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{8}$ and $i \\neq j$. Note that $i$ and $j$ will be greater than 2 since remainders of $1, 2, 4$ will not be possible after 2 (the numbers following will always be congruent to 0 modulo 8). Note that $2^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ (see Euler's theorem) and $2^0,2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{99}$ are all distinct modulo 125 (proof below). Thus, $i = 103$ and $j =3$ are the first two integers such that $2^i \\equiv 2^j \\pmod{1000}$. All that is left is to find $S$ in mod $1000$. After some computation:\\[S = 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+...+2^{101}+ 2^{102} = 2^{103}-1 \\equiv 8 - 1 \\mod 1000 = \\boxed{7}.\\]To show that $2^0, 2^1,\\ldots, 2^{99}$ are distinct modulo 125, suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not. Then, we must have at least one of $2^{20}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$ or $2^{50}\\equiv 1\\pmod{125}$. However, writing $2^{10}\\equiv 25 - 1\\pmod{125}$, we can easily verify that $2^{20}\\equiv -49\\pmod{125}$ and $2^{50}\\equiv -1\\pmod{125}$, giving us the needed contradiction."
