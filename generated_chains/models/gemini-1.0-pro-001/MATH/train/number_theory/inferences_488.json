At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?",
        "inference": "First, we find the multiples of 3, 4, and 5 that are closest to 100:\n* Multiples of 3: 93, 96, 99\n* Multiples of 4: 92, 96, 100\n* Multiples of 5: 90, 95, 100\n\nSince the number of students is 1 less than a multiple of 3, we eliminate 93 and 99.\n\nSince the number of students is 2 less than a multiple of 4, we eliminate 92.\n\nSince the number of students is 3 less than a multiple of 5, we eliminate 90 and 100.\n\nTherefore, the number of students must be 96.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{96}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$."
