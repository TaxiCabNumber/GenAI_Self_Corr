        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
        "inference": "In 122 hours, it will be 5 days and 2 hours later.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, 122 hours is equal to 5 days and 2 hours.  In 39 minutes, it will be 39/60 hours later.  In 44 seconds, it will be 44/3600 hours later.  Therefore, the total amount of time that will have passed is 5 days + 2 hours + 39/60 hours + 44/3600 hours, which is equal to 5.08333333333 days.  To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24, which gives us 122 hours.  Therefore, the time will be 122:39:44.  Adding the digits together, we get $1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 4 = \\boxed{25}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$."
