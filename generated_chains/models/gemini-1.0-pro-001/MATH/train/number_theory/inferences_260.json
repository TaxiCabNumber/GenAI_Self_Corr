At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$. To find the smallest 3-digit palindrome in a different base, we can try base 3, 4, and 5.\n\nIn base 3, the smallest 3-digit palindrome is $101_3$.\n\nIn base 4, the smallest 3-digit palindrome is $111_4$.\n\nIn base 5, the smallest 3-digit palindrome is $121_5$.\n\nSince $10001_2 = 121_5$, the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base is $10001_2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10001_2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works."
