At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminate?",
        "inference": "We know that the decimal representation of a rational number terminates if and only if the denominator of the rational number is a product of powers of 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator of the rational number is $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. Therefore, the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ will terminate if and only if $n$ is a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5 = 40$. There are $\\frac{120}{40} = 3$ multiples of 40 between 1 and 120 inclusive, namely 40, 80, and 120.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$."
