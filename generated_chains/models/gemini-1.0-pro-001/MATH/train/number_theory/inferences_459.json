At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be Jane's present age. One year ago, her age was $x - 1$, which was a perfect square, so $x - 1 = a^2$ for some integer $a$. One year from now, her age will be $x + 1$, which will be a perfect cube, so $x + 1 = b^3$ for some integer $b$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $2 = b^3 - a^2$. The only way this can be true is if $b = 2$ and $a = 1$, since $2 = 2^3 - 1^2$. Therefore, $x - 1 = 1^2$, which means $x = 1 + 1 = \\boxed{2}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old."
