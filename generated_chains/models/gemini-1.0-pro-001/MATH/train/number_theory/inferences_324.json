I hope it is correct.'\n\"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graph of $$3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\\le x_0,y_0<35$.\n\nWhat is the value of $x_0+y_0$?",
        "inference": "We can solve the congruence for $x$ to get $x\\equiv \\frac{4y-1}{3}\\pmod{35}$.  Since $x$ is an integer, the numerator $4y-1$ must be divisible by $3$.  The smallest nonnegative integer divisible by $3$ is $3$, so we have $4y-1=3k$ for some integer $k$.  Solving for $y$, we get $y=\\frac{3k+1}{4}$.  Since $y$ is an integer, $3k+1$ must be divisible by $4$.  The smallest nonnegative integer divisible by $4$ is $4$, so we have $3k+1=4l$ for some integer $l$.  Solving for $k$, we get $k=\\frac{4l-1}{3}$.  Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x\\equiv \\frac{4\\left(\\frac{4l-1}{3}\\right)-1}{3}\\equiv \\frac{16l-4-1}{3}\\equiv \\frac{16l-5}{3}\\pmod{35}$.  Since $x$ is an integer, the numerator $16l-5$ must be divisible by $3$.  The smallest nonnegative integer divisible by $3$ is $3$, so we have $16l-5=3m$ for some integer $m$.  Solving for $l$, we get $l=\\frac{3m+5}{16}$.  Substituting this into the expression for $x$, we get $x\\equiv \\frac{16\\left(\\frac{3m+5}{16}\\right)-5}{3}\\equiv \\frac{3m+5-5}{3}\\equiv \\frac{3m}{3}\\equiv m\\pmod{35}$.  Therefore, the $x$-intercept is $(m,0)$.  Similarly, we can solve the congruence for $y$ to get $y\\equiv \\frac{4x+1}{3}\\pmod{35}$, and we can show that the $y$-intercept is $(0,n)$.  The sum of the $x$- and $y$-intercepts is therefore $m+n$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{m+n}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\\equiv 4(0)-1 \\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$. Translating this to the interval $0\\le x<35$, we have $x\\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\\equiv 4y\\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\\equiv 36y\\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\\equiv 9\\pmod{35}$. So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.\n\nWe have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \\boxed{32}$."
