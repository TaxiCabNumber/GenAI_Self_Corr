        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach row of a seating arrangement seats 7 or 8 people. Forty-six people are to be seated. How many rows seat exactly 8 people if every seat is occupied?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of rows that seat 8 people. Then the number of rows that seat 7 people is \\(46-8x\\). The total number of seats is \\( 8x+7(46-8x)= 322 -56x\\). Since this must be equal to 46, we have\n\n$$8x+7(46-8x)= 322 -56x= 46$$\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we get \\( x = 5\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$."
