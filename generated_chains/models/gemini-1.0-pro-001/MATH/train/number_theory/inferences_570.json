Since $5^2$ divides $m!$, the number of factors of $5$ in $m!$ is at least $2$. Thus, the only positive integers $m$ such that $m!$ has exactly $1$ zero at the end is $m=4$. Thus, $4!$ is the only factorial tail less than $1992$. Therefore, there are $1991-1=\\boxed{1990}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1990}$.
