At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
        "inference": "The positive divisors of $400$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $8$, $10$,$ 20$, $25$, $40$, $50$, $100$, and $200$.\nThe sum of these divisors is $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 50 + 100 + 200 = 465$.\nThe prime factors of $465$ are $3$, $5$, and $31$.\nSo the number of distinct prime factors of the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$.

        "ground_truth": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor."
