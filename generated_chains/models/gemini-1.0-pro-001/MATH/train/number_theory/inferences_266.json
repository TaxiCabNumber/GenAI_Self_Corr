At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPalindromes are numbers that read the same backwards and forwards, like 5665. What is the least possible positive four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3?",
