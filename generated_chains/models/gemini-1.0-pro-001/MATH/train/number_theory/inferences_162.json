        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
        "inference": "Since $m$ is a three-digit number, $100 \\le m \\le 999$. Since $m$ is divisible by $10x+y$, $10x+y \\le 9$. Since $y$ is a positive integer less than 10, $x$ must be 0 or 1. If $x=0$, then $y$ must be 1, 2, or 3, and $m$ is not three-digit. Therefore, $x$ must be 1, and $y$ must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. The largest possible value of $m$ occurs when $x=1$ and $y=8$. Therefore, $m=10(1)+8=\\boxed{18}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$."
