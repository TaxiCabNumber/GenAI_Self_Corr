At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "For $\\frac{12}{n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must be a factor of 12.\nThe factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nTherefore, the sum of all integers $n$ such that $\\frac{12}{n}$ is also an integer is $1+2+3+4+6+12=\\boxed{28}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{28}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$. Now from the quadratic formula,\n$n=\\frac{19\\pm \\sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$\nBecause $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$. Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$. Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$. This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\\boxed{38}$."
