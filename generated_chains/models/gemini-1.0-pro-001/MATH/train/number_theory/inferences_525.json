At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf 25,197,624 hot dogs are packaged in sets of 4, how many will be left over?",
        "inference": "First, divide the total number of hot dogs by the number in each set: 25,197,624 \u00f7 4 = 6,299,406. \nNext, multiply the number of sets by the number in each set: 6,299,406 \u00d7 4 = 25,197,624.\nFinally, subtract the total number of hot dogs in the sets from the total number of hot dogs: 25,197,624 - 25,197,624 = 0.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look for the remainder when $25,197,624$ is divided by $4$. We could manually divide to see that $4$ divides evenly into $25,197,624$ for a remainder of $0$, but the quicker way is to know the divisibility rule for $4$. If the last two digits of the number form a multiple of $4$, then the number itself is divisible by $4$.  In this case, $24$ is a multiple of $4$, so $25,197,624$ is also a multiple of $4$. That means $\\boxed{0}$ hot dogs will be left over."
