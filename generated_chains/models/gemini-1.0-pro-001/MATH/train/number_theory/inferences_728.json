At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nJason's first six hours are worth $\\$1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. His next six hours are worth another $\\$21$. His next six hours are worth another $\\$21$. His next six hours are worth another $\\$21$. The remaining three hours are worth $\\$1+2+3=\\$6$. Therefore, Jason borrowed a total of $21\\cdot4+6=\\boxed{\\$90}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$."
