        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors?",
        "inference": "Factors of a number are the positive integers that divide it evenly. The factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The smallest positive integer that has exactly eight distinct positive factors is 24. Its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the smallest positive integer with exactly four factor pairs, we want the number to be divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=\\boxed{24}$."
