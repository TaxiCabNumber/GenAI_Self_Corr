        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTo express 20 as a sum of distinct powers of 2, we would write $20 = 2^4 + 2^2$. The sum of the exponents of these powers is $4 + 2 = 6$. If 1562 were expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, what would be the least possible sum of the exponents of these powers?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFirst, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 1562, which is $2^{10} = 1024$. \n\nThen, we subtract this value from 1562: $1562 - 1024 = 538$. \n\nNext, we find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 538, which is $2^9 = 512$. \n\nWe subtract this value from 538: $538 - 512 = 26$. \n\nWe continue this process until we have subtracted all the powers of 2 necessary to represent 1562. We get:\n\n$1562 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^5 + 2^1$ \n\nThe sum of the exponents of these powers is $10 + 9 + 5 + 1 = \\boxed{25}$.\n\n**Final Answer: 25**. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the uniqueness of the binary representation of positive integers, there is only one way to represent 1562 as a sum of distinct powers of $2$.  To find this representation, we convert 1562 to binary form.  The largest power of $2$ less than 1562 is $2^{10}=1024$.  The difference between 1024 and 1562 is $538$. The largest power of 2 less than 538 is $2^9=512$.  The difference between 538 and 512 is 26.  The largest power of 2 less than 26 is $2^4=16$, which leaves us with $26-16=10$. Continuing the process, we get $2^3=8$ and $2^1=2$. So, we have found that $1562=2^{10}+2^9+2^4+2^3+2^1$.  The sum of the exponents of 2 in this representation is $\\boxed{27}$."
