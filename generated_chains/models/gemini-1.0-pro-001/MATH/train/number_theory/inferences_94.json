At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits of a four-digit positive integer add up to 14. The sum of the two middle digits is nine, and the thousands digit minus the units digit is one. If the integer is divisible by 11, what is the integer?",
        "inference": "Let the integer be $1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, where $a, b, c, d$ are digits.\nWe have the following system of equations:\n\n$$a + b + c + d = 14$$\n$$b + c = 9$$\n$$a - d = 1$$\n$$1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 11k$$ for some integer $k$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $c = 9 - b$.\nFrom the third equation, we have $a = 1 + d$.\nSubstituting these into the first equation, we get\n\n$$1 + d + 9 - b + d + 9 - b + d = 14$$\n$$3d - 2b = 5$$\n$$d - 2b = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n$$d - 2b = 1$$\n$$d = 1 + 2b$$\n\nSubstituting this into the fourth equation, we get\n\n$$1000(1 + d) + 100b + 10(9 - b) + d = 11k$$\n$$1001 + 100d + 100b + 90 - 10b + d = 11k$$\n$$1100 + 101d + 90b = 11k$$\n$$1100 + 11d + 9b = k$$\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, $11d + 9b$ must be divisible by 11.\nThe only possible values of $d$ and $b$ that satisfy this are $d = 4$ and $b = 5$.\nSubstituting these into the first equation, we get\n\n$$1 + 4 + 9 - 5 + 4 = 14$$\n\nSo the integer is $1459$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1459}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the integer be $abcd$.  We know that \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d&=14,\\\\\nb+c&=9,\\\\\na-d&=1.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a+d=5$.  Adding this to the third equation, we get $$2a=6\\Rightarrow a=3$$ Substituting this into the third equation, we get $d=2$.\n\nNow, the fact that the integer is divisible by $11$ means that $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$.  Substituting in the values for $a$ and $d$, this means that $1-b+c$ is divisible by $11$.  If this quantity was a positive or negative multiple of $11$, either $b$ or $c$ would need to be greater than $9$, so we must have $1-b+c=0$.
