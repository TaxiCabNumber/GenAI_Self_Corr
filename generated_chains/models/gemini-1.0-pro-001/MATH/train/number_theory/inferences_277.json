        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a class of math students lined up for a class picture on Picture Day, they found that when they stood in rows of four there was one person left over. When they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and when they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over. What is the fewest number of students possible in this class?",
        "inference": "Let's call the number of students \"$x$\".\n\nWhen they lined up in rows of four there was one person left over, so $x$ is not divisible by 4.\n\nWhen they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, so $x$ is not divisible by 5, but it is divisible by 5-2=3.\n\nWhen they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over, so $x$ is not divisible by 7, but it is divisible by 7-3=4.\n\nSo, $x$ is not divisible by 4 or 5, but it is divisible by 3 and 4. The smallest number that is divisible by 3 and 4 is 12. We can check if 12 satisfies all the conditions:\n\nWhen they lined up in rows of four there was one person left over, and $12-1=11$, which is not divisible by 4.\n\nWhen they formed rows of five students, there were two extra students, and $12+2=14$, which is divisible by 5.\n\nWhen they lined up in rows of seven, there were three students left over, and $12-3=9$, which is not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, the smallest possible number of students in the class is 12.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first two pieces of information imply that the number of students is 1 more than a multiple of 4 and 2 more than a multiple of 5. Checking numbers that are 2 more than a multiple of 5, we find that 2, 7, and 12 are not 1 more than a multiple of 4, but 17 does satisfy this condition. Moreover, 17 is also three more than a multiple of 7. Thus $\\boxed{17}$ is the least positive integer satisfying all three conditions.\n\nRemark: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers satisfying the given conditions are of the form $17 + \\text{lcm}(4,5,7)k = 17+140k$, where $k$ is an integer."
