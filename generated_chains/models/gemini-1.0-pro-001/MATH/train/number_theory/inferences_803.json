I hope it is correct.'\nKarlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of marbles in each box. Since each box contains more than one marble, $x>1$. Since there is more than one box, $m>1$. Since there are 600 marbles in total, $600=mx$. Solving for $m$, we get $m=\\frac{600}{x}$. Since $x>1$ and $m$ is an integer, $m$ can only be an integer if $x$ is a factor of 600. The factors of 600 are $1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,25,30,50,60,100,120,150,200,300,$ and $600$. Of these factors, only $2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,25,30,50,$ and $60$ are greater than $1$ and less than $600$. Therefore, $m$ can be $2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,25,30,50,$ and $60$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$."
