Then, count the number of factors for each prime factor:\n4. 2 has 2 factors (1 and 2)\n5. 3 has 2 factors (1 and 3)\n6. 5 has 2 factors (1 and 5)\n7. Multiply the number of factors for each prime factor to get the total number of factors:\n8. 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30."
