        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaniel has exactly $20$ pieces of candy. He has to divide them equally among his $3$ sisters. What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find how many pieces of candy Daniel has to give to each of his sisters. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of sisters:\n\n$$20 \\div 3 = 6\\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nSince Daniel cannot give away a fraction of a piece of candy, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. So, he needs to give each sister $7$ pieces of candy.\n\nNext, we need to find how many pieces of candy Daniel needs to take away. To do this, we subtract the number of pieces of candy he needs to give to each sister from the total number of pieces of candy he has:\n\n$$20 - 7 = 13$$\n\nTherefore, Daniel needs to take away $\\boxed{13}$ pieces of candy.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces."
