At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

What is the largest number of members such a subset can have?\n$\\text{(A) } 50\\quad \\text{(B) } 66\\quad \\text{(C) } 67\\quad \\text{(D) } 76\\quad \\text{(E) } 78$\n",

Thus, the subset can have at most $33$ members, since $66$ is the largest multiple of $3$ that is not more than $100$. However, a subset with $33$ members is possible, for example, take the set of the numbers not divisible by $3$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{33}$. I hope it is correct.",

This provides a total of $100 - 34 + 1$ = 67 solutions.\nFurther analyzation of the remaining integers between $1$ and $10$, we notice that we can include all the numbers except $3$ (as including $3$ would force us to remove both $9$ and $1$) to obtain the maximum number of $9$ solutions.\nThus, $67 + 9 = \\boxed{76}$."
