        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nTo find the number of pieces in each bag, we need to find a multiple of 9 that is 7 more than a multiple of 9.\nThe smallest multiple of 9 that is 7 more than a multiple of 9 is $9 \\cdot 2 + 7 = 25$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over is $25 - 9 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $1$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
