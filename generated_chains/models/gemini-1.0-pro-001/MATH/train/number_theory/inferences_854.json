At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The prime numbers between 1 and 50 that are multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. So, there are 6 such numbers.\nThe probability of selecting one of these 6 numbers is 6/50 = 3/25.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{25}$. I hope it is correct.}",
        "ground_truth": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$."
