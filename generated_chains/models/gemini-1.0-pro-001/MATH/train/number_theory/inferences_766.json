        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe time right now is exactly midnight. What time will it be in 1234 minutes?",
        "inference": "In 1234 minutes, it will be 8:34 AM.\n\n1234 minutes is equal to 20 hours and 34 minutes. \nMidnight is 00:00, so adding 20 hours would make it 20:00. \nAdding 34 minutes to that would make it 20:34, which is 8:34 AM.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{08:34 AM}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When $1234$ is divided by $60$, you get $20$ with a remainder of $34$. Therefore, the time in $1234$ minutes will be $\\boxed{20\\!:\\!34}$ or $\\boxed{8\\!:\\!34 \\text{ p.m.}}$."
