At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKate has saved up $4444_8$ dollars for a trip to France. A round-trip airline ticket costs $1000_{10}$ dollars. In base ten, how many dollars will she have left for lodging and food?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Convert $4444_8$ to base 10.\n\n4 * 8^3 + 4 * 8^2 + 4 * 8^1 + 4 * 8^0 = 2048 + 256 + 32 + 4 = **2340**\n\n**Step 2**: Subtract the cost of the airline ticket.\n\n2340 - 1000 = **1340**\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1340}$. I hope it is correct.**",
