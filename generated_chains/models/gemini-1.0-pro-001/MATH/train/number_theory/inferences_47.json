I hope it is correct.'\nWhen $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
        "inference": "The question is asking for the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$.\n\nWe can start by converting $11^4$ to base $b$. We can use the following formula to convert a number from base $a$ to base $b$:\n\n```\nN_b = N_a * a^(n-1) + N_a * a^(n-2) + ... + N_a * a^0\n```\n\nwhere $N_a$ is the number in base $a$, $N_b$ is the number in base $b$, and $n$ is the number of digits in the number.\n\nIn this case, we have $N_a = 11^4$ and $a = 10$. We want to find the largest $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$.\n\nWe can start by trying different values of $b$. We can start with $b = 2$ and see if the base-$2$ digits of $11^4$ add up to $2^4$.\n\n```\n11^4 = 14641 in base 10\n11^4 = 111000100001 in base 2\n```\n\nThe base-$2$ digits of $11^4$ add up to $8$, which is not equal to $2^4$. Therefore, $b = 2$ is not the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$.\n\nWe can continue trying different values of $b$ until we find the largest value of $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$.\n\nWe can use a computer program to try different values of $b$ and find the largest value of $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$.\n\nThe largest value of $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$ is $b = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$."
