At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6?",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$."
