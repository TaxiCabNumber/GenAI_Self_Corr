At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "The base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square if and only if there is an integer $x$ such that $23_b = x^2$. This is equivalent to $2b + 3 = x^2$, or $x^2 - 2b = 3$. Since $x$ is an integer, $x^2 - 2b$ must be a multiple of $3$. The smallest positive multiple of $3$ that is greater than $2b$ is $3b$, so we have $x^2 - 2b = 3b$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = x^2/5$. Since $x$ is an integer, $x^2$ is a perfect square. The smallest perfect square that is greater than $3\\cdot5 = 15$ is $16$, so the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square is $16/5 = 3.2$. However, $b$ must be an integer, so the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{4}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer."
