At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?",
        "inference": "Since $n$ is between 20 and 30, $n$ must be one of 23, 29.\n\n23 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 7, not 5, so 23 is not the answer.\n\n29 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 5, so the answer is 29.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$29$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number."
