At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind a positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3.",
        "inference": "The square root of 25 is 5, and the square root of 25.3 is approximately 5.03. We are looking for a positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 5 and 5.03.\nThe smallest positive integer that is divisible by 14 is 14. The square root of 14 is approximately 3.74, which is less than 5. So, 14 is not the answer.\nThe next positive integer that is divisible by 14 is 28. The square root of 28 is approximately 5.29, which is greater than 5.03. So, 28 is also not the answer.\nThe only other positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 5 and 5.03 is $\\boxed{42}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{42}$. I hope it is correct.",
