        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
        "inference": "The smallest abundant number is 12. Multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ....  So, the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 is 20.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
