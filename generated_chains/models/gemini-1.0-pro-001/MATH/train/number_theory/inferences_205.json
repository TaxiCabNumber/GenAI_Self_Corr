        "inference": "The smallest even digit is 2, and the smallest odd digit is 1. The smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 1022.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 1022 is 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 5, which is not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 1202.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 1202 is 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 1220.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 1220 is 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2012.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2012 is 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2021.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2021 is 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2102.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2102 is 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2120.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2120 is 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2201.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2201 is 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 2210.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 2210 is 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 5, which is still not divisible by 9. The next smallest positive four-digit number that can be formed with two even and two odd digits is 1023.\n\nThe sum of the digits of 1023 is 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is divisible by 9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1023}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$."
