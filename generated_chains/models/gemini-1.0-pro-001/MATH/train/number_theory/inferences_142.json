At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $N$ is the smallest positive integer with the desired property, it must be divisible by the least common multiple of $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. The prime factorization of each of these numbers is:\n\\begin{align*}\n2^2&=2^2\\\\\n3^2&=3^2\\\\\n5^2&=5^2\\\\\n7^2&=7^2.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, the least common multiple of these numbers is:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}(2^2,3^2,5^2,7^2) &= 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2\\\\\n&= 4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 49\\\\\n&= 44100.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer with the desired property is $N=44100$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{44100}.

        "ground_truth": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$."
