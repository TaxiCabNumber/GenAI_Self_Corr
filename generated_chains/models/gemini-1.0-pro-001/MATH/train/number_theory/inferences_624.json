Therefore $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r$ is also divisible by $3$.  On the other hand, since $3^3 = 27$, we see that $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r$ must be greater than $2$, and since $3^4 = 81$, we have $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r \\ge 4$.  In particular, we have $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r \\ge 6$.\n\nNow suppose that there exists $k$ such that $n_k \\ge 4$.

In particular, $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r \\le 3r$.  Combining the two inequalities, we have\\[6 \\le n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r \\le 3r\\]and since $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r$ is divisible by $3$, the only possibility is $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r = 6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.
