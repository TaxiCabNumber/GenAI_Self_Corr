        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
        "inference": "Let the two-digit number be $xy$ and the three-digit number be $uvw$. Then the number formed by placing the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number is $xyuvw$.\n\nWe are told that $xyuvw = 9*xy*uvw$.\n\nDividing both sides by $xy*uvw$, we get\n\n$\\frac{xyuvw}{xy*uvw}=\\frac{9*xy*uvw}{xy*uvw}$\n\n$1=9$\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution to the problem.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{No \\ solution.}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$."
