Since $3^{n+k+1} - 3^n$ is divisible by $3$, $S$ must be divisible by $3$. The largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^{11}$ is expressible as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers is the largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^{11}$ is divisible by $3$. The largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^n$ is divisible by $3$ is $n-1$, so the largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^{11}$ is expressible as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers is $11-1=\\boxed{10}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
