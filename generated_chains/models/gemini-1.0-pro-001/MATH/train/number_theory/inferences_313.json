At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward. For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes. What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?",
        "inference": "- Let $x$ be the least natural number when added to 40305 makes it a palindrome.\n\n- To make it palindrome, $x$ must be a number less than or equal to 9999.\n\n- So, the new number is $40305 + x$, which should be a palindrome.\n\n- If we add $x$ to 40305, the only place where it can affect making the number a palindrome is at the last two digits. \n\n- Therefore, we only need to check if the last two digits of $40305 + x$ are the same.\n\n- The last two digits of $40305$ are $05$.\n\n- So, the last two digits of $40305 + x$ should be $05$ for it to be a palindrome.\n\n- The smallest natural number that can be added to $40305$ to make the last two digits $05$ is $95$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{95}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$."
