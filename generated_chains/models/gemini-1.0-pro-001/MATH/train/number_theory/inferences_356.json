At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16?",
        "inference": "The largest four-digit number is 9999. The sum of its digits is 9+9+9+9=36, which is greater than 16.\n\nThe largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 is 9871. The sum of its digits is 9+8+7+1=25, which is less than 16.\n\nTherefore, there is no four-digit number whose digits add up to 16.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{None}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$."
