At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct four-digit numbers are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: To be divisible by 3 the sum of the digits must be divisible by 3. The sum of 2 and 3 is 5, so the sum of the first two digits must be divisible by 3. \n\n**Step 2**: The digits can be 1, 4, 7 or 10, 13, 16, or 19. \n\n**Step 3**: There are 4 choices for the first digit and 3 choices for the second digit. So, there are 12 possibilities for the first two digits. \n\n**Step 4**: So, there are 12 distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3."
