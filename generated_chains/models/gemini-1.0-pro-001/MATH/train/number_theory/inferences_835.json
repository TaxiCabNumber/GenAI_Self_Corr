At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- Perfect cubes less than $555$ are $1^3=1,2^3=8,3^3=27,4^3=64,5^3=125,$ so these numbers are $1,8,27,64,125$.\n- Perfect squares less than $555$ are $1^2=1,2^2=4,3^2=9,4^2=16,5^2=25,6^2=36,7^2=49,8^2=64,9^2=81,10^2=100,11^2=121,12^2=144,13^2=169,14^2=196,15^2=225,16^2=256,17^2=289,18^2=324,19^2=361,20^2=400,21^2=441,22^2=484,23^2=529.$\n- The perfect squares that are not perfect cubes are $4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169,196,225,256,289,324,361,400,441,484,529$.

        "ground_truth": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square."
