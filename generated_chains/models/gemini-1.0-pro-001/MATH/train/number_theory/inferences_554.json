        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated. The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$. If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$. Play the role of the magician and determine $(abc)$ if $N= 3194$.\n",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $S=a+b+c$ be the sum of the digits of $(abc)$. Then, the sum of the five numbers formed is \\begin{align*}\nN&= (abc)+(acb)+(bca)+(bac)+(cab)+(cba)\\\\\n&= 100(a+b+c)+10(a+b+c)+a+b+c\\\\\n&=(111)S\\\\\n&= 3194.\n\\end{align*}\nThus $S=\\boxed{28}$. Since $28$ is the sum of the digits of $982$, the original number must have been $\\boxed{982}$. (it is the only three digit number whose digits sum to 28.)\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{982}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality."
