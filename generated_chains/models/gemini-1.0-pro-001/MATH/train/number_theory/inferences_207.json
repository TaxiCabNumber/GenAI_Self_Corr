At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2}\\times223$. How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ satisfy the equation $xy=2007$?",
        "inference": "Since the prime factorization of 2007 is $3^{2} \\times 223$, any factor of 2007 must be of the form $3^{a} \\times 223^{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers.\nTo find the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ such that $xy=2007$, we need to find all possible combinations of $a$ and $b$ such that $3^{a} \\times 223^{b}=2007$.\nSince $2007=3^{2} \\times 223$, we have $a=2$ and $b=1$.\nTherefore, there is only one possible ordered pair $(x,y)$ such that $xy=2007$, which is $(x,y)=(3^{2},223)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs."
