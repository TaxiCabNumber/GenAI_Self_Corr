        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?",
        "inference": "There are $9$ perfect squares from $1$ to $150$: $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81$.\n\nThere are $4$ perfect cubes from $1$ to $150$: $1, 8, 27, 64$.\n\nSo, there are $9+4-2=11$ numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nTherefore, there are $150-11=\\boxed{139}$ numbers from $1$ to $150$ that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{139}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube."
