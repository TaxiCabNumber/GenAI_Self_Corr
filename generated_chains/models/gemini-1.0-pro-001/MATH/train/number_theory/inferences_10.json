Each of these values must be the cube of another integer.\n\n$841=11^3$\n\n$900=10^3$\n\n$676,729,784$ are not cubes of integers.\n\nSo, $K$ can be either 10 or 11.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$K=10$ or $K=11$}.

        "ground_truth": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$"
