        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe time right now is 9 o'clock. On a 12-hour clock, what time will it be 2004 hours from now?",
        "inference": "Since there are 12 hours in a 12-hour clock, we need to divide 2004 by 12 to find how many 12-hour periods have passed. \n2004 \u00f7 12 = 167\nMultiply the number of 12-hour periods by 12 to find the number of hours that have passed.\n167 \u00d7 12 = 2004\nSubtract the number of hours that have passed from 9 to find the time now.\n9 - 2004 = -1995\nSince the result is a negative number, we need to add 12 to find the time in a 12-hour clock.\n-1995 + 12 = 3\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that 2004 is divisible by 4, since the last two digits, 04, form a multiple of 4.  Also, 2004 is divisible by 3 since the sum of the digits, $2+0+0+4=6$, is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, 2004 is a multiple of 12, and 2004 hours from now it will be $\\boxed{9}$ o'clock again."
