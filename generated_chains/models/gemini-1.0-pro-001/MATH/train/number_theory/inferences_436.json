At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive positive integers be x and x + 1. Then, x(x + 1) = 210. Expanding the left side, we get x^2 + x = 210. Rearranging, we get x^2 + x - 210 = 0. Factoring, we get (x - 14)(x + 15) = 0. Therefore, x = 14 or x = -15. Since x is a positive integer, x = 14. The two consecutive positive integers are 14 and 15. \n\nNow, let the three consecutive integers be y, y + 1, and y + 2. Then, y(y + 1)(y + 2) = 210. Expanding the left side, we get y^3 + 3y^2 + 2y = 210. Rearranging, we get y^3 + 3y^2 + 2y - 210 = 0. Factoring, we get (y - 7)(y^2 + 10y + 30) = 0. Therefore, y = 7 or y = -10 or y = -3. Since y is a positive integer, y = 7. The three consecutive integers are 7, 8, and 9. \n\nThe sum of the five integers is 14 + 15 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 53.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{53}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$."
