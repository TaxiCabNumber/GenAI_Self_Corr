At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the two-digit integer $MM$, with equal digits, is multiplied by the one-digit integer $M$, the result is the three-digit integer $NPM$. What is the greatest possible value of $NPM$?",
        "inference": "The greatest two-digit number with equal digits is $MM=99$. The smallest one-digit number is $M=1$, and the greatest is $M=9$. Therefore, the greatest possible product is $99 \\times 9 = 891$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{891}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$."
