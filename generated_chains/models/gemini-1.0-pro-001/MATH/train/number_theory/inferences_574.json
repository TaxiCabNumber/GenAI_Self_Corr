At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right rectangular prism $P$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\\le b\\le c.$ A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P$ cuts $P$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P,$ and both of which have nonzero volume. Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?\n",
        "inference": "Since $b=1995,$ a plane that intersects $P$ to produce a similar prism cuts the square face of $P$ that contains $a$ and $b,$ and cuts the opposite square face so that the cut segment is parallel to $b.$  Thus, $a\\mid b,$ i.e., $a=1995k,$ where $k$ is an integer.  If $a\\ne 1995,$ then $k$ is a positive divisor of $1995$ different from $1$ and $1995,$ so $k=3$ or $k=5.$  Thus, there are two possible triples $(a,b,c)$ if $a\\ne 1995.$\n\nIf $a=1995,$ then a plane that produces a similar prism can cut the square face of $P$ that contains $b$ and $c,$ or cut the opposite square face so that the cut segment is parallel to $b.$  Since all three sides are of integral length, the square face of $P$ that contains $b$ and $c$ cannot be cut to produce a smaller prism with the same shape, so the second option is the only one possible.  Thus, $c\\mid b,$ i.e., $c=1995\\ell,$ where $\\ell$ is an integer.  If $c\\ne 1995,$ then $\\ell$ is a positive divisor of $1995$ different from $1$ and $1995,$ so $\\ell=3$ or $\\ell=5.$  Thus, if $a=1995,$ then there are two possible triples $(a,b,c).$\n\nIn total, there are $\\boxed{4}$ possible ordered triples $(a,b,c).$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $P'$ be the prism similar to $P$, and let the sides of $P'$ be of length $x,y,z$, such that $x \\le y \\le z$. Then\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{y}{b} = \\frac zc < 1.\\]\nNote that if the ratio of similarity was equal to $1$, we would have a prism with zero volume. As one face of $P'$ is a face of $P$, it follows that $P$ and $P'$ share at least two side lengths in common. Since $x < a, y < b, z < c$, it follows that the only possibility is $y=a,z=b=1995$. Then,\n\\[\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{a}{1995} = \\frac{1995}{c} \\Longrightarrow ac = 1995^2 = 3^25^27^219^2.\\]\nThe number of factors of $3^25^27^219^2$ is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 81$. Only in $\\left\\lfloor \\frac {81}2 \\right\\rfloor = 40$ of these cases is $a < c$ (for $a=c$, we end with a prism of zero volume).
