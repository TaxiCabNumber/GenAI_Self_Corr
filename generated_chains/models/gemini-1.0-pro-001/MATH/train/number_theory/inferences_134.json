        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
        "inference": "Let the number of members in a band be \\(x\\), which is a multiple of 8 and 9. So, there are common multiples of 8 and 9 between 100 and 200, we have:\n$$144, 162.$$\nSince there are 2 unoccupied positions in the first formation and 3 unoccupied positions in the second formation, the number of rows should be 2 more than a multiple of 8, and 3 more than a multiple of 9. The only number that satisfies both conditions is 162.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$162$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members."
