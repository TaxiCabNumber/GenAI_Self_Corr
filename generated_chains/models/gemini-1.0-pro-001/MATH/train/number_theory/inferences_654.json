        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S(n)$ equal the sum of the digits of positive integer $n$. For example, $S(1507) = 13$. For a particular positive integer $n$, $S(n) = 1274$. Which of the following could be the value of $S(n+1)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 12\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1239\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1265$\n",
        "inference": "Since $S(n)=1274$, the sum of the digits of $n$ is 7. Adding 1 to $n$ will increase the sum of the digits of $n$ by 1, so $S(n+1)$ will be $1274 + 1 = \\boxed{1275}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1275}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $n \\equiv S(n) \\pmod{9}$. This can be seen from the fact that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}10^{k}a_k \\equiv \\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_k \\pmod{9}$. Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$, and thus $n+1 \\equiv S(n+1) \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. The only answer choice that is $6 \\pmod{9}$ is $\\boxed{1239}$."
