        "inference": "Let $p$ be a prime number such that there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$. Then $3$ is not a unit modulo $p$, so $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ (since $p$ is odd).\n\nAs $p\\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, we have $p=3k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then we can rewrite the congruence as $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod{3k+1}$.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get $18x+3\\equiv 4\\pmod{3k+1}$.\n\nSubtracting $3$ from both sides, we get $18x\\equiv 1\\pmod{3k+1}$.\n\nAs $3$ is not a unit modulo $3k+1$, we must have $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{3k+1}$.\n\nBut $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, so we have $3k+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, which implies that $k\\equiv -1\\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $k=-1+3m$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this into the expression for $p$, we get $p=3k+1=3(-1+3m)+1=9m-2$.\n\nAs $p$ is a prime number, it must be of the form $p=3$ or $p=9m-2$ for some integer $m>0$.\n\nIf $p=3$, then there is no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence, so $p$ satisfies the desired condition.\n\nIf $p=9m-2$, then we can rewrite the congruence as $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod{9m-2}$.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get $18x+3\\equiv 4\\pmod{9m-2}$.\n\nSubtracting $3$ from both sides, we get $18x\\equiv 1\\pmod{9m-2}$.\n\nAs $3$ is not a unit modulo $9m-2$, we must have $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{9m-2}$.\n\nBut $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, so we have $9m-2\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, which implies that $m\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $m=2+3n$ for some integer $n$. Substituting this into the expression for $p$, we get $p=9m-2=9(2+3n)-2=18+27n-2=16+27n$.\n\nAs $p$ is a prime number, it must be of the form $p=16+27n$ for some integer $n>0$.\n\nWe now consider the two cases separately:\n\nCase 1: $p=16$\n\nIf $p=16$, then the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod{16}$ has integer solutions, so $16$ does not satisfy the desired condition.\n\nCase 2: $p=16+27n$ with $n>0$\n\nIf $p=16+27n$ with $n>0$, then we can rewrite the congruence as $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod{16+27n}$.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get $18x+3\\equiv 4\\pmod{16+27n}$.\n\nSubtracting $3$ from both sides, we get $18x\\equiv 1\\pmod{16+27n}$.\n\nAs $3$ is not a unit modulo $16+27n$, we must have $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{16+27n}$.\n\nBut $18\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, so we have $16+27n\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, which implies that $n\\equiv -16\\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $n=-16+3m$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this into the expression for $p$, we get $p=16+27n=16+27(-16+3m)=448-729m$.\n\nAs $p$ is a prime number, it must be of the form $p=448-729m$ for some integer $m>0$.\n\nTherefore, the only prime numbers that satisfy the desired condition are $p=3$ and $p=448-729m$ for any integer $m>0$.\n\nThe sum of all such prime numbers is $3+448-729(1)+448-729(2)+\\cdots = 3+448-729+448-729+\\cdots = 3+896-1458+896-1458+\\cdots = 3+\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 896-1458n$.\n\nAs the sum of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 896-1458n$ is $3$, the sum of all prime numbers that satisfy the desired condition is $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.
