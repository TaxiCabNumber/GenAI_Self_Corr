For the first case, $n+1/2=\\pm1$, thus $n=0$ or $n=1$. However, neither $235236_0$ nor $235236_1$ is a multiple of $7$. For the next cases, $n+1/2=\\pm2$, thus $n=3/2$ or $n=-3/2$. However, $n$ must be an integer, there is no such $n$. For the next cases, $n+1/2=\\pm3$, thus $n=5/2$ or $n=-7/2$. However, $n$ must be an integer, there is no such $n$. Similarly, there is no such $n$ for the next cases $n+1/2=\\pm4,\\pm5,\\cdots,\\pm24$.\n\nNext, we check the other condition, when $2n+3$ is a multiple of $7$. We have $2n+3\\equiv 2n-4\\pmod{7}$.

Trying $n=2,9,16,23,\\cdots,97$, we find that $235236_n$ is a multiple of $7$ when $n=2,9,16,23,30,37,44,51,58,65,72,79,86,93$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$14$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "This is true if and only if $f(n):=6+3n+2n^2+5n^3+3n^4+2n^5$ is a multiple of $7$. Whether or not this is true depends only on $n$ modulo $7$. First note that the polynomial is congruent to $2n^5+3n^4+5n^3+2n^2+3n-15$ modulo $7$, which has $1$ as a root. Factoring, we get \\[2n^5+3n^4+5n^3+2n^2+3n-15=(n-1)(2n^4+5n^3+10n^2+12n+15).\\]Next we check each residue modulo $7$, i.e. we check this for $n=2,3,-1,-2,-3$. Since $n-1$ is not a multiple of $7$ when $n$ is not congruent to $1$ modulo $7$, we need only check the quartic factor. When $n=2$, we get $2(16)+5(8)+10(4)+12(2)+15=32+40+40+24+15=112+39=151$, which is not a multiple of $7$. When $n=-1$, we get $15-12+10-5+2=10$, which is not a multiple of $7$. When $n=-2$, we get \\[32-40+40-24+15=32+15-24=8+15=23,\\]which is not a multiple of $7$.

Finally, when $n=-3$, we get $162-135+90-36+15=338-2(135)-2(36)=438-270-72=168-72=96$, which is again not a multiple of $7$. Thus the only possible $n$ are those congruent to $1$ modulo $7$, and furthermore note that $n \\ge 7$ since $6$ is a digit.
