At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integers $n$ does $\\frac{1}{n}$ yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** If the hundredths digit is non-zero, then $n$ must be a multiple of $10^2=100$.\n\n**Step 2:** The only multiples of $100$ that yield a terminating decimal are those that are also multiples of $2^2=4$, since $2$ and $5$ are the only prime factors of $100$.\n\n**Step 3:** Therefore, $n$ must be a multiple of $400$.\n\n**Step 4:** The positive integers less than $400$ that are multiples of $400$ are $400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, 2800, 3200, 3600$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$. Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$. Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100. One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc. Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however. For $n\\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero. Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero. Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \\boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point."
