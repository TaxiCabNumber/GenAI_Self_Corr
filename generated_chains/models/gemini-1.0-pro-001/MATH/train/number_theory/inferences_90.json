At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
        "inference": "The least number of rows is 10, and the least number of students in each row is 15. So, the least possible number of students is 10  \u00d7  15  =  150. The greatest number of rows is 288  \u00f7  15  =  19.2. Since the number of rows must be a whole number, the greatest number of rows is 19. So, the greatest possible number of students in each row is 288  \u00f7  19  =  15.15789... . Since the number of students in each row must be a whole number, the greatest number of students in each row is 15. Therefore, the possible values of x are 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. The sum of these values is 15  +  16  +  17  +  18  +  19  =  85.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{85}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$."
