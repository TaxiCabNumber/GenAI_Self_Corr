        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $n$ is a multiple of $75$, we can write $n=75k$ for some positive integer $k$.  Then, the number of positive integral divisors of $n$ is the same as the number of positive integral divisors of $75k$.  The prime factorization of $75$ is $75=3\\cdot5^2$.  Therefore, the number of positive integral divisors of $75$ is $(1+1)(1+2)=3\\cdot3=9$.  Since $9\\neq75$, we must have $k>1$.  The prime factorization of $k$ is of the form $k=2^a3^b5^c$, where $a,b,c$ are nonnegative integers.  The number of positive integral divisors of $k$ is $(1+a)(1+b)(1+c)$.  Therefore, the number of positive integral divisors of $n$ is $(1+a)(1+b)(1+c)\\cdot9$.  We want this to be equal to $75$.  Since $(1+a)(1+b)(1+c)$ is a positive integer, we must have $(1+a)(1+b)(1+c)=75/9=25/3$.  The only positive integer that is a multiple of $3$ and is less than $25/3$ is $3$.  Therefore, $(1+a)(1+b)(1+c)=3$.  Since $1+a$ is a positive integer, we must have $1+a=1$ or $1+a=3$.  If $1+a=1$, then $a=0$.  If $1+a=3$, then $a=2$.  If $a=0$, then $1+b=3$, so $b=2$.  If $a=2$, then $1+b=1$, so $b=0$.  Therefore, the only possible solutions are $(a,b,c)=(0,2,0)$ and $(a,b,c)=(2,0,0)$.  If $(a,b,c)=(0,2,0)$, then $k=2^03^25^0=9$.  If $(a,b,c)=(2,0,0)$, then $k=2^23^05^0=4$.  Therefore, the only possible values of $n$ are $n=75\\cdot9$ and $n=75\\cdot4$.  Since $n$ is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $75$ and has exactly $75$ positive integral divisors, we must have $n=75\\cdot4$.  Therefore, $\\frac{n}{75}=\\frac{75\\cdot4}{75}=4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $75 = 3^15^2 = (2+1)(4+1)(4+1)$. For $n$ to have exactly $75$ integral divisors, we need to have $n = p_1^{e_1-1}p_2^{e_2-1}\\cdots$ such that $e_1e_2 \\cdots = 75$. Since $75|n$, two of the prime factors must be $3$ and $5$. To minimize $n$, we can introduce a third prime factor, $2$. Also to minimize $n$, we want $5$, the greatest of all the factors, to be raised to the least power.
