Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works. Finally, if $n$ is any other composite integer, it can be written as the product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Since $n \\le 25$, $n$ cannot be the product of three distinct primes, so $n = p^aq^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.
