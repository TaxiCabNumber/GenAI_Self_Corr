At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $j$ is a positive integer and the expression $(7j+3)$ is multiplied by 3 and then divided by 7, what is the remainder?",

        "ground_truth": "First we multiply $(7j+3)$ by 3 to get $21j+9$. Now we divide by 7 and get $$\\frac{21j+9}{7}=3j+\\frac{9}{7}=3j+1+\\frac{2}{7}.$$ Since $j$ is an integer, we know that $3j+1$ is also an integer.
