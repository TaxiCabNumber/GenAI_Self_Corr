At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert 87 to base 2.\n$$87_{10}=1010111_2$$\nSo, 87 has 7 digits in base 2.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert 87 to base 3.\n$$87_{10}=90_3$$\nSo, 87 has 2 digits in base 3.\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the number of digits in base 3 from the number of digits in base 2.\n$$7-2=5$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.  The difference between 7 digits and 5 digits is $\\boxed{2}$ digits."
