        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLinda, Sherry, June, and Connie walked around their neighborhoods selling girl scout cookies. Linda earned $\\$27.47$, Sherry earned $\\$35.23$, June earned $\\$37.37$, and Connie earned $\\$26.52$. After the sale, they pooled their money together and went to the bank to convert the coins into dollars. How much money, in cents, was left after they converted as many of the coins into bills as they could?",
        "inference": "1. Convert each girl's earnings into cents:\n\nLinda: $27.47 x 100 = 2747$ cents\nSherry: $35.23 x 100 = 3523$ cents\nJune: $37.37 x 100 = 3737$ cents\nConnie: $26.52 x 100 = 2652$ cents\n\n2. Add the girls' earnings together to find the total amount of cents:\n\n2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12,659 cents\n\n3. Divide the total amount of cents by 100 to find the number of dollars:\n\n12,659 cents / 100 = 126 dollars\n\n4. Subtract the number of dollars from the total amount of cents to find the amount of cents left over:\n\n12,659 cents - 12600 cents = 59 cents\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{59}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Instead of adding large numbers together, we can find the residue for each person for easier computation. We convert the amount they earned to cents and find the modulo $100$ for each.  \\begin{align*}\n2747 &\\equiv 47 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3523 &\\equiv 23 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n3737 &\\equiv 37 \\pmod{100},\\\\\n2652 &\\equiv 52 \\pmod{100}\n\\end{align*}We want to find the modulo $100$ of the total number of cents. We can add the separate residues to get $$47+23+37+52 \\equiv 159 \\equiv 59 \\pmod{100}$$Therefore, they have $\\boxed{59}$ cents left after converting as much of the money into bills as possible."
