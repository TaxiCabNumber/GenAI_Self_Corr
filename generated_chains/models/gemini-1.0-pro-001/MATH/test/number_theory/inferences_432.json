        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 4641 can be expressed as the product of two 2-digit whole numbers. What is the sum of these two numbers?",
        "inference": "4641 is the product of 69 and 67.\n4641 = 69 x 67\nSum of 69 and 67 is 136.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{136}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$4641$ has a prime factorization of $4641=3\\cdot 7\\cdot 13\\cdot 17$. Multiplying any $3$ of its prime factors yields a number that is greater than $100$, so the two $2$-digit numbers must each be the product of $2$ of its prime factors. The only other prime factor $17$ can be multiplied by without getting a $3$-digit number is $3$, so one of them must be $17\\cdot3=51$. That makes the other $7\\cdot13=91$. $51+91=\\boxed{142}$."
