At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the tens digit of $5^{2005}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFirst, find the remainder when $2005$ is divided by $4$: $2005 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\nSince $5^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, we have $5^{2005} \\equiv 5^1 \\equiv \\boxed{5} \\pmod{10}$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Note that for $n\\geq 2$, the last two digits of $5^n$ are 25.  To prove this, note that $5^2\\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$, and whenever $5^{n-1}\\equiv 25\\pmod{100}$, we also have $5^n=5\\cdot 5^{n-1}\\equiv 5\\cdot 25 \\equiv 125 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{100}$.
