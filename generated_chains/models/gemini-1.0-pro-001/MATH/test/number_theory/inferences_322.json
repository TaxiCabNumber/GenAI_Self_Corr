        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers?",
        "inference": "Let the consecutive integers be $n-1, n, n+1$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Then, we have \\begin{align*}\nn^3&=(n-1)^3+n^3+(n+1)^3\\\\\n&=n^3-3n^2+3n-1+n^3+n^3+3n^2+3n+1\\\\\n&=3n^3+6n\\\\\n&=3n(n^2+2)\n\\end{align*} Since $n^2+2$ is always greater than 1, we must have $n=1$. Therefore, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers is $1^3=\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of three consecutive integers takes the form $(k-1)+(k)+(k+1)=3k$ and hence is a multiple of 3.  Conversely, if a number $n$ is a multiple of 3, then $n/3-1$, $n/3$, and $n/3+1$ are three consecutive integers that sum to give $n$.  Therefore, a number is a sum of three consecutive integers if and only if it is a multiple of 3.  The smallest positive perfect cube that is a multiple of 3 is $3^3=\\boxed{27}$."
