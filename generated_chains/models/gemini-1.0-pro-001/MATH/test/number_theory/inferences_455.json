        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$?",
        "inference": "Since $\\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we have $a=210^m$ and $b=210^n$ for some integers $m$ and $n$ with $n>m$. Thus, $$\\frac{210^n}{210^m}=210^{n-m}=210^3.$$It follows that $n-m=3$, so $n=m+3$. Since $a<b$, we have $210^m<210^{m+3}$, so $m<m+3$, so $m<3$. Therefore, $m=0,1,2$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ possible values for $a$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
