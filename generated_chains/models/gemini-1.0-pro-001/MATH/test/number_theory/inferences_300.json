At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $n$ be the number of integers $m$ in the range $1\\le m\\le 8$ such that $\\text{gcd}(m,8)=1$. What is the remainder when $3^n$ is divided by $8$?",

Since $\\varphi(8)=4$, we have $3^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. Therefore, $3^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$. When $3^n$ is divided by $8$, the remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.
