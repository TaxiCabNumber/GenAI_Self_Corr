At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The extended Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, and it can also be used to find multiplicative inverses.\nThe extended Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the two numbers by their remainders, until the remainder is 1. The multiplicative inverse of the second number is then the last non-zero remainder in the sequence.\nIn this case, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 398 as follows:\n```\n398 = 7 * 56 + 4\n7 = 4 * 1 + 3\n4 = 3 * 1 + 1\n```\nSo the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 398 is 1.\nSince 1 is less than 398, this is the solution to the problem.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.
