At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive perfect cube factors does $3^65^{10}$ have?",

To count the number of perfect cube factors, we must count the factors of $3^6\\cdot5^{10}$ that have $a=0$, $3$, or $6$ and $b=0$, $3$, $6$, or $9$. This gives $3\\cdot4=\\boxed{12}$ perfect cube factors."
