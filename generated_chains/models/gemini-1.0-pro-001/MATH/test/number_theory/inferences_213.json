        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet x be the tens digit and y be the ones digit. Then the number is 10x + y. Since it is exactly twice the sum of its digits, we have:\n\n```\n10x + y = 2(x + y)\n```\n\nSimplifying:\n\n```\n8x = x + y\n7x = y\n```\n\nSince x and y are positive integers, the only possible solution is x = 1 and y = 7.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$17$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the tens digit of the two-digit integer be $a$ and let its units digit be $b$.  The equation \\[\n10a+b=2(a+b)\n\\] is given.  Distributing on the right-hand side and subtracting $2a+b$ from both sides gives $8a=b$.  Since $8a>9$ for any digit $a>1$, we have $a=1$, $b=8$, and $10a+b=\\boxed{18}$."
