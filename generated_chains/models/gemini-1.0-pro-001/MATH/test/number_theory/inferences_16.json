        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product (in base 10) of the first and last digits of the base-6 representation of $682_{10}$?",
        "inference": "First, we need to convert $682_{10}$ to base 6.\n$$682_{10}=6\\times 6^2+8\\times 6^1+2\\times 6^0=218_6$$\n\nThe first digit of $218_6$ is 2, and the last digit is 8. \nSo, the product of the first and last digits of the base-6 representation of $682_{10}$ is $2\\times 8=16$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by converting $682_{10}$ into base-6. We see that $6^3=216$ is the largest power of 6 that is less than 682, and that $3\\cdot216=648$ is the largest multiple of 216 that is less than 682. This leaves us with a remainder of $682-648=34$, which we can express as $5\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0$. So, $682_{10}=3\\cdot6^3+0\\cdot6^2+5\\cdot{6^1}+4\\cdot6^0=3054_6$. The first and last digits are 3 and 4, respectively, making the product of the two equal to $\\boxed{12}$."
