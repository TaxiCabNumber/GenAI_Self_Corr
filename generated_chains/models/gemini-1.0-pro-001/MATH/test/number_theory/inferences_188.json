At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne morning each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of family members.\n\nTotal amount of milk = 8x ounces\nTotal amount of coffee = 8x ounces\nAmount of milk Angela drank = 1/4 * (8x) = 2x ounces\nAmount of coffee Angela drank = 1/6 * (8x) = 4/3x ounces\n\nTherefore, Angela drank 2x ounces of milk and 4/3x ounces of coffee.\n\nSince Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk, we have:\n\n2x = 1/4 * (8x)\n=> 2x = 2x\n=> x = 1\n\nSince Angela drank a sixth of the total amount of coffee, we have:\n\n4/3x = 1/6 * (8x)\n=> 4/3x = 4/3x\n=> x = 1\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 person in the family.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=\\boxed{5}$."
