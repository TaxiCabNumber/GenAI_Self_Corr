At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number in base $10$, written as $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i \\cdot 3^i$. Then in base $2$, the number is $n = \\sum_{i=0}^\\ell b_i \\cdot 2^i$. We have $2^\\ell = 3^k$, so $k = \\frac{\\ell}{\\log_3 2} = \\frac{\\ell}{0.6309}$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $\\ell$ must be a multiple of $0.6309$. The smallest multiple of $0.6309$ greater than $0$ is $0.6309$, so $\\ell = 1$. Then $k = 0$, so $n = b_0$ in base $10$. Thus, the sum of all such numbers is simply the sum of all the powers of $2$ from $2^0$ to $2^1$, which is $2^0 + 2^1 = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $3$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we consider integers that have $2$ digits in base $2$ and $1$ digit in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $10_2 = 2$, but strictly less than $10_3 = 3$. The only such integer is $2$.\n\nNext we consider integers that have $4$ digits in base $2$ and $2$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $1000_2 = 2^3$, but strictly less than $100_3 = 3^2$. The only such integer is $8$.\n\nNext we consider integers that have $6$ digits in base $2$ and $3$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $100000_2 = 2^5$, but strictly less than $1000_3 = 3^3$. There are no such integers, because $2^5 > 3^3$.\n\nIf we continue in this fashion, we may come to suspect that there are no more solutions of any length. Let us prove this. If an integer $N$ has $2d$ digits in base $2$, then $N\\ge 2^{2d-1}$. But if $N$ has only $d$ digits in base $3$, then $N<3^d$. A mutual solution is possible only if $$2^{2d-1}<3^d.$$We can rearrange this inequality as $$\\left(\\frac 43\\right)^d < 2.$$By inspection, this inequality is valid for $d=1,2$ but invalid for $d=3$, and also invalid for any larger $d$ since the left side increases as $d$ increases. This shows that there are no solutions $N$ beyond those we found already: $2$ and $8$, whose sum is $\\boxed{10}$."
