At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit numbers are divisible by 13?",
        "inference": "To be divisible by 13, a number must be divisible by both 1 and 3. A number is divisible by 1, so we only need to check for divisibility by 3.\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\nThe sum of the digits of a three-digit number is between 3 and 27, inclusive.\nThe only numbers between 3 and 27 that are divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24.\nTherefore, there are 8 three-digit numbers that are divisible by 13.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$8$}.

        "ground_truth": "The smallest three-digit number divisible by 13 is $13\\times 8=104$, so there are seven two-digit multiples of 13. The greatest three-digit number divisible by 13 is $13\\times 76=988$. Therefore, there are $76-7=\\boxed{69}$ three-digit numbers divisible by 13.\n\n\\[ OR \\]Because the integer part of $\\frac{999}{13}$ is 76, there are 76 multiples of 13 less than or equal to 999. Because the integer part of $\\frac{99}{13}$ is 7, there are 7 multiples of 13 less than or equal to 99. That means there are $76-7=\\boxed{69}$ multiples of 13 between 100 and 999."
