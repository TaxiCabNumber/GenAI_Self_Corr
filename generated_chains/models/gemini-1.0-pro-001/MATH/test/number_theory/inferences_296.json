At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "$$80325 = 3^4 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$$\n\nTo divide $80325$, we need at least $4$ $3$'s, $2$ $5$'s, and $1$ $7$. These are provided by $3^4$, $5^2$, and $7$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ is just the sum of the exponents of $3$, $5$, and $7$.\n\n$$n = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$.

        "ground_truth": "We find the prime factorization of $80325$, which is $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 17$. The largest prime in the factorization is $17$, so $n$ is at least 17. Since there are three factors of $3$, two factors of $5$, and one factor of $7$ in the prime factorization of $17!$, the minimum value of $n$ is $\\boxed{17}$."
