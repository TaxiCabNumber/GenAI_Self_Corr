Substituting this into $2n+1$, we get\n\n$$2n+1=2(7k+3)+1=14k+6+1=14k+7.$$\n\nDividing this by 7, we get a remainder of $0$, so $2n+1$ is divisible by 7.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$0$}.

        "ground_truth": "If $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, then $n = 7k+3$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $2n+1 = 2(7k+3)+1 = 14k+6+1 = 14k+7 = 7(2k+1)$. Since $7(2k+1)$ is divisible by 7, the remainder when $2n+1$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{0}$."
