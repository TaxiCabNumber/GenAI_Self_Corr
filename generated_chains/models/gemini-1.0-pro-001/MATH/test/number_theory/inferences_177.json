At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84. What is the least possible sum of these integers?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the integers be x, y, and z. Then we have\n\n$$xyz = 84.$$\n\nSince x, y, and z are distinct, they must be factors of 84.\n\nThe factors of 84 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84.\n\nThe only way to get a product of 84 with three distinct factors is to use the factors 2, 3, and 14. So,\n\n$$x = 2, \\quad y = 3, \\quad z = 14.$$\n\nThe sum of these integers is\n\n$$x + y + z = 2 + 3 + 14 = 19.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{19}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the prime factors of the set of numbers must equal the prime factors of 84, which are $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot7$. The set with the smallest sum would be the factors themselves - 2, 2, 3, and 7. However, the set can't have two 2's since the integers must be distinct, but it can have a 4, 3, and 7 instead.  The sum of those numbers is $\\boxed{14}$.  We could also have paired one of the 2's with the 3, to have 2, 6, and 7, but these have sum 15.  Grouping the extra 2 with 7 gives 2, 3, and 14 (which sum to 19), and any other grouping clearly gives a sum higher than 14."
