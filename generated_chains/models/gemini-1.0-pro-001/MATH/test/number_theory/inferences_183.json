At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe two-digit number $``B6,''$ where $B$ is the tens digit, is the square of a positive integer. How many distinct possible values are there for $B$?",
        "inference": "If $B$ is the tens digit, then $6$ is the units digit and the number is $10B+6$. This number is the square of a positive integer, so we have \n$$10B+6=N^2$$\n\nfor some positive integer $N$. Rearranging, we get \n$$10B=N^2-6$$\n\nSince $N^2-6$ is even, $10B$ must also be even, so $B$ must be even. The only even digit that can be the tens digit is $4$, so \n$$10(4)=N^2-6$$\n\nSolving for $N$, we get \n$$N^2=46\\Rightarrow N=6$$\n\nTherefore, there is $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for $B$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the two-digit perfect squares, only $4^2=16$ and $6^2=36$ end in $6$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ distinct possible values for $B$."
