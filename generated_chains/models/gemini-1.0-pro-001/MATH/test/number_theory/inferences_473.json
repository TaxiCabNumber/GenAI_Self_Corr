        "inference": "First, we can list the divisors of $n$. Since $n > 1$, we have $1$ and $n$ as divisors. If $n$ is even, then $2$ and $n/2$ are also divisors. If $n$ is odd, then $n$ is not divisible by $2$. In this case, we can write $n = 2k + 1$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, the divisors of $n$ are $1$, $2k+1$, and the divisors of $k$.\n\nThe product of the divisors of $n$ is $1 \\times n \\times 2 \\times (n/2) = n^2$ if $n$ is even, and $1 \\times (2k+1) \\times \\text{divisors of }k = (2k+1) \\times \\text{divisors of }k$ if $n$ is odd.\n\nWe want the product of the divisors of $n$ to be $n^6$. If $n$ is even, then $n^2 = n^6$, which is only possible if $n = 2$. If $n$ is odd, then $(2k+1) \\times \\text{divisors of }k = n^6$. Since $2k+1$ is odd, the product of the divisors of $k$ must be $n^6$.

        "ground_truth": "Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot12=(1\\cdot12)(2\\cdot 6)(3\\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.\n\nRecall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.
