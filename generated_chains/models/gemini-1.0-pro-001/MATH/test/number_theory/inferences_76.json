At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSome positive integers have exactly four positive factors. For example, 35 has only 1, 5, 7 and 35 as its factors. What is the sum of the smallest five positive integers that each have exactly four positive factors?",
