At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $28n$ is divisible by $365$?",
        "inference": "Let $28n=365k$, where $n$ and $k$ are positive integers. \n\nThen $n=\\frac{365k}{28}=\\frac{5\\times73k}{4\\times7}=\\frac{5k}{4}$. \n\nSince $n$ is an integer, $k$ must be divisible by 4. \n\nThe smallest positive integer value of $k$ that is divisible by 4 is 4.\n\nTherefore, $n=\\frac{5k}{4}=\\frac{5\\times4}{4}=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $28=2^2\\cdot7$ and $365=5\\cdot73$, $(28,365)=1$. Therefore, $28n$ is divisible by 365 if and only if $n$ is divisible by both 5 and 73. Thus, the least value of $n$ is $5\\cdot73=\\boxed{365}$."
