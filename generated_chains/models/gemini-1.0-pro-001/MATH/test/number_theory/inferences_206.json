At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the arithmetic mean of all of the positive two-digit integers with the property that the integer is equal to the sum of its first digit plus its second digit plus the product of its two digits?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the tens digit and \\(y\\) be the units digit. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$10x + y = x + y + xy \\newline 9x = xy.$$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have either \\(x = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\). If \\(x = 0\\), then \\(y = 0\\), which is not a positive two-digit integer. Therefore, \\(y = 9\\). Substituting this into the first equation, we get \\(9x = 90\\), so \\(x = 10\\). Therefore, the only positive two-digit integer with the given property is \\(19\\).\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{19}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $AB$ be a two-digit integer with the property that $AB$ is equal to the sum of its first digit plus its second digit plus the product of its two digits. Thus we have $10A+B=A+B+AB\\Leftrightarrow9A=AB$. Now since $AB$ is a two-digit integer, $A\\ne0$, so we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $9=B$. Therefore, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, and 99 all have the property. Their arithmetic mean is $\\frac{\\frac{9(19+99)}{2}}{9}=\\frac{19+99}{2}=\\boxed{59}$."
