        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice is given the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, and $9.$ She must choose a pair of these digits, with the digits being different, to form a two-digit number. How many of the numbers she can construct will be divisible by $3$?",
        "inference": "There are $5$ options for the first digit. For the second digit, there are $4$ options because the two digits can't be the same. So there are $5\\times 4 = 20$ total possible two-digit numbers. To be divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$.\n\nThe sum of the digits of the numbers that can be made from $2, 3, 5, 7, 9$ are:\n\n* $2 + 3 = 5$\n* $2 + 5 = 7$\n* $2 + 7 = 9$\n* $2 + 9 = 11$\n* $3 + 5 = 8$\n* $3 + 7 = 10$\n* $3 + 9 = 12$\n* $5 + 7 = 12$\n* $5 + 9 = 14$\n* $7 + 9 = 16$\n\nOf these, only $5$ are divisible by $3$: $7, 9, 12, 15, 18$. So there are $5$ possible two-digit numbers divisible by $3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For a number to be divisible by $3$, its digits must add up to be a number divisible by $3$. We can easily find that three combinations work: $2+7=9$, $5+7=12$, and $3+9=12$. Since the unit and tens digits are interchangeable (the digits will still add up to a multiple of 3), there are $3 \\cdot 2 =\\boxed{6}$ possible numbers."
