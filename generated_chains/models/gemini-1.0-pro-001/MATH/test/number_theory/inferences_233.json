At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three consecutive integers is 720. What is the largest of these integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be \\(x\\), \\(x + 1\\), and \\(x + 2\\).

        "ground_truth": "Let the integers be $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$.  Their product is $n^3-n$.  Thus $n^3=720+n$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than $720$ is $729=9^3$, and indeed $729=720+9$.  So $n=9$ and the largest of the integers is $n+1=\\boxed{10}$."
