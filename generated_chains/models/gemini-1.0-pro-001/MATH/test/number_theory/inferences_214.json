        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S$ be the set of all integers $k$ such that, if $k$ is in $S$, then $\\frac{17k}{66}$ and $\\frac{13k}{105}$ are terminating decimals. What is the smallest integer in $S$ that is greater than 2010?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe fraction $\\frac{17k}{66}$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $k$ is divisible by $6$. The fraction $\\frac{13k}{105}$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $k$ is divisible by $15$. Thus, $k$ is in $S$ if and only if $k$ is divisible by $6$ and $15$. The smallest integer divisible by $6$ and $15$ is $30$, which is less than $2010$. The next integer divisible by both $6$ and $15$ is $60$, which is still less than $2010$. The next integer divisible by both $6$ and $15$ is $90$, which is greater than $2010$. Therefore, the smallest integer in $S$ that is greater than $2010$ is $\\boxed{90}.$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$90$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let us first analyze the fraction $\\frac{17k}{66}$. We can rewrite this fraction as $\\frac{17k}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11}$. Since the denominator can only contain powers of 2 and 5, we have that $k$ must be a multiple of 33. We now continue to analyze the fraction $\\frac{13k}{105}$. We rewrite this fraction as $\\frac{13k}{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7}$, and therefore deduce using similar logic that $k$ must be a multiple of 21. From here, we proceed to find the least common multiple of 21 and 33. Since $21 = 3 \\cdot 7$ and $33 = 3 \\cdot 11$, we conclude that the least common multiple of 21 and 33 is $3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = 231$.\n\nWe now know that $S$ contains exactly the multiples of 231. The smallest multiple of 231 that is greater than 2010 is $231 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{2079}$."
