At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the hundreds digit, \\(y\\) be the tens digit, and \\(z\\) be the units digit. Then we have:\n$$100x + 10y + z = N$$\n\nand $$xyz = 12.$$\n\nThe prime factorization of \\(12\\) is \\(12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3\\). So, the possible combinations of digits that give a product of $12$ are:\n$$2, 2, 3$$\n$$2, 3, 2$$\n$$3, 2, 2$$\n\nThe largest three-digit number that can be formed from these digits is \\(322\\).\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{322}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To get the largest number, first maximize the hundreds digit, then the tens, then the ones. One-digit factors of $12$ are $6$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $1$, so the hundreds digit must be $6$.  In order to make the digits multiply to 12, the next two digits must be $2$ and $1$.  Therefore, the largest three-digit number in which the product of the digits is $12$ is $\\boxed{621}$."
