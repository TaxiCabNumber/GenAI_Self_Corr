At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer, other than $1$, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIf $n$ is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, then we have $n=a^3=b^4$.  Therefore, $b^4=a^3$, which implies that $b^4$ is a perfect cube.  Since $4$ is not a perfect cube, $b$ cannot be an integer.  Therefore, $n$ cannot be a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{There is no positive integer other than $1$ that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.} I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is a perfect cube, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $3$. If $n$ is a perfect fourth power, then all exponents in its prime factorization are divisible by $4$. The only way both of these statements can be true is for all the exponents to be divisible by $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3,4]=12$, so such an $n$ must be a perfect twelfth power. Since we aren't using $1^{12}=1,$ the next smallest is $2^{12}=\\boxed{4096}.$"
