Therefore, to maximize the number of positive divisors, we need to find the integer less than 20 with the most prime factors. The prime factorizations of the positive integers less than 20 are:\n```\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7\n8 = 2^3\n9 = 3^2\n10 = 2 * 5\n11 = 11\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n13 = 13\n14 = 2 * 7\n15 = 3 * 5\n16 = 2^4\n17 = 17\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n19 = 19\n```\nThe integer with the most prime factors is 18, which has two prime factors, 2 and 3. Therefore, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is \n$$\\left(2+1\\right)\\left(2+1\\right)=\\boxed{9}.$$ I hope it is correct.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$",
        "ground_truth": "An integer $n$ in the form $p^e$, for some prime $p$ and positive integer $e$, has $(e+1)$ positive factors. To maximize $e$, let $p=2$, the smallest prime. Since $n$ is less than 20, $e$ is at most 4, which means $n$ can have 5 factors. If $n$ is in the form $p_1^{e_1}\\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then let $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$ to find the maximum possible $e_1$ and $e_2$. Both cannot be 2 (else $n=36$), so $e_1, e_2=1, 2$ give the most factors: $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors. Finally, $n$ cannot be divisible by any other prime since $2\\cdot3\\cdot5=30>20$. Thus, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6 factors. Of course, we could have solved this problem by finding the number of factors of each positive integer less than 20, but in general our approach is more efficient."
