At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence $30x \\equiv 42 \\pmod{47}$?",
        "inference": "Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $30^{-1} \\equiv 11 \\pmod{47}$. \n\nThus, multiplying both sides of the congruence by $11$, we have $x \\equiv 11 \\cdot 42 \\equiv 26 \\pmod{47}$. \n\nHence, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{26}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that 6 divides both $30x$ and $42$, and since 6 is relatively prime to 47, we can write $5x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{47}$. Note that $5 \\cdot 19 = 95 = 2(47) + 1$, so 19 is the modular inverse of 5, modulo 47. We multiply both sides of the given congruence by 19 to obtain $95x \\equiv 19(7) \\pmod{47}\\implies x \\equiv \\boxed{39} \\pmod{47}$."
