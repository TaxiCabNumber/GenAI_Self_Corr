At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA two-digit integer is divisible by $n$ and its last digit is $n$. What is the greatest possible value of $n$?",
        "inference": "Let the number be $10x+n$, where $x$ is the first digit. Since the number is divisible by $n$, $10x$ must be divisible by $n$, so $x$ must be divisible by $n$.\n\nSince $x$ is the first digit, $x \\leq 9$. Thus, $n \\leq 9$.\n\nThe greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are looking for the greatest possible value of the digit $n$, so let's see if $n=9$ is a possibility. 99 is divisible by 9, so the greatest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{9}$."
