At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of four consecutive positive even integers is a perfect square. What is the least possible sum?",
        "inference": "Let the four consecutive positive even integers be $2n, 2n+2, 2n+4, 2n+6$. \nTheir sum is\n$$2n+2n+2+2n+4+2n+6=8n+12 = 4(2n+3)$$. \nTherefore, $$2n+3$$ is a perfect square. The least possible perfect square greater than 3 is 4, so $$2n+3=4 \\Rightarrow n=\\frac{1}{2}$$. \nHowever, n must be an integer, so there is no solution. \n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-2$, $2n$, $2n+2$, and $2n+4$ be four consecutive positive even integers. If $(2n-2)+(2n)+(2n+2)+(2n+4)=8n+4=2^2(2n+1)=m^2$ for some positive integer $m$, then $2n+1$ must be an odd perfect square. $2n+1=1^2$ gives $n=0$, which we reject because our integers are positive. $2n+1=3^2$ gives $n=4$, which yields a sum of $8\\times4+4=36$. Thus, the least possible sum is $\\boxed{36}$."
