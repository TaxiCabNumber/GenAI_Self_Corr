At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many base-10 integers are exactly 4 digits in their base-3 representation and exactly 2 digits in their base-6 representation?",
        "inference": "Each digit in base-10 is less than 3.  Since the number is 4 digits in base-3, it is less than 3^4 = 81.  Since the same number is 2 digits in base-6, it is less than 6^2 = 36.  Thus, the number is less than 36.  \n\nThe smallest 4-digit base-3 number is 1000, which is 81 in decimal.  The smallest 2-digit base-6 number is 10, which is 6 in decimal.  So, the numbers we seek are between 6 and 81.  \n\nThere are 6 4-digit base-3 numbers between 6 and 36: 1000, 1001, 1002, 1010, 1011, and 1012.  There is only 1 such number between 36 and 81: 1100.  Thus, there are 7 such numbers in all.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Base-10 integers that are exactly 4 digits in base 3 range from $1000_3=3^3=27$ to less than $10000_3=3^4=81$. Base-10 integers that are exactly 2 digits in base 6 range from $10_6=6^1=6$ to less than $100_6=6^2=36$. So, for a number $n$ to satisfy the conditions, it must be that $27\\le n <36$. $n$ could be a number from 27 to 35, inclusive, which means there are $\\boxed{9}$ integers that meet the conditions of the problem."
