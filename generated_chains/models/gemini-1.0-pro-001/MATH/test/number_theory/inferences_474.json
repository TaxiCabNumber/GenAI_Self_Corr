At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWendy noticed when she stacked her quarters in piles of 5 she had 3 left over and when she stacked them in piles of 7 she had 5 left over. If she has less than ten dollars worth of quarters, how many quarters does she have?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** \nLet \\(x\\) be the number of quarters Wendy has. \n\n**Step 2:** \nWe know that \\(x\\) has a remainder of \\(3\\) when divided by \\(5\\). So, \\(x\\) can be expressed as $$x=5k+3$$ for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n**Step 3:** \nSimilarly, \\(x\\) has a remainder of \\(5\\) when divided by \\(7\\). So,  $$x=7l+5$$ for some integer \\(l\\).\n\n**Step 4:** \nEquating the two expressions for \\(x\\), we get  $$5k+3=7l+5$$ which simplifies to:  $$5k-7l=2$$\n\n**Step 5:** \nSince \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) are integers, the left-hand side of the equation must be even. Hence, \\(2\\) divides \\(5k-7l\\). \n\n**Step 6:** \nThe smallest positive integer that is divisible by \\(2\\) is \\(2\\). So,  $$5k-7l=2m$$ for some integer \\(m\\).  Substituting this into the equation from Step \\(3\\), we get  $$5k+3=7l+5$$ $$5k+3=7l+5$$ $$5k=7l+2$$\n\n**Step 7:** \nNow, we can solve for \\(k\\):  $$k=\\frac{7l+2}{5}$$ Since \\(k\\) is an integer, \\(7l+2\\) must be divisible by \\(5\\). The smallest positive integer that is divisible by \\(5\\) is \\(5\\). So,  $$7l+2=5n$$for some integer \\(n\\).  Substituting this into the expression for \\(k\\), we get  $$k=\\frac{5n}{5}=n$$\n\n**Step 8:** \nNow, we can substitute the expression for \\(k\\) back into the expression for \\(x\\):  $$x=5k+3=5n+3$$\n\n**Step 9:** \nSince \\(n\\) is an integer, the possible values of \\(x\\) are:  $$x=5\\cdot0+3=3$$ $$x=5\\cdot1+3=8$$\n\n**Step 10:** \nSince Wendy has less than ten dollars worth of quarters, she must have \\(8\\) quarters.\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{8}$$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the number of quarters. We know that \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 3\\pmod 5\\\\\na\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=3+5n$. Substituting this into $(b)$ gives \\[3+5n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\\ge 6\\implies a=3+5n\\ge 33$. $33$ happens to satisfy both congruences, so it is the smallest common solution. Since she has less than $10$ dollars worth of quarters, she has less than $40$ quarters. If $b$ is a common solution, subtracting $33$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-33\\equiv -30\\equiv 0\\pmod 5\\nonumber\\\\\nb-33\\equiv -28\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(5,7)=1$, we have $b-33\\equiv 0\\pmod{5\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 33\\pmod {35}$. The first couple of positive solutions of this are $33,68$. Thus, there exists only one positive solution less than $40$, which we found earlier to be $\\boxed{33}$."
