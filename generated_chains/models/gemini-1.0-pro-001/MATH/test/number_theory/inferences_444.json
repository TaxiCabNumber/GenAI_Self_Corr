At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the beginning of a program, the 105 members of a marching band stand in a rectangular formation named Formation $A$. All of the band members then move into Formation $B$, which is a different rectangular formation with six more rows, but with two fewer band members per row. How many rows are in Formation $A$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the number of rows in Formation $A$ be $r$.\n\nThe number of band members in Formation $A$ is $105 = r \\times$ (number of band members per row).\n\nThe number of rows in Formation $B$ is $r+6$.\n\nThe number of band members per row in Formation $B$ is $105/(r+6)-2$.\n\nThe total number of band members in Formation $B$ is $(r+6) \\times [105/(r+6)-2]$.\n\nSince the total number of band members is the same in both formations, we have:\n\n$$r \\times (\\text{number of band members per row}) = (r+6) \\times \\left[\\frac{105}{r+6}-2\\right]$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow r \\times (\\text{number of band members per row}) = (r+6) \\times \\frac{105-(r+6)\\times2}{r+6}$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow r \\times (\\text{number of band members per row}) = 105-2(r+6)$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow r \\times (\\text{number of band members per row}) = 105-2r-12$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow r \\times (\\text{number of band members per row}) = 93-2r$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\text{number of band members per row} = \\frac{93-2r}{r}$$\n\nSince the number of band members per row must be a positive integer, we have:\n\n$$93-2r \\geq 0$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 2r \\leq 93$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow r \\leq 46.5$$\n\nSince $r$ must be an integer, the greatest possible value of $r$ is $46$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$46$}.

        "ground_truth": "Let there be $x$ rows with $y$ band members per row in Formation $A$. Then we have $xy=105$. From the information about Formation $B$, we have $(x+6)(y-2)=105$. Multiplying and substituting $xy=105$, we get $xy-2x+6y-12=105-2x+6y-12=105\\Leftrightarrow -2x+6y=12\\Leftrightarrow x=3y-6$. We now substitute $3y-6$ for $x$ in $xy=105$ and use the quadratic formula to solve the resulting quadratic equation, $3y^2-6y-105=0$. The positive solution, $y=7$, gives $x=15$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{15}$ rows in Formation $A$."
