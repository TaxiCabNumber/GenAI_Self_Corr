        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 4?",
        "inference": "The last two digits of the Fibonacci sequence repeat in a period of 60. Therefore, the last two digits of the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term are the same as the last two digits of the $40^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term. The $40^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term is $102334155$, so the last two digits are $35$. Since $35$ divided by $4$ has a remainder of $3$, the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term is divided by $4$ is $3$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we look at the terms of the sequence mod 4, we see that they follow a pattern of period 6: \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{4},~\\ldots\n\\end{align*} Then we see that the terms repeat.  Therefore, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term is the same as the $4^{\\text{th}}$ term, and thus has a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 4."
