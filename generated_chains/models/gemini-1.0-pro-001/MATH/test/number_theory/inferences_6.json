I hope it is correct.'\nA bus comes by Jerry's bus stop every 20 minutes starting at exactly 5:13 a.m. If Jerry shows up at exactly 8:35 a.m., how many minutes will he have to wait for the next bus?",
        "inference": "Jerry arrived at 8:35 a.m., which is 192 minutes after 5:13 a.m. Since the bus comes every 20 minutes, we can divide 192 by 20 to find how many 20-minute intervals have passed. 192 \u00f7 20 = 9.6. Since Jerry missed the 8:33 a.m. bus, he will have to wait for the next bus, which will arrive 20 minutes later, at 8:53 a.m. Therefore, Jerry will have to wait for 8:53 a.m. - 8:35 a.m. = 18 minutes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 20 minutes evenly divides 60 minutes (which is an hour), the bus stops every 13 minutes, $13 + 20 = 33$ minutes, and $33 + 20 = 53$ minutes past the hour.  So after 8:35 AM, the next time that the bus stops is 8:53 AM, so Jerry must wait $53 - 35 = \\boxed{18}$ minutes."
