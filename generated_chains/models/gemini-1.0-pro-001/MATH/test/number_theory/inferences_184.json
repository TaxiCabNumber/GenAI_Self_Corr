At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many natural numbers less than 1000 have exactly three distinct positive integer divisors?",
        "inference": "First, we look at 6, as it is the smallest number with exactly 3 positive divisors: 1, 2, and 6 itself. To get the next smallest number with exactly 3 divisors, we must multiply 6 by the smallest prime number, 2, to get 12. Multiplying by 2 again gives us 24, which also has exactly 3 divisors: 1, 2, and 24. Continuing in this way, we can see that the numbers with exactly 3 divisors are of the form $6 \\times 2^n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, we need to find all the natural numbers less than 1000 that can be expressed in this form. We know that $6 \\times 2^n < 1000$ implies that $n < 9$. So, there are 9 possible values for $n$: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8.  \n\nTherefore, there are 9 natural numbers less than 1000 that have exactly three distinct positive integer divisors.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive divisors. Thus we must count the number of primes between 1 and $\\sqrt{1000}$ (the squares of these primes are all the natural numbers less than 1000 that have exactly three positive divisors). There are $\\boxed{11}$ such primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31."
