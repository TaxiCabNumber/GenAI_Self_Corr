At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $591{,}3d8$ is divisible by 12, what is the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$?",
        "inference": "**1.** 12 divides a number if and only if it divides both the sum of its digits and the alternating sum of its digits.\n**2.** The alternating sum of $5913d8$ is $\\\\~\\\\$\n$5-9+1-3+d-8=d-15.$\n**3.** Thus, 12 divides $d-15$. Since 12 is the largest common factor of 12 and $d-15$, we know that $d-15$ is divisible by 12.\n**4.** The only possibility for this is $d-15=0$, so $d=15.$\n**5.** The sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is therefore $1+5=\\boxed{6}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
