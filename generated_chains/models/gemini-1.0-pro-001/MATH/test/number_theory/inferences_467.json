        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYour friend has an egg collection comprising at least $200$ eggs. He wants to store them in dozen-egg containers. After filling as many containers as possible, the last container had $1$ egg left over. He then decided to store his eggs in customized baker-dozen-egg containers, where each container can hold $13$ eggs. It turns out that, after filling as many of these containers as possible, he still has $1$ egg left over. What is the minimum number of eggs that your friend could have?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $n$ be the number of eggs. Since the last container after filling dozen-egg containers had $1$ egg left over, $n$ must be of the form $12k+1$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Therefore, $n=12k+1$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nSince the last container after filling baker-dozen-egg containers also had $1$ egg left over, $n$ must also be of the form $13m+1$, where $m$ is a positive integer. Therefore, $n=13m+1$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nSince both $12k+1$ and $13m+1$ are equal to $n$, we have $12k+1=13m+1$. Subtracting $1$ from both sides, we get $12k=13m$. Dividing both sides by $13$, we get $k=m$.\n\nTherefore, $n=12k+1$ and $n=13m+1$, where $k=m$. Substituting $m=k$ into the second equation, we get $n=13k+1$.\n\nSince $k$ must be a positive integer and $n$ is at least $200$, we have $13k\\ge199$. Dividing both sides by $13$, we get $k\\ge15$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $k$ is $15$.\n\nSubstituting $k=15$ into the equation $n=13k+1$, we get $n=13\\cdot15+1=\\boxed{200}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{200}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We want the smallest integer $x$ such that $x \\ge 200$ and $x$ gives a remainder of $1$ when divided by both $12$ and $13$. We can write $x = 12 \\cdot 13n + 1 = 156n+1$, so now we need to find a sufficiently large value of $n$ such that $x \\ge 200$. If $n = 1$, $x = 157$, but when $n = 2$, $x = 313$. Therefore, your friend has $\\boxed{313}$ eggs."
