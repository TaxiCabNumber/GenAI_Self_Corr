Since the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $1575$, we have $21x^2 = 1575$, so $x^2 = 75$ and $x = 5$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$ is $5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:7$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=7k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 7 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[A,B]\\cdot\\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $1575k=(3k)(7k),$ which implies $k=1575/21=\\boxed{75}$."
