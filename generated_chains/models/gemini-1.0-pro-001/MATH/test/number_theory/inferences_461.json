        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nA multiple of 72 is of the form $72k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nThe number of positive factors of $72k$ is equal to the number of positive divisors of $72k$.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is $72=2^3\\cdot3^2$.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive factors of $72k$ is $(3+1)(2+1)=4\\cdot3=12$.\n\nTo have exactly 16 positive factors, we need to multiply $72k$ by a number that has 4 positive factors.\n\nThe only number with 4 positive factors is $2^2=4$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive multiple of 72 that has exactly 16 positive factors is $72k\\cdot4=288k$.\n\nThe least positive integer $k$ such that $288k$ has 16 positive factors is $k=1$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive multiple of 72 that has exactly 16 positive factors is $288\\cdot1=\\boxed{288}.$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{288}.$ I hope it is correct.**",

Multiplying by any higher power of 2 gives a product with more than 16 positive factors.\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives $2^3\\cdot 3^3$, which has $(3+1)(3+1) = 16$ positive factors.\n\nMultiplying by any prime $p$ gives $2^3 \\cdot 3^2\\cdot p$, which has $(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 24$ factors.\n\nSimilarly, multiplying by any other positive integer besides those we've considered produces a product that has more than 16 factors.
