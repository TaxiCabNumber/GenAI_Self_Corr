At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJax bought exactly enough trees to plant eight equal rows. Then one tree died and couldn't be planted, but he still had enough trees left to plant exactly nine equal rows. After that, a tree was stolen, but he still had enough trees left to plant exactly ten equal rows. If he bought the least number of trees satisfying these three conditions, how many trees did he buy?",
        "inference": "Let the number of trees that Jax bought be \\(x\\). Since he could plant 8 equal rows, he could plant 8 * \\(\\frac{x}{8}\\) trees in each row. After one tree was stolen, he could still plant 9 equal rows, so he could plant 9 * \\(\\frac{x - 1}{9}\\) trees in each row. After another tree was stolen, he could still plant 10 equal rows, so he could plant 10 * \\(\\frac{x - 2}{10}\\) trees in each row. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:\n\n$$9 * \\(\\frac{x - 1}{9}\\) = 10 * \\(\\frac{x - 2}{10}\\)$$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$$9(x - 1) = 10(x - 2)$$\n\n$$9x - 9 = 10x - 20$$\n\n$$-x = -11$$\n\n$$x = 11$$\n\nTherefore, Jax bought **11** trees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{11}.
