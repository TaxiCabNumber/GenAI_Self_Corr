At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the value of the base $b$ such that the following addition problem is correct: $$ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 6 & 6 & 5 & 1_b \\\\ + & & & 1 & 1 & 5_b \\\\ \\cline{1-6} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 6_b\\\\ \\end{array} $$",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe rightmost column adds to $6$, which is $6_{10}$, so $1_b+5_b=6_{10}$. The next column adds to $11$, which is $11_{10}$, so $6_b+1_b+1=11_{10}$. The third column adds to $10$, which is $10_{10}$, so $5_b+1+0=10_{10}$. \n\nWe can solve each of these equations to find the value of $b$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $1_b+5_b=6_{10}$. Since $5_b=5b$, we have $1_b+5b=6_{10}$. Since $1_b=1$, we have $1+5b=6_{10}$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $5b=5_{10}$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $b=1_{10}$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $6_b+1_b+1=11_{10}$. Since $6_b=6b$ and $1_b=1$, we have $6b+1+1=11_{10}$. Combining like terms, we get $6b+2=11_{10}$. Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get $6b=9_{10}$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $b=1\\frac{1}{2}_{10}$.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have $5_b+1+0=10_{10}$. Since $5_b=5b$, we have $5b+1+0=10_{10}$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $5b=9_{10}$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $b=1\\frac{4}{5}_{10}$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ that makes the addition problem correct is $b=1\\frac{1}{2}_{10}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1\\frac{1}{2}_{10}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
