At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $m$ and $n$ be positive integers such that $m = 24n + 51$. What is the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor of $2m$ and $3n$?",
        "inference": "Since $m = 24n + 51$, we can write $2m = 48n + 102 = 2(24n + 51) = 2m$.  Thus, any prime factor of $2m$ is also a prime factor of $3n$.  On the other hand, any prime factor of $3n$ is not a prime factor of $2m$.  Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $2m$ and $3n$ is $1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(2m, 3n) &= \\text{gcd}(2m-3n\\cdot16, 3n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(2\\cdot(24n+51)-48n, 3n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(102, 3n) \\\\\n&\\leq 102.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\text{gcd}(2m, 3n)$ is $\\boxed{102}$. For example, this is possible when $n=34 \\Rightarrow m=867$, as $3n=102$ and $2m=1734=102\\cdot17$."
