        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the units digit of $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + \\ldots + 50!$.",
        "inference": "The final digit of $n!$ for any integer $n$ is determined by the highest power of $10$ that divides $n!$. A number $n$ is divisible by $10$ if and only if its prime factorization contains at least one factor of $5$. The prime factorization of $n!$ contains a factor of $5$ for each multiple of $5$ less than or equal to $n$. For example, $20!$ contains factors of $5$ from $5, 10, 15$, and $20$, giving a total of $4$ factors of $5$.\n\nThe highest power of $10$ that divides $n!$ is $10^k$, where $k$ is the number of factors of $5$ in $n!$. Since $50!$ contains $12$ factors of $5$, the highest power of $10$ that divides $50!$ is $10^{12}$. Therefore, the final digit of $50!$ is the same as the final digit of $10^{12}$, which is $0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For $n\\ge5$, $n!$ includes the product $2\\times5=10$, which means the units digit of $n!$ is 0 (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0). Therefore, it only remains to find the units digit of $1!+2!+3!+4!$, which is the units digit of $1+2+6+4=13$. Thus, the units digit of $1!+2!+\\ldots+50!$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
