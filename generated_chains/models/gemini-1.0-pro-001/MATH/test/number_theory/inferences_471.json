At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen the base 10 integer 269 is converted to base 5, what is the sum of the digits?",
        "inference": "Convert 269 to base 5:\n\n269 / 5 = 53 R 4\n53 / 5 = 10 R 3\n10 / 5 = 2 R 0\n\n269 in base 5 = 2034\n\nSum of the digits = 2 + 0 + 3 + 4 = 9\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$9$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The largest power of 5 less than 269 is $5^3=125$. The largest multiple of 125 less than 269 is $2\\cdot125=250$. So the digit in the place for $5^3$ is 2. After subtracting 250 from 269, we have $269-250=19$. We can express 19 as $3\\cdot5^1+4\\cdot5^0$. That means we have a 3 in the place for $5^1$ and a 4 in the place for $5^0$. The base-5 representation of 269 is $2034_5$, so the sum of the digits is $2+0+3+4=\\boxed{9}$."
