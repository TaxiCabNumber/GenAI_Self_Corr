        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Chinese emperor orders a regiment of soldiers in his palace to divide into groups of $4$. They do so successfully. He then orders them to divide into groups of $3$, upon which $2$ of them are left without a group. He then orders them to divide into groups of $11$, upon which $5$ are left without a group. If the emperor estimates there are about two hundred soldiers in the regiment, what is the most likely number of soldiers in the regiment?",
        "inference": "Let the number of soldiers be x.\nFor groups of 4, x is divisible by 4, so x = 4k  for some integer k.\nFor groups of 3, 2 are left out, so x = 3m + 2  for some integer m.\nFor groups of 11, 5 are left out, so x = 11n + 5  for some integer n.\n\nThus, 4k = 3m + 2 and 4k = 11n + 5.\n\n4k - 2 = 3m, so 4(k - 1) = 3m.  k - 1 must be divisible by 3, hence k must be 4 or 7 or 10 etc.\n\n4k - 5 = 11n, so 4(k - 1) - 1 = 11n.  k - 1 must be divisible by 11, hence k must be 12 or 23 or 34 etc.\n\nSince k must be divisible by both 3 and 11, k must be 33 or 66 or 99 etc.  The smallest one which gives x = 4k less than or equal to 200 is k = 33, which gives x = 4 * 33 = 132.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{132}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of soldiers. According to the problem statement, it follows that \\begin{align*}\nn &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\\\\nn &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}\n\\end{align*}By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is an unique residue that $n$ can leave, modulo $33$; since $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, it follows that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{33}$. Also, we know that $n$ is divisible by $4$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again, it follows that $n \\equiv 104 \\pmod{132}$. Writing out the first few positive values of $n$, we obtain that $n = 104, 236, 368$, and so forth. The closest value of $n$ is $\\boxed{236}$."
