        "inference": "We have $r^2 + 4r + 4 \\equiv r^2 + 2r + 1 \\pmod{55}$ if and only if $2r + 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{55}$, which is equivalent to $2r \\equiv 52 \\pmod{55}$. Since $\\gcd(2, 55) = 1$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers $s$ and $t$ such that $2s + 55t = 1$. Multiplying both sides by $52$, we get $2 \\cdot 52s + 55 \\cdot 52t = 52$. Since $55 \\cdot 52 = 2860$, we have $2 \\cdot 52s + 2860t = 52$. Therefore, $52s \\equiv 52 \\pmod{55}$, so $s \\equiv 1 \\pmod{55}$. Thus, $r \\equiv 52s \\equiv 52 \\equiv \\boxed{27} \\pmod{55}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{27}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Add $-r^2-2r-4$ to both sides of the given congruence to obtain $2r\\equiv -3\\pmod{55}$. We can multiply both sides by $28$ to get $56r \\equiv -3\\cdot 28\\pmod{55}$. Subtracting $55r$ from the left-hand side and adding $2\\cdot 55=110$ to the right-hand side gives $r\\equiv 26\\pmod{55}$. Thus $r=26+55k$ for some integer $k$. Solving $26+55k\\geq 1000$, we find that $k=18$ is the smallest value of $k$ for which $r$ has four digits. Thus the minimum four-digit value of $r$ is $26+55(18)=\\boxed{1016}$."
