At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of the year on the planet Mars is exactly 697 days. If Mars has a calendar with a 12-day week, and year 0 begins on the first day of the week, what is the next year which will begin on the first day of the week?",
        "inference": "Every 12-day week accounts for 12 days.\nTo find the number of weeks, we divide the number of days in a year by the number of days in a week.\nNumber of weeks = 697 days / 12 days/week = 58.08 weeks.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a week, we round up to the nearest whole number of weeks, which is 59 weeks.\nTo find the number of days in 59 weeks, we multiply the number of weeks by the number of days in a week.\nNumber of days = 59 weeks * 12 days/week = 708 days.\nTo find the number of years, we divide the number of days by the number of days in a year.\nNumber of years = 708 days / 697 days/year = 1.02 years.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number of years, which is 2 years.\nTherefore, the next year which will begin on the first day of the week is year 2.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $697 = 12 \\cdot 58 + 1$, each Martian year consists of 58 weeks and a day.  Therefore, for every year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  Since year 0 begins on the first day, year 1 begins on the second day, then year 2 begins on the third day, and so on.  A week consists of 12 days, so the next year that begins on the first day again will be year $\\boxed{12}$."
