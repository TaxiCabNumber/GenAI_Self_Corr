At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Since $5<\\frac nk<6$, we have $5n<k<6n$. We can write $k=5n+r$, where $0<r<n$. The least common multiple of $n$ and $k$ is $n\\cdot\\frac{k}{gcd(n,k)}$, and the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $k$ is $gcd(n,k)$. Therefore, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\\gcd(n,k)}=\\frac{n\\cdot\\frac{k}{gcd(n,k)}}{gcd(n,k)}=\\frac{k}{gcd(n,k)}=\\frac{5n+r}{gcd(n,k)}$$\n\nSince $gcd(n,k)\\mid n$, we have $gcd(n,k)\\mid 5n$. Similarly, since $gcd(n,k)\\mid k$, we have $gcd(n,k)\\mid r$. Therefore, $gcd(n,k)$ is a common divisor of $5n$ and $r$. Since $0<r<n$, the greatest common divisor of $5n$ and $r$ is $r$. Therefore, $gcd(n,k)=r$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\\gcd(n,k)}=\\frac{5n+r}{r}=\\frac{5n+r}{r}=5+\\frac{r}{n}$$\n\nSince $0<r<n$, we have $\\frac{r}{n}<1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\\gcd(n,k)}$ is $5+1=\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",

Then $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k] = \\frac{n\\cdot k}{\\gcd(n,k)} = n'\\cdot k'\\cdot\\gcd(n,k)$, so $$\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\\gcd(n,k)} = n'k'.$$We have $\\frac{n'}{k'} = \\frac nk$.

Clearly the denominator $k'$ is at least $2$, and the numerator $n'$ is at least $5(2)+1=11$, so the smallest possible value for $n'k'$ is $(11)(2)=\\boxed{22}$.\n\nNote that this result, $\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\\gcd(n,k)}=22$, can be achieved by the example $n=11,k=2$."
