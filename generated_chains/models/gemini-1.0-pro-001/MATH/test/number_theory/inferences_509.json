At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first 2007 positive integers are each written in base 3.  How many of these base-3 representations are palindromes?  (A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.)",
        "inference": "When written in base 3, every number 0 \u2264 n < 3^k has at most k digits.  Certainly any number n < 3^1 is a palindrome.\n\nSuppose that the last digit of n is 0.  Then n is of the form 3m, where m < 3^k-1.  The first digit of 3m = 0...0m (k 0's) is 0, so 3m is a palindrome.\n\nSuppose that the last digit of n is 1.  Then n is of the form 3m+1, where m < 3^k-1.  The first digit of 3m+1 = 0...0(m+1) (k-1 0's) is 1, so 3m+1 is not a palindrome.\n\nSuppose that the last digit of n is 2.  Then n is of the form 3m+2, where m < 3^k-1.  The first digit of 3m+2 = 0...0(m+1) (k-1 0's) is 1, so 3m+2 is not a palindrome.\n\nHence among the 2007 positive integers written in base 3, there are 2007 - (3^7 - 1) = 2007 - 2186 = 2007 - 2187 = -180 palindromes.  Since the number of palindromes must be a nonnegative integer, the only solution is:\n```\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.\n```",
        "ground_truth": "Because $3^6=729<2007<2187=3^7$, it is convenient to begin by counting the number of base-3 palindromes with at most 7 digits. There are two palindromes of length 1, namely 1 and 2.  There are also two palindromes of length 2, namely 11 and 22.  For $n\\geq 1$, each palindrome of length $2n+1$ is obtained by inserting one of the digits $0$, $1$,  or $2$ immediately after the $n\\text{th}$ digit in a palindrome of length $2n$.  Each palindrome of length $2n+2$ is obtained by similarly inserting one of the strings $00$, $11$,  or $22$.  Therefore there are 6 palindromes of each of the lengths 3 and 4, 18 of each of the lengths 5 and 6, and 54 of length 7. Because the base-3 representation of 2007 is 2202100, that integer is less than each of the palindromes 2210122, 2211122, 2212122, 2220222, 2221222, and 2222222.  Thus the required total is $2+2+6+6+18+18+54-6=\\boxed{100}$."
