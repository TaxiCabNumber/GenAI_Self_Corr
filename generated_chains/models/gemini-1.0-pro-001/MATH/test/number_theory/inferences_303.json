At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat positive five-digit whole number with an 8 in the ten-thousands place is a perfect cube?",
        "inference": "The only possible five-digit whole number with an 8 in the ten-thousands place is 80,000. To find out if it is a perfect cube, we need to find its cube root.\n\nThe cube root of 80,000 is 40. Therefore, 80,000 is a perfect cube.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{80000}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m^3$ be a positive five-digit perfect cube with an 8 in the ten-thousands place. Thus, $8\\times10^4<m^3<9\\times10^4\\Longleftrightarrow 20\\sqrt[3]{10}<m<10\\sqrt[3]{90}\\Rightarrow43<m<45$. Therefore we conclude $m=44$, so $m^3=44^3=\\boxed{85,\\!184}$."
