At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two positive whole numbers is 2005. If neither number is 1, what is the sum of the two numbers?",
        "inference": "Let's call the two numbers $a$ and $b$. We know that $a \\times b = 2005$. Since neither number is 1, we can write $a = p \\times q$ and $b = r \\times s$, where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are all prime numbers.\n\nThen, $a \\times b = p \\times q \\times r \\times s = 2005$. Since 2005 is a prime number, we know that $p \\times q = 2005$. The only way to write 2005 as a product of two prime numbers is $2005 = 5 \\times 401$. Therefore, $a = 5 \\times 401$.\n\nSince $a$ is a positive whole number, we know that $q = 401$. Therefore, $b = 2005 / (5 \\times 401) = 2005 / 2005 = 1$. This is a contradiction, since we know that neither number is 1.\n\nTherefore, there are no two positive whole numbers that multiply to 2005 and that are both not equal to 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{no such numbers exist}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$2005=5\\cdot401$. Checking the primes less than $\\sqrt{401}$ as potential divisors, we see that 401 is prime. Thus, the positive whole numbers in question are 5 and 401. Their sum is $\\boxed{406}.$"
