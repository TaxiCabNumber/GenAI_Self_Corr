At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe greatest common divisor of two positive integers less than $100$ is equal to $3$. Their least common multiple is twelve times one of the integers. What is the largest possible sum of the two integers?",
        "inference": "Since the greatest common divisor of the integers is $3$, the integers are $3a$ and $3b$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime and at least $3$.\n\nThe least common multiple of the integers is $3ab$, which is twelve times one of the integers. Therefore, $3ab=12(3a) \\Rightarrow b=4$.\n\nThe largest possible sum of the two integers is $3a+3(4)$, which is $3a+12$. Since $a$ is at least $3$, the largest possible value of $3a+12$ is $3(4)+12 = \\boxed{24}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",

Using the identity that $ab = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] \\cdot \\gcd(a,b)$, it follows that $ab = 36a$, and so $b = 36$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$, we know $a$ is divisible by 3.  However, $a$ cannot be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, because if $a$ was divisible by 9, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 9 as well, since 36 is divisible by 9.  This cannot occur since $\\gcd(a,b) = 3$.  Similarly, $a$ cannot be divisible by 2, because if $a$ were divisible by 2, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 2 as well, since 36 is divisible by 2.\n\nIn summary, $a$ is a multiple of 3, but not 9, and $a$ is not divisible by 2.
