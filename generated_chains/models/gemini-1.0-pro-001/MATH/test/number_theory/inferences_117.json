        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe given number can be divisible by 66 if the three-digit number is a multiple of 33 and the one-digit number is a multiple of 2. \n\nFor a three-digit number to be a multiple of 33, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. This means that $4+a+5+b+3+2$ must be a multiple of 3. \n\nSimplifying, we get $a+b+14$ must be a multiple of 3. \n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are digits, $a+b$ must be between 0 and 18. The only values of $a+b$ between 0 and 18 that are multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.\n\nTherefore, $a+b = \\boxed{15}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $66$, it must be divisible by $2$, $3$ and $11$. Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $11$, we know $4-a+5-b+3-2$ is a multiple of $11$, so $11\\mid 10-a-b$. So either $10-a-b=-11$, $10-a-b=0$, $10-a-b=11$, etc., which gives $a+b=21$, $a+b=10$, or $a+b=-1$. The only value which works is $a+b=10$, since $a$ and $b$ are digits. There are several pairs $(a,b)$ which fit this condition, but it doesn't matter which one we choose since in all cases, the quantity we want is $a+b=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nJust to be safe, we check that if $a+b=10$, the number is also divisible by $2$ and $3$. No matter what $a$ and $b$ are, $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $2$ since the units digit is even. The sum of the digits is $4+a+5+b+3+2=14+a+b=14+(10)=24$, which is divisible by $3$ so $4a5,b32$ is divisible by three. Thus our solution works."
