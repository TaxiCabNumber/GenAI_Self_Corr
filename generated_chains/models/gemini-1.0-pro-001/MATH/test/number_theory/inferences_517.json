At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are two cameras that take pictures of a traffic intersection. Camera A starts taking pictures at $6$ AM and takes a picture every $11$ minutes. Camera B starts taking pictures at $7$ AM and takes pictures every $7$ minutes. Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at four different times before noon. When Camera A and Camera B take their last picture together, how many minutes before noon is it?",
        "inference": "Camera A takes a picture at times $x = 6 + 11k$ minutes after 6 AM, where $k = 0, 1, 2, ...$ Camera B takes a picture at times $y = 7 + 7j$ minutes after 7 AM, where $j = 0, 1, 2, ...$ To find when they take a picture at the same time, we solve the equation $6 + 11k = 7 + 7j$ for integers $k$ and $j$. \n$$11k - 7j = 1$$ This can be solved using the extended Euclidean algorithm, which gives $k = 1$ and $j = 2$, so Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time at $6 + 11 = 17$ minutes and $7 + 7 \\cdot 2 = 21$ minutes after 6 AM.\n\nThe next time they take a picture at the same time is $11$ minutes later, at $t = 17 + 11 = 28$ and $t = 21 + 11 = 32$ minutes after 6 AM. \n\nThe next time they take a picture at the same time is $11$ minutes later, at $t = 39$ and $t = 43$ minutes after 6 AM.\n$$t = 39, 43$$\n\nThe next time they take a picture at the same time is $11$ minutes later, at $t = 50$ and $t = 54$ minutes after 6 AM. \n\n$$t = 50, 54$$\n\nSince noon is $360$ minutes after 6 AM, the last time Camera A and Camera B take a picture together is $\\boxed{306}$ minutes before noon.\n$$Final Answer: \\boxed{306}. I hope it is correct.$$",
        "ground_truth": "If Camera A and Camera B take a picture at the same time, they will take a picture $77$ minutes later at the same time. Therefore, if we can find the first time they take a picture together, then we can continue adding $77$ minutes to figure out when the fourth picture was taken. Camera A's first pictures after $7$ AM is at $7:06$, followed by $7:17$ and $7:28$. Camera B will take a picture at $7:28$. From here, we add $77$ minutes until we have taken four pictures. $7:28$ is followed by $8:45$, which is followed by $10:02$, which is followed by $11:19$. This is $\\boxed{41}$ minutes before noon."
