At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of integers 240 and $k$ is a perfect cube.

        "inference": "The prime factorization of 240 is 2^4 * 3 * 5. Since the product of integers 240 and $k$ is a perfect cube, all the primes in the prime factorization of 240 must appear an even number of times in the prime factorization of $k$. Therefore, the smallest possible positive value of $k$ is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 4 * 9 * 25 = 900.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$900$}. I hope it is correct.",
