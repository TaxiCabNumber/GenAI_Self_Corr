At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive factors of 4000 are multiples of 100?",
        "inference": "- First, find all the factors of 4000. The prime factorization of 4000 is \\(\\text{2}^5 \\cdot \\text{5}^3\\)\n\n- All the factors of 4000 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, and 4000. \n\n- Now, find the multiples of 100 among 4000's factors that are multiples of 100: 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 2000, and 4000. \n\n- Thus, there are \\boxed{8} positive factors of 4000 that are multiples of 100.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}.
