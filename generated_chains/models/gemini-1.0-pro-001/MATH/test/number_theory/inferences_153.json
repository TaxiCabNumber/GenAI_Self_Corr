At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip. If their teacher puts them in groups of 8, the last group has 5 students. If their teacher instead puts them in groups of 6, the last group has 3 students. What is the sum of all possible values of $N$?",
        "inference": "If the last group has 5 students, then $N = 8k + 5$ for some integer $k$. If the last group has 3 students, then $N = 6m + 3$ for some integer $m$. Since $N$ is the same in both cases, we can set these equal and solve for $k$ and $m$:\n\n$$8k + 5 = 6m + 3$$\n\n$$2k = m - 2$$\n\n$$k = \\frac{m - 2}{2}$$\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, $m$ must be even. The smallest even value of $m$ that makes $k$ an integer is $m = 4$, which gives $k = 1$. This gives $N = 8k + 5 = 8(1) + 5 = 13$. The next even value of $m$ that makes $k$ an integer is $m = 6$, which gives $k = 2$. This gives $N = 8k + 5 = 8(2) + 5 = 21$. The only other even value of $m$ that makes $k$ an integer is $m = 8$, which gives $k = 3$. This gives $N = 8k + 5 = 8(3) + 5 = 29$. The sum of all possible values of $N$ is $13 + 21 + 29 = \\boxed{63}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{63}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We are given that $N\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $N\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $x\\equiv 3\\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\\boxed{66}$."
