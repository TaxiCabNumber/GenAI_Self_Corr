At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEmma plays with her square unit tiles by arranging all of them into different shaped rectangular figures. (For example, a $5$ by $7$ rectangle would use $35$ tiles and would be considered the same rectangle as a $7$ by $5$ rectangle). Emma can form exactly ten different such rectangular figures that each use all of her tiles. What is the least number of tiles Emma could have?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let $x$ be the least number of tiles Emma could have. We know that $x$ can be expressed as the product of two factors, $a$ and $b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle.\n\n**Step 2:** Since Emma can form exactly ten different rectangular figures, we know that $x$ has ten different factor pairs.\n\n**Step 3:** We can list the first few factor pairs of $x$: $(1, x), (2, x/2), (3, x/3), ...$\n\n**Step 4:** We can see that the least number of tiles Emma could have is when the two factors are closest together. This occurs when $a = 2$ and $b = x/2$, or when $a = 3$ and $b = x/3$.\n\n**Step 5:** Substituting these values into the expression for $x$, we get $x = 2 \\cdot (x/2) = x$ and $x = 3 \\cdot (x/3) = x$.\n\n**Step 6:** Therefore, $x$ must be a multiple of both $2$ and $3$.\n\n**Step 7:** The smallest number that is a multiple of both $2$ and $3$ is $6$. Therefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.\n\nIf the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is\n\\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\dotsm (e_n + 1).\\]Note that $e_i \\ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.\n\nIf $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$\n\nOtherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.
