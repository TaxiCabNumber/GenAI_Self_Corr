At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlexa has a mixture consisting of 8 ounces of red jelly beans and 13 ounces of green jelly beans. What is the minimum number of ounces of white jelly beans she must buy so that, when added to the old mixture, her new mixture is an integer number of pounds?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the weights from ounces to pounds.\n\n8 ounces = 8 / 16 = 0.5 pounds\n13 ounces = 13 / 16 = 0.8125 pounds\n\n**Step 2:** Find the total weight of the current mixture.\n\nTotal weight = 0.5 pounds + 0.8125 pounds = 1.3125 pounds\n\n**Step 3:** Determine how many pounds the new mixture should weigh.\n\nSince we want the total weight to be an integer number of pounds, the minimum number of pounds it can weigh is 2 pounds.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the additional weight needed.\n\nAdditional weight = 2 pounds - 1.3125 pounds = 0.6875 pounds\n\n**Step 5:** Convert the additional weight from pounds to ounces.\n\nAdditional weight = 0.6875 pounds * 16 = 11 ounces\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$11$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since 8+13=21 ounces and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the minimum number of ounces Alexa must add to have an integer number of pounds is $2\\cdot16-21=32-21=\\boxed{11}$."
