        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many increasing sequences of three distinct prime numbers have a sum of 20?",
        "inference": "We begin by listing all the primes less than 20: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.\n\nThe only sequence whose sum is less than 20 is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.\n\nThe only increasing sequences of three distinct prime numbers whose sum is 20 is 5 + 7 + 8 = 20.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "List the primes up to 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) and note that the largest possible prime in the sum is 13 because no two primes add up to $20-17=3$ and of course 19 is too large as well. Also, observe that 2, the only even prime, must be in the sum, because the sum of three odd primes can never be 20. Starting with 2 and 3, we see that $20-(2+3)=15$ is not prime. Next, 2 and 5 give $20-(2+5)=13$, a prime, so one such increasing sequence is 2, 5, 13. Next, we take 2 and 7, and we see that $20-(2+7)=11$ is prime as well, giving us the second sequence 2, 7, 11. 11 and 13 are already included, so we are done. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ increasing sequences of three distinct prime numbers that have a sum of 20."
