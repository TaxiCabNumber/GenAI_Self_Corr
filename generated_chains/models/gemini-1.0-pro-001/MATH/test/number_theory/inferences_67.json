What is $a+b+c$?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, where $p_1,p_2,\\cdots,p_r$ are distinct primes and $k_1,k_2,\\cdots,k_r$ are positive integers. The number of positive divisors of $n$ is $(k_1+1)(k_2+1)\\cdots(k_r+1)$, which can be written as $x$ in the given expression. The product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ is $p_1^{k_1-1}p_2^{k_2-1}\\cdots p_r^{k_r-1}$, which can be written as $n^{(ax+b)/c}$ in the given expression. Therefore, we have\n\n$$p_1^{k_1-1}p_2^{k_2-1}\\cdots p_r^{k_r-1}=n^{(ax+b)/c}.$$\n\nTaking logarithms on both sides, we get\n\n$$(k_1-1)\\log p_1+(k_2-1)\\log p_2+\\cdots+(k_r-1)\\log p_r=\\frac{ax+b}{c}\\log n.$$\n\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are relatively prime, we must have $c|(k_i-1)$ for each $i=1,2,\\cdots,r$. Therefore, $c$ is a divisor of $k_i-1$ for each $i=1,2,\\cdots,r$. Since $c$ is a positive integer, we must have $c\\le k_i-1$ for each $i=1,2,\\cdots,r$. Therefore, $c\\le\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)$. Since $n$ has $x$ positive divisors, we have $x=(k_1+1)(k_2+1)\\cdots(k_r+1)$. Therefore, $c\\le\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)\\le x-1$. Since $c$ is a positive integer, we have $c\\le x-1$. Therefore, $c\\le\\min\\{x-1,\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)\\}$. Since $c$ is a divisor of $x$, we have $c\\le x$. Therefore, $c\\le\\min\\{x,\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)\\}$. Since $c$ is a divisor of $\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)$, we have $c\\le\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)$. Therefore, $c\\le\\min\\{x,\\min_{1\\le i\\le r}(k_i-1)\\}=\\min\\{x,x-1\\}=x-1$. Therefore, $c=x-1$. Since $c$ is a divisor of $ax+b$, we have $ax+b=pc$ for some positive integer $p$. Since $c=x-1$, we have $ax+b=p(x-1)$. Therefore, $a+b+c=a+b+x-1=x$. Therefore, the final answer is $x$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x}$. I hope it is correct.",
