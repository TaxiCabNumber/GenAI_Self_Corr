        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that a $30$-digit integer $N$ is composed of thirteen $7$s and seventeen $3$s. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $36$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nFirst, we can find the sum of the digits of $N$:\n\n$$7\\cdot13+3\\cdot17=91+51=142$$\n\nSince $36$ divides $142$ with remainder $22$, $N$ also divides $36$ with remainder $22$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{22}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when $N$ is divided by $4$ and $9$. The last two digits of $N$ must be one of $33, 37, 73,$ or $77$; each of these leave a remainder of $1$ after division by $4$. By the divisibility property of $4$, it follows that $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$.\n\nThe sum of the digits of $N$ is equal to $13 \\times 7 + 17 \\times 3 = 142 = 15 \\times 9 + 7$. This leaves a remainder of $7$ after division by $9$, so it follows that $N \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, it follows that $N \\equiv 25 \\pmod{36}$ satisfies the two congruences, and so $N$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{25}$ upon division by $36$."
