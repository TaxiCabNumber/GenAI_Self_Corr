At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf March 1 is a Monday, what day of the week will it be 270 days later?",
        "inference": "Since March has 31 days, 270 days later will be 270 - 31 = 239 days later.\n239 days is 34 weeks and 1 day (239 = 34 * 7 + 1).\nSince March 1 is a Monday, 34 weeks later will also be a Monday, and 1 day later will be Tuesday.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{Tuesday}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are $7$ days in a week, we first divide $270$ by $7$ to get $38 \\text{ R}4$. Therefore, there are $38$ weeks and $4$ days in $270$ days. Since it is still Monday $38$ weeks after March 1, we consider the extra four days. Four days after a Monday is a $\\boxed{\\text{Friday}}$."
