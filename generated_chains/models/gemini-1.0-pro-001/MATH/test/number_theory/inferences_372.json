At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat value of $k$ makes the positive five-digit integer $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18?",
        "inference": "We see that $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by 9 and by 2.  Since $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 2, $k$ must be even, so $k = 2x$ for some integer $x$.  Then $k3,\\!57k = 2x357x = 6x357x.$  Since $x357x$ is divisible by 9, so is $6x357x.$  Therefore, $k = 2x$ makes $k3,\\!57k$ divisible by 18 for any integer $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{k = 2x}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since $18=2\\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\\boxed{6}$."
