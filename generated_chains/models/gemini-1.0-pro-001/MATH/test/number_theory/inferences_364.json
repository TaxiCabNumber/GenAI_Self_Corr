        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book with 50 pages numbered 1 through 50 has its pages renumbered in reverse, from 50 to 1. For how many pages do both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of pages that share the same ones digit.\n\n- Pages 1 and 50 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 2 and 49 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 3 and 48 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 4 and 47 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 5 and 46 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 6 and 45 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 7 and 44 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 8 and 43 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n- Pages 9 and 42 have the same ones digit, so $1$ page has the same ones digit.\n\nSo, the total number of pages that share the same ones digit is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\\\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For any given page, the sum of the original page number and the new page number is 51, an odd number. Therefore, no page is such that both sets of page numbers share the same ones digit and the answer is $\\boxed{0}$."
