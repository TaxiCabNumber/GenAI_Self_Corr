The last Friday of February $2008$ will be $29$ days after the first Friday of February $2008$, which is $29$ days after February $1$, $2008$.  Since February $1$, $2008$ is a Friday, the last Friday of February $2008$ will be $\\boxed{29}$ days after February $1$, $2008$, which is February $29$, $2008$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29}$.
