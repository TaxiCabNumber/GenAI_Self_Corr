At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common divisor of all of the members of the set containing all numbers that are the product of four consecutive positive integers?",
        "inference": "The product of four consecutive positive integers can be expressed as:\n\n$$n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$$\n\nThe greatest common divisor (GCD) of any two consecutive integers is 1. So, the GCD of any three consecutive integers is also 1. Therefore, the GCD of four consecutive integers is also 1. Hence, the GCD of all of the members of the set containing all numbers that are the product of four consecutive positive integers is 1.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "These numbers are all in the form $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)\\pmod 4$, there will be one number of each residue, so one of the numbers will be divisible by 2 and another divisible by 4, leaving the product divisible by 8. Similarly, one of the numbers will be $0\\mod 3$, so the product will be divisible by 3. The GCD must therefore be divisible by $3\\cdot8=24$. It also must be less than or equal to the smallest number in the set, $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$, so it must be $\\boxed{24}$ exactly."
