At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne gear turns $33\\frac{1}{3}$ times in a minute.  Another gear turns   45 times in a minute.  Initially, a mark on each gear is pointing  due north.  After how many seconds will the two gears next  have both their marks pointing due north?",
        "inference": "The first gear turns $\\frac{100}{3}$ times in a minute, or $\\frac{100}{3 \\times 60} = \\frac{5}{9}$ times in a second.  In $t$ seconds, it will turn $\\frac{5}{9}t$ times, or $\\frac{5}{9}t \\times 360 = 200t$ degrees.  The second gear turns $45 \\times 60 = 2700$ degrees in a minute, or $45$ degrees in a second.  In $t$ seconds, it will turn $45t$ degrees.  We want to find $t$ such that $200t$ and $45t$ are both multiples of $360$, so that both gears have marks pointing due north.  This happens when $t$ is a multiple of $360/45 = 8$.  The smallest such value of $t$ is $t = 8$ seconds.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "One gear turns $33\\frac{1}{3}=100/3$ times in 60 seconds, so it turns 5/9 times in one second, or 5 times in 9 seconds. The other gear turns 45 times in 60 seconds, so it turns 3/4 times in one second, or 3 times in 4 seconds. To find out after how many seconds the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north, we have to find the least common multiple of $4=2^2$ and $9=3^2$, which is $2^2\\cdot3^2=36$. Therefore, the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north after $\\boxed{36}$ seconds. (One gear turns exactly $5\\times4=20$ times, and the other gear turns exactly $3\\times9=27$ times.)"
