At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $n$ be a positive integer and let $k$ be the number of positive integers less than $2^n$ that are invertible modulo $2^n$. If $2^n\\equiv 3\\pmod{13}$, then what is the remainder when $k$ is divided by $13$?",

Therefore, $n$ must be odd, and so $k$ is the number of positive integers less than $2^n$ that are invertible modulo $2^n$.  There are $2^n-1$ such integers, and the only ones that are not invertible are those that are divisible by $2$.  There are $2^{n-1}$ such integers, so $k=2^n-2^{n-1}=2^{n-1}$.  Since $n$ is odd, $n-1$ is even, and so $2^{n-1}\\equiv 0\\pmod{13}$.  Therefore, $k\\equiv 0\\pmod{13}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.**",
