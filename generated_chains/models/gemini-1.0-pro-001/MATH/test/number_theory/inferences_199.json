At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the repetend in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{19}$ contains 18 digits, find the 39th digit in the decimal representation.",
        "inference": "The repetend is the part of the decimal representation that repeats forever. Since the repetend contains 18 digits, the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{19}$ can be written as:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{19} = 0.\\overline{052631578947368421}$$\n\nThe 39th digit in the decimal representation is the 12th digit in the repetend, which is 1.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Since $39 = 2 \\times 18 + 3$, the $39$th digit past the decimal point is the same as the $3$rd digit past the decimal point. To find this, we can directly divide: $$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & .0 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n19 & 1 & .0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 9 & 5 & \\downarrow \\\\ \\cline{2-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 5 & 0 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 3 & 8 \\\\ \\cline{4-5}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\end{array} $$ Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
