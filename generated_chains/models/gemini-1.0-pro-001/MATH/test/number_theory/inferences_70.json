At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree consecutive prime numbers, each less than $100$, have a sum that is a multiple of 5. What is the greatest possible sum?",
        "inference": "Let the three prime numbers be $p$, $p+2$, and $p+4$. We know that $p$ is odd, so $p+2$ is even and $p+4$ is odd. Therefore, the sum of the three prime numbers is odd.\n\nSince the sum of the three prime numbers is a multiple of 5, it must be greater than or equal to 5. The only odd multiple of 5 less than 100 is 45.\n\nTo find the three prime numbers, we need to find an odd prime number $p$ such that $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime numbers. The only such prime number less than 100 is $p=41$. Therefore, the three prime numbers are 41, 43, and 47, and their sum is 131.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$131$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The primes less than 100 are, in decreasing order, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2. Starting with the first triple of primes on the list, add the remainders when each prime is divided by 5 and see whether the sum is a multiple of 5, in which case the sum of the three consecutive primes is a multiple of 5: 2+4+3=9, 4+3+4=11, 3+4+3=10. Aha! This means that $83+79+73=\\boxed{235}$ is the greatest possible sum of three consecutive prime numbers, each less than 100, that have a sum that is a multiple of 5."
