At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo brothers took $x$ cows to the market, and they sold each cow for $x$ dollars. After selling the cows, they divided the money by giving $\\$10$ to the older brother, $\\$10$ to the younger brother, $\\$10$ to the older, $\\$10$ to the younger, and so on. At the last division of money, the older brother received $\\$10$, but the younger brother received less than $\\$10$. How many dollars must the younger brother have received at the last division?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The total amount of money received by the brothers is $x \\times x = x^2$.\n\n**Step 2:** The amount of money given to each brother by the other brother is $10$.\n\n**Step 3:** The number of times the brothers divided the money is $(x^2 - 20)/20$.\n\n**Step 4:** The amount of money received by the younger brother at the last division is the remainder after dividing the total amount by 20.\n\n**Step 5:** The remainder is $x^2 - 20 \\times ((x^2 - 20)/20) = x^2 - 20 \\times (x^2/20 - 1) = x^2 - x^2 + 20 = 20$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Write $x$ in the form $10a + b$, where $b$ is the units digit of $x$ and $a$ is the \"remaining\" part of $x$.  (For example, if $x = 5718$, then $a = 571$ and $b = 8$.)  Then \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2.\\]Since the older brother was the last brother to receive a whole payment of $\\$10$, the tens digit of $x^2$ must be odd.  The tens digit of $100a^2$ is 0, and the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so for the tens digit of \\[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2\\]to be odd, the tens digit of $b^2$ must be odd.\n\nWe know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9.  Checking these digits, we find that the tens digit of $b^2$ is odd only for $b = 4$ and $b = 6$.\n\nWe also see that the units digit of $x^2$ is the same as the units digit of $b^2$.  For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ is 6.  Therefore, the last payment to the younger brother was $\\boxed{6}$ dollars."
