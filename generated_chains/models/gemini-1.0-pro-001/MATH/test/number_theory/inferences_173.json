At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that $k$ is a positive integer less than 6, how many values can $k$ take on such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions in $x$?",
        "inference": "The given congruence can be rewritten as $3x -k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$.\nThis congruence has no solutions in $x$ if and only if $3$ and $k$ are relatively prime.\nSince $k$ is a positive integer less than $6$, the only possible values for $k$ are $1$ and $5$.\nTherefore, $k$ can take on $\\boxed{2}$ values such that the given congruence has no solutions in $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that the left-hand side is divisible by 3. Therefore, since 3 divides 6, the left-hand side will be equivalent to a multiple of 3. Therefore, if $k$ were to be 1, 2, 4, or 5, then the given congruence would have no solutions. On the other hand, if $k=0$ or $k=3$, then $x=0$ and $x=1$ (respectively) satisfy the given congruence. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ values of $k$ such that $3x \\equiv k \\pmod{6}$ has no solutions."
