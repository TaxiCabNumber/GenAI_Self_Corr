At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nArnold must water his cactus plants every 9 days and he must feed them every 60 days. He watered and fed them last Tuesday. What day of the week will it be the next time he waters and feeds them on the same day?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n1. The number of days until Arnold waters his plants again is a multiple of 9.\n2. The number of days until Arnold feeds his plants again is a multiple of 60.\n3. The smallest number that is a multiple of both 9 and 60 is 360.\n4. Therefore, Arnold will water and feed his plants on the same day again in 360 days.\n5. Starting from last Tuesday, Arnold will water and feed his plants on the same day again in 360 days, which is 51 weeks and 3 days.\n6. 51 weeks is equal to 357 days.\n7. Therefore, Arnold will water and feed his plants on the same day again in 357 days + 3 days = 360 days after last Tuesday.\n8. 360 days after last Tuesday is Tuesday.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{Tuesday}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The next time he feeds and waters them on the same day is after $\\text{lcm}(9,60)=180$ days.  Now to determine the day of the week we compute  \\[180\\equiv5\\pmod7.\\] This day falls 5 days later in the week than a Tuesday, so he next feeds them on the same day on a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$."
