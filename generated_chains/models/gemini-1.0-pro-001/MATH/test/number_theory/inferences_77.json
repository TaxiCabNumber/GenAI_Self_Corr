At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the six consecutive positive odd numbers be \n\n$$(2n+1,2n+3,2n+5,2n+7,2n+9,2n+11).$$\n\nThen their sum is\n\n$$(2n+1)+(2n+3)+(2n+5)+(2n+7)+(2n+9)+(2n+11)=$$\n\n$$12n+36=12(n+3).$$\n\nSince 12 is a multiple of 4, any multiple of 12 must be a multiple of 4. Therefore, the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers is a multiple of 4. Since 4 is the greatest whole number that divides any multiple of 4, it is the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any six consecutive positive odd numbers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-5$, $2n-3$, $2n-1$, $2n+1$, $2n+3$, and $2n+5$ be six consecutive positive odd numbers. Their sum is $(2n-5)+(2n-3)+(2n-1)+(2n+1)+(2n+3)+(2n+5)=12n$. Clearly, for any value of $n$, $12$ must divide the sum. By choosing $n=3$ and $n=5$, we can see that $\\boxed{12}$ is the largest whole number that must be a factor."
