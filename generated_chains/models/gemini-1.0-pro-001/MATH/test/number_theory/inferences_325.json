        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDonut Haven fries donuts in batches of $20$, but sells them in boxes of $13$.\n\nIf Donut Haven fries just enough batches of $20$ to pack $44$ full boxes of $13$ donuts, how many donuts will be left over?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nDonut Haven fries $20$ donuts per batch, and $44$ full boxes of $13$ donuts are packed. So the total number of donuts fried is $44\\times 13 = 572$.\n\nSince $572$ is divisible by $20$, there are no donuts left over.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem using modular arithmetic. Donut Haven needs to fry at least $44\\cdot 13$ donuts. Working modulo $20$, we have \\begin{align*}\n44\\cdot 13 &\\equiv 4\\cdot 13 \\\\\n&= 52 \\\\\n&\\equiv 12\\qquad\\pmod{20}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of donuts in $44$ full boxes is $12$ more than a multiple of $20$, which means it's $8$ less than the next multiple of $20$. Donut Haven will have $\\boxed{8}$ donuts left over."
