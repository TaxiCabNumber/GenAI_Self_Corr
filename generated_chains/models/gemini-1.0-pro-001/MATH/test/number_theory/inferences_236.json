At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA base-10 three-digit number $n$ is selected at random. What is the probability that the base-9 representation and the base-11 representation of $n$ are both three-digit numerals?",
        "inference": "The base-10 number $n$ is a three-digit number, so it can be written as $n=100a+10b+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits from 0 to 9.\nThe base-9 representation of $n$ is $n=9^2a'+9b'+c'$, where $a'$, $b'$, and $c'$ are digits from 0 to 8.\nThe base-11 representation of $n$ is $n=11^2a''+11b''+c''$, where $a''$, $b''$, and $c''$ are digits from 0 to 10.\nFor the base-9 and base-11 representations of $n$ to both be three-digit numerals, we must have $0\\leq a'\\leq 8$, $0\\leq b'\\leq 8$, and $0\\leq c'\\leq 8$, and $0\\leq a''\\leq 10$, $0\\leq b''\\leq 10$, and $0\\leq c''\\leq 10$.\nThe number of possible digits for $a'$, $b'$, and $c'$ is 9, and the number of possible digits for $a''$, $b''$, and $c''$ is 11.\nTherefore, the number of possible base-9 representations of $n$ is $9^3=729$, and the number of possible base-11 representations of $n$ is $11^3=1331$.\nThe number of possible base-9 and base-11 representations of $n$ that are both three-digit numerals is $9^3\\cdot11^3=729\\cdot1331=969859$.\nThe number of possible three-digit base-10 numbers is $10^3=1000$.\nTherefore, the probability that the base-9 representation and the base-11 representation of $n$ are both three-digit numerals is $\\frac{969859}{1000}=0.969859$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.969859}$.
