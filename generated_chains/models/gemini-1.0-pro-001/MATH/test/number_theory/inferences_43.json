At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn this problem, $a$ and $b$ are integers, such that $a \\ge b.$\n\nIf $a+b\\equiv 2\\pmod{10}$ and $2a+b\\equiv 1\\pmod{10}$, then what is the last digit of $a-b$?",
