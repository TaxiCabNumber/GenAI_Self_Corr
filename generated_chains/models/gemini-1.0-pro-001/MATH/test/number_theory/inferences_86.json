At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many factors of 1000 can be divided by 20 without a remainder?",
        "inference": "1000 has the prime factorization $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$.\n\nTo be divisible by 20 without a remainder, the number must have the prime factorization $2^2 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nSo 1000 has $3-2=1$ extra factor of 2 and $3-2=1$ extra factor of 5.\n\nSo there are $1\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{1}$ such factors of 1000.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can think of 1000 as $20 \\times 50$. The factors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50. If we multiply each of these 6 factors of 50 by 20, we  will get the six ($\\boxed{6}$) factors of 1000 that can be divided evenly by 20. They are 20, 40, 100, 200, 500 and 1000."
