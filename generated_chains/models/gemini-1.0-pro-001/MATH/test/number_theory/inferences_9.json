At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The hundreds digit can be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. \n\nWe want the number to be divisible by both digits, so the hundreds digit must be divisible by the tens digit. \n\nThe only hundreds digits that are divisible by 1 are 1, 2, 5, and 10, but there is no such thing as a double-digit number with a tens digit of 10. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit must be either 1, 2, or 5.\n\nIf the hundreds digit is 1, then the tens digit must be 1. But this is not a two-digit number. \n\nIf the hundreds digit is 2, then the tens digit must be 1 or 2. But the two-digit number 21 is not divisible by its digits because 2 is not divisible by 1.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit must be 5. \n\nThe tens digit must be either 1 or 5. \n\nIf the tens digit is 5, then we have the number 55, which is divisible by both of its digits. \n\nIf the tens digit is 1, then we have the number 51, which is also divisible by both of its digits. \n\nSo, the largest two-digit number that is divisible by both of its digits, and the digits are distinct, is 55. \nFinal Answer: \\boxed{55}.

        "ground_truth": "Since we are looking for the largest number, we should start at 99 and work our way down.  No number in the 90s works, because the only numbers divisible by $9$ are $90$ and $99$. $90$ is invalid because no number is divisible by zero, and $99$ is invalid because the digits are the same.  The same reasoning applies to numbers with $8$, $7$, $6$, or $5$ in the tens place.  When we get to the 40s, however, there are three numbers that are divisible by $4$: $40$, $44$, and $48$. $48$ is also divisible by $8$, so the number we are looking for is $\\boxed{48}.$"
