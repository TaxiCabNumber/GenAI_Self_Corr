        "inference": "1. $n = 3q + 1$ for some integer $q$.\n2. $n = 4r + 1$ for some integer $r$.\n3. $n = 5s + 4$ for some integer $s$.\n\nEquating the first two equations, we get $3q + 1 = 4r + 1$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $3q = 4r$. Dividing both sides by 4, we get $q = \\frac{4r}{3}$. Since $r$ is an integer, $q$ must be a multiple of 3. The smallest positive integer multiple of 3 is 3, so $q = 3$. Substituting $q = 3$ into the first equation, we get $n = 3(3) + 1 = 10$.\n\nChecking the third equation, we get $10 = 5(2) + 0$. This means that $n$ has remainder 0 when divided by 5, which is not what we want.\n\nWe can try the next multiple of 3, $q = 6$. Substituting $q = 6$ into the first equation, we get $n = 3(6) + 1 = 19$.\n\nChecking the third equation, we get $19 = 5(3) + 4$. This means that $n$ has remainder 4 when divided by 5, which is what we want.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n$ has remainder 1 when divided by 3, $n$ has remainder 1 when divided by 4, and $n$ has remainder 4 when divided by 5 is $n = 19$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{19}.

        "ground_truth": "Since $\\text{gcd}(3,4) = 1$, the first two requirements imply that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$. We list the first few numbers that are $1\\pmod{12}$, $$13,25,37,49,...$$We see that $\\boxed{49}$ is the first value with remainder $4$ when divided by $5$."
