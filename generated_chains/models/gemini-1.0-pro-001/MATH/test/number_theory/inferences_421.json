        "inference": "$$(1+2+3+\\cdots+n)^2=\\left[\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right]^2=\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$$\n\nSo, we need to find $n$ such that $\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$ is a perfect fourth power. Let $n^2(n+1)^2=4a^4$. Then, $n^2(n+1)^2=2^4a^4=(2a^2)^4$, so $n(n+1)=2a^2$ and $n^2+n=4a^4$.\n\nSince $n>3$, we have $n+1>4$ and $n(n+1)>12$. So, $2a^2>12$ and $a^2>6$. The smallest integer $a$ that satisfies this inequality is $a=3$, so $n(n+1)=2a^2=18$ and $n(n+1)=18$.\n\nThe only positive integer $n$ that satisfies this equation is $n=\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$.

        "ground_truth": "First, note the well-known formula that $1+2+3+\\cdots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Thus we are looking for $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is a perfect square. Since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, the odd one will have to be a perfect square, and the even one will have to be twice a perfect square. Thus we are looking for solutions to $a^2-2b^2=\\pm 1$ where $a^2 \\ge 4$. It's clear $b=1$ does not work, but trying $b=2$, we find that $2(2^2)+1=9=3^2$. Therefore, $n=2(2^2)=\\boxed{8}$ is the smallest solution. We may confirm our answer by checking that $\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2=36^2$ when $n=8$, and indeed $36^2=6^4$ is a perfect fourth power."
