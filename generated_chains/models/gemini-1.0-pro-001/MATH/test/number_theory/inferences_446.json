At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three consecutive integers is a multiple of 89 and is a value between 600 and 900. What is the sum of the three integers?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the three consecutive integers as x, x + 1, and x + 2. According to the given information, x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 3x + 3 = 89k for some integer k, where 600 \u2264 3x + 3 \u2264 900.\n\nSubtracting 3 from the inequality, we get 600 - 3 \u2264 3x \u2264 900 - 3, which simplifies to 597 \u2264 3x \u2264 897.\n\nDividing both sides of the inequality by 3, we get 199 \u2264 x \u2264 299.\n\nSince x is an integer, the only possible value for x is x = 200. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 200, 201, and 202.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{603}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. We have $(n-1)+n+(n+1)=3n=89a$ for some positive integer $a$. Since $(3,89)=1$, $a$ must be a multiple of 3, say $a=3b$ for a positive integer $b$. We must have $600\\le89\\cdot3b\\le900\\Rightarrow 600\\le267b\\le900\\Rightarrow2<b<4$. Therefore, $b=3$, which means $3n=267\\cdot3=\\boxed{801}$."
