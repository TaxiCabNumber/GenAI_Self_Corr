At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn base $10$, the number $2013$ ends in the digit $3$.  In base $9$, on the other hand, the same number is written as $(2676)_{9}$ and ends in the digit $6$.  For how many values of $b$ does the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ end in the digit $3$?",
        "inference": "We are looking for the bases $b$ for which $3$ is the remainder when $2013$ is divided by $b$. Since $2676\\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$, we can multiply both sides by $3$ and get $7828\\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. Therefore, the remainder when $2013$ is divided by $9$ is the same as the remainder when $7828$ is divided by $9$, which is $6$. Thus, the remainder when $2013$ is divided by $9$ is $6$, and hence $9$ does not satisfy the given condition.\n\nSimilarly, we can check that $2013 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{10}$, $2013 \\equiv 11 \\pmod{11}$, $2013 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{12}$, and $2013 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{13}$. Therefore, $10, 11, 12$, and $13$ do not satisfy the given condition.\n\nOn the other hand, it is easy to check that $2013 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{3}$ and $2013 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, $3$ and $4$ satisfy the given condition.\n\nFurthermore, we can check that $2013 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, $2013 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$, $2013 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, and $2013 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. Therefore, $5, 6, 7$, and $8$ do not satisfy the given condition.\n\nFinally, we can check that $2013 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{14}$. Therefore, $14$ satisfies the given condition.\n\nIn conclusion, the base-$b$-representation of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$ for $b = 3, 4, 14$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The base-$b$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$ if and only if $2013$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $b$: that is, if $2010$ is a multiple of $b.$ Since $2010 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 67^1,$ it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ positive divisors. However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$). Therefore, the answer is $16 - 3 = \\boxed{13}.$"
