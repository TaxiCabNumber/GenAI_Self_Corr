At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 64 is both a perfect cube and a perfect square, since $4^3 = 64$ and $8^2 = 64$. What is the next larger number that is both a perfect cube and a perfect square?",
        "inference": "Since 64 is $8^2$, the next larger perfect square is $9^2 = 81$. Since 64 is $4^3$, the next larger perfect cube is $5^3 = 125$. Thus, the next larger number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 125.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{125}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power. $2^6=64$ and the next such number is $3^6=\\boxed{729}$."
