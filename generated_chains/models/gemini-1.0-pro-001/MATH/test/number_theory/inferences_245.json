At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the units digit of the product of all of the odd integers between 0 and 12?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $N$ be the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. Thus, $N=1\\times3\\times5\\times7\\times9\\times11= 5(1\\times3\\times7\\times9\\times11)$. The product of odd integers is odd, and the units digit of 5 times any odd number is $5$. Therefore,  the units digit of $N$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
