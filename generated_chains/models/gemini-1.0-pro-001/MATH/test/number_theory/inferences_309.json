At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The sum of a particular set of three consecutive positive integers is a three-digit palindrome. If the sum is less than 220, what is the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be x, x + 1, and x + 2.\n\nThe sum of these three numbers is x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 3x + 3.\n\nThis sum must be a three-digit palindrome, which means that it must be a number between 100 and 999 that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nThe only three-digit palindromes that are sums of three consecutive positive integers are 108 (35 + 36 + 37), 132 (43 + 44 + 45), 156 (51 + 52 + 53), 180 (59 + 60 + 61), and 204 (67 + 68 + 69).\n\nSince the sum of the three integers is less than 220, the only possible palindrome is 108.\n\nThe largest integer in the set of three consecutive positive integers is x + 2, so the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers is x + 2 = 37.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{37}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the set $\\{n-1, n, n+1\\}$ of three consecutive integers is $3n$.  Therefore, we are looking for the largest three-digit palindromic multiple of $3$ less than $220$.  Checking through $212, 202, 191, 181$, and $171$, we find that $171$ is the greatest palindrome which is also a multiple of $3$.  Solving $3n=171$ for $n$ we find $n=57$. The three integers are $56,57,58$, and the greatest is $\\boxed{58}$."
