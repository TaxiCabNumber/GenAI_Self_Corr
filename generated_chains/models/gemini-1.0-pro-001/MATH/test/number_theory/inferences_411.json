        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{141}{400}$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. First, find the prime factorization of the denominator:\n\n$$400 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$$\n\n2. Look at the exponents of the prime factors in the denominator:\n\n$$2^4 \\text{ and } 5^2$$\n\n3. Since the numerator does not have any factors of 2 or 5, the denominator will contribute the exponents of 2 and 5 to the denominator of the decimal expansion.\n\n4. The exponent of 2 in the denominator is 4, so the decimal expansion will have $4-3=1$ zero to the right of the decimal point.\n\n5. The exponent of 5 in the denominator is 2, so the decimal expansion will have $2-2=0$ zero to the right of the decimal point due to the 5s.\n\n6. Therefore, there will be a total of $1+0=1$ zero to the right of the decimal point.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $400 = 4 \\cdot 10^2 = 2^2 \\cdot 10^2 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\\frac{141}{400} = \\frac{141}{2^4 \\cdot 5^2}$. If we multiply this fraction by $10^4$, we shift all digits $4$ places to the left, so $\\frac{141}{2^4 \\cdot 5^2} \\cdot 10^4 = 141 \\cdot 5^2 = 3525$. The last nonzero digit is therefore $\\boxed{5}$."
