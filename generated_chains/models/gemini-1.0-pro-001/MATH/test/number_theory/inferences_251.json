At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S = 2010 + 2011 + \\cdots + 4018$. Compute the residue of $S$, modulo 2009.",

In this case, we have $a_1 = 2010$ and $a_n = 4018$. So, $S = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{n}{2} (2010 + 4018) = \\frac{n}{2} (6028) = 3014n$.\n3. We want to find the residue of $S$ modulo 2009. So, we need to find the remainder when $3014n$ is divided by 2009.\n4. We can use the division algorithm to find the remainder. We have $3014 = 1 \\cdot 2009 + 5$. So, the remainder is $5$.\n5. Therefore, the residue of $S$ modulo 2009 is $5$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
