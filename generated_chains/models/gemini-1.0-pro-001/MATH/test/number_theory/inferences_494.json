        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive integer $M$ divided by six gives a remainder of three. Another positive integer $N$ divided by six gives a remainder of five. What is the remainder when the sum $M+N$ is divided by six?",
        "inference": "The remainder when $M$ is divided by six is three. So, $M$ can be expressed as $6k+3$ for some integer $k$.\n\nThe remainder when $N$ is divided by six is five. So, $N$ can be expressed as $6l+5$ for some integer $l$.\n\nThe sum $M+N$ can be expressed as $6k+3+6l+5 = 6(k+l)+8$.\n\nThe remainder when $M+N$ is divided by six is $8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "This means that $M$ is in the form $6m+3$ for an integer $m$ and $N$ is in the form $6n+5$ for an integer $n$. $M+N=6m+6n+8=6(m+n+1)+2$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ after division by 6."
