The least common multiple of those numbers is 12, so $n-1$ must be a multiple of 12. The multiples of 12 less than 75 are 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. Adding 1 results in 13, 25, 37, 49, and 61, where 49 is the only multiple of 7. So Rosa is $\\boxed{49}$ years old.\n\nOR\n\nWe look for a multiple of 7 that is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 6.
