        "inference": "- Carlos was born on November 9, 2002, which was a Saturday.\n\n- To find the day of the week for 706 days later, we can divide 706 by 7 (the number of days in a week) to find the number of complete weeks.\n\n- 706 \u00f7 7 = 100 with a remainder of 6.\n\n- This means that Carlos will be 100 weeks old plus 6 days old.\n\n- To find the day of the week, we can start with Saturday (the day he was born) and count forward 6 days.\n\n- Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.\n\n- 6 days after Saturday is **Friday**.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$Friday$}.
