At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n>1$ is an integer, the notation $a\\equiv b\\pmod{n}$ means that $(a-b)$ is a multiple of $n$. Find the sum of all possible values of $n$ such that both of the following are true: $171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$ and $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince $171\\equiv80\\pmod{n}$, we have $171-80=91$ is a multiple of $n$, so $n$ is a divisor of $91$.  Similarly, since $468\\equiv13\\pmod{n}$, we have $468-13=455$ is a multiple of $n$, so $n$ is a divisor of $455$.  Thus, $n$ is a common divisor of $91$ and $455$.  The prime factorizations of $91$ and $455$ are $91=7\\cdot13$ and $455=5\\cdot7\\cdot13$, so the common divisors of $91$ and $455$ are $1$, $7$, $13$, and $91$.  The sum of these divisors is $1+7+13+91=\\boxed{112}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $112$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "As we are told, we want to find all values of $n>1$ such that $n$ divides into $171-80 = 91$ and $n$ also divides into $468 - 13 = 455$. We notice that $455 = 5 \\cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\\{1,7,13,91\\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = \\boxed{111}$."
