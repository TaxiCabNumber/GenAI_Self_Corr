At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA book is said to have $n$ leaves if it is composed of $n$ pieces of paper. On the other hand, the number of pages is twice the number of leaves because each side of a piece of paper is defined as a page.\n\nIf the number of pages in a book is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, and the number of leaves is greater than $100$, then what is the smallest possible number of leaves?",
        "inference": "Let's assume that the number of pages in the book is $x$. Then, the number of leaves is $x/2$. Since the number of pages is $3$ more than a multiple of $7$, we have $x=7k+3$ for some integer $k$. We also know that the number of leaves is greater than $100$, so $x/2>100$. Substituting $x=7k+3$ into this inequality, we get $7k+3/2>100$. Multiplying both sides by $2$, we get $7k+3>200$. Subtracting $3$ from both sides, we get $7k>197$. Dividing both sides by $7$, we get $k>28.14...$. Since $k$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $k$ is $29$. Therefore, the smallest possible number of pages is $x=7k+3=7(29)+3=204$. The number of leaves is $x/2=204/2=102$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{102}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ be the least possible number of leaves. Then $2m$ is the least possible number of pages. We know that $2m\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies 8m \\equiv 3\\cdot 4\\pmod 7\\implies m\\equiv 12\\equiv 5\\pmod 7$. So $m=5+7a$ for some positive integer $a$. The smallest such number greater than $100$ is $5+7\\cdot 14=\\boxed{103}$."
