        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $b$ and $c$ are positive integers.\n\nWhen $b^2$ is written in base $c$, the result is $121_c$. When $c^2$ is written in base $b$, the result is $71_b$.\n\nWhat is $b+c$?",
        "inference": "Since $b^2=121_c=c^2+c+1$ and $c^2=71_b=b^2+b$, we have\n\n$$c^2+c+1=b^2+b\\Rightarrow c^2-b^2+c-b+1=0\\Rightarrow (c-b)(c+b+1)=b-1\\ge 0.$$Since $c-b\\ge 0$ and $c+b+1\\ge 0$, we have $c\\ge b$. If $c=b$, then $c+b+1=2c+1$ and $b-1$ are both odd, which is impossible. Thus, $c>b$. Thus, $c+b+1>b\\ge b-1$, so we must have $c+b+1=b-1$. Thus, $c+b=b-2$, so $c=b-2$. Therefore, $b+c=b+(b-2)=2b-2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2b-2}$. I hope it is correct.",

Thus $$b^2-2b+1 = 7b+1.$$Adding $2b-1$ to both sides, we have $$b^2=9b.$$The only positive solution is $b=9$, which gives $c=8$ and thus $b+c=\\boxed{17}$."
