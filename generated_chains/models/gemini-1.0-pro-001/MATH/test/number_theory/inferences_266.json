At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe units digit of a three-digit number is 6. What is the probability that the number is divisible by 6? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 10 choices for the hundreds digit, 10 choices for the tens digit, and 6 choices for the units digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 9). So there are $10\\times10\\times6=600$ possible three-digit numbers.\n\nTo be divisible by 6, a number must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\nA number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is divisible by 2. So there are $10\\times10=100$ three-digit numbers with a units digit of 6.\n\nA number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number with a units digit of 6 is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of the hundreds and tens digits is divisible by 3.

        "ground_truth": "The common difference of the arithmetic sequence 106, 116, 126, ..., 996 is relatively prime to 3.  Therefore, given any three consecutive terms, exactly one of them is divisible by 3.  Since there are $1+(996-106)/10=90$ terms in the sequence, $90/3=30$ of them are divisible by 3.  Since every term is even, a term is divisible by 3 if and only if it is divisible by 6.  Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected term in the sequence is a multiple of 6 is $30/90=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
