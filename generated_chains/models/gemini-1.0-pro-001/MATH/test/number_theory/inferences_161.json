At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Penteria is a special (fictional) kind of bacteria such that, regardless of the original population in a collection, the population increases by $5$ every minute. Additionally, at the end of every hour, all but the initial ones die. If $137$ Penteria are alive after $506$ minutes, how many were there at the beginning?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine how many hours have passed after 506 minutes\n506 minutes = 506/60 = 8 hours and 26 minutes\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of times the population increased by 5 within the 8 hours\n8 hours = 8 * 60 = 480 minutes\nPopulation increase = 480 * 5 = 2400\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the initial population\nInitial population + 2400 = 137\nInitial population = 137 - 2400 = -2263\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{-2263}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We have that $506\\equiv 26\\pmod {60}$, so $26$ minutes have passed in the latest hour. Let $a$ be the initial population. Then $a+26\\cdot 5=137\\implies a=137-26\\cdot 5=137-130=\\boxed{7}$."
