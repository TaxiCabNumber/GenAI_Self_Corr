At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the tens digit in the sum $11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \\ldots + 11^9$?",
        "inference": "The sum can be written as:\n\n$$S = 11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \\ldots + 11^9 = 11(1 + 11 + 11^2 + \\ldots + 11^8)$$\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n\n$$S = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1-r}$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms. In this case, $a = 11$, $r = 11$, and $n = 9$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$S = \\frac{11(1 - 11^9)}{1-11} = -11\\left(1 - 11^9\\right)$$\n\nThe tens digit of $-11\\left(1 - 11^9\\right)$ is the same as the tens digit of $-11$, which is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "First of all, we notice that $11 = 1 + 10,$ and so we write $11^n$ as follows: $$(1 + 10)^n = \\binom{n}{0} \\cdot 1^n + \\binom{n}{1} \\cdot 1^{n-1} \\cdot 10^{1} + \\binom{n}{2} \\cdot 1^{n-2} \\cdot 10^{2} + \\cdots$$ We can see that every term after the first two in our expansion has at least two powers of $10,$ therefore they will not contribute to the tens digit of anything. Meanwhile, the first term is always $1,$ and the second term can be simplified to $10n.$\n\nTherefore, we have: \\begin{align*}\n&11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \\cdots + 11^9 \\\\\n&\\qquad\\equiv (1 + 10) + (1 + 20) + \\cdots + (1 + 90) \\pmod{100}. \\\\\n&\\qquad\\equiv 459 \\equiv 59 \\pmod{100}.\n\\end{align*} Thus, the tens digit must be $\\boxed{5}.$"
