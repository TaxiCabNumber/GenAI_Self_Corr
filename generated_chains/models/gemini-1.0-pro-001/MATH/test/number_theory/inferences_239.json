At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7?",
        "inference": "The remainder when Rachel divides her favorite number by 7 is 5. This means that her favorite number can be expressed in the form 7n + 5, where n is an integer.\n\nIf she multiplies her favorite number by 5, we get 5(7n + 5) = 35n + 25.\n\nDividing this by 7, we get (35n + 25) / 7 = 5n + 3 remainder 2.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7 is $\\boxed{2}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$, so $5n \\equiv 5 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 25 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{7}$."
