At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least prime number greater than 25 that will have a remainder of 2 when divided by 25?",
        "inference": "The least prime number greater than 25 is 29.\n\n29 divided by 25 is 1 with a remainder of 4.\n\nTherefore, the least prime number greater than 25 that will have a remainder of 2 when divided by 25 is 29 + 23 = 52.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We must find the least prime number, $p$, such that $p=25n+2$ for some positive integer $n$. It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25."
