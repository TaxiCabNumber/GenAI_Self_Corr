At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Start off by looking for a pattern. $(13^1 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder; $(13^2 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder, ..., $(13^k +5)/6$ always leaves no remainder. This is true because $13$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, so any power of $13$ will also be $1$ more than a multiple of $6$. When $5$ is added to a number that is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, the result is a multiple of $6$, so the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$."
