At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDetermine the number of integers $x$ such that $0\\le x< 12$ and $x$ satisfies the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n&x-1\\equiv 1-x\\pmod {12},\\\\\n&x-2\\equiv 2-x\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}",
        "inference": "The first equation implies $x-1+1-x\\equiv 0\\pmod{12}$, so $2\\equiv 0\\pmod{12}$, which implies $x\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}$. The second equation implies $x-2+2-x\\equiv 0\\pmod{12}$, so $4\\equiv 0\\pmod{12}$, which implies $x\\equiv 4\\pmod{6}$. Since $x\\equiv 1\\pmod{6}$ and $x\\equiv 4\\pmod{6}$, we have $x\\equiv 10\\pmod{6}$, so $x=10$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we simplify both of the congruence relationships to get:  \\begin{align*}\n&x-1\\equiv 1-x\\pmod {12}\\implies 2x\\equiv 2\\pmod{12},\\\\\n&x-2\\equiv 2-x\\pmod{12}\\implies 2x\\equiv 4\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Since $2x$ cannot be equivalent to both 2 and 4 mod 12, we know that there are $\\boxed{0}$ solutions."
