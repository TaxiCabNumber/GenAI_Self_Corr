At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a true-false test of 100 items, every question that is a multiple of 4 is true, and all others are false. If a student marks every item that is a multiple of 3 false and all others true, how many of the 100 items will be correctly answered?",

These 11 questions will be marked false by the student, even though the correct answer is true.\n- Out of the 33 questions that are multiples of 3, 11 are also multiples of 4 (as mentioned above). These 11 questions will be marked true by the student, even though the correct answer is false.\n- Therefore, the student will correctly answer 25 - 11 + 33 - 11 = 32 questions.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{32}.$ I hope it is correct.",

This happens when the answer is NOT a multiple of 3 but IS a multiple of 4.\n\nCase 2. both the student and the answer key say it is false. This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.\n\nSince the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases. So our final number of correct answers is $40 + 2 = \\boxed{42}$."
