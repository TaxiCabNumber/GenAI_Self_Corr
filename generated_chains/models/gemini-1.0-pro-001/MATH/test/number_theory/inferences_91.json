        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe superfactorial $n\\$$ is defined as $n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}$. What is the units digit of $4\\$$?",
        "inference": "First, we calculate $4! = 24$.\nThen, we calculate $24! = 620448401733239439360000$. \nTherefore, the units digit of $4\\$$ is the units digit of $620448401733239439360000^{620448401733239439360000}$.\nSince $0^n = 0$ for all positive integers $n$, we only need to consider the units digit of $6$.\nThe units digit of $6$ is $6$.\nTherefore, the units digit of $4\\$$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $4! = 4\\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$, we need to evaluate the units digit of $4\\$ = \\underbrace{24^{24^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^\\cdot}}}}_{24}$. The exponent of the base $24$ is an even number, say $2n$. Then, $4\\$ = 24^{2n} = 576^n$. The units digit of the product of two numbers with units digit $6$ is equal to $6$. Thus, the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
