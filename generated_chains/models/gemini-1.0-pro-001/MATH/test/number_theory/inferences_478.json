        "inference": "Step 1: Represent the number in base 3.\nThe number can be represented as:\n\n$$a_0 + a_1 \\cdot 3 + a_2 \\cdot 9 + ... + a_n \\cdot 3^n$$\n\nwhere $a_i$ are digits in base 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the range of digits.\nSince the number can only be written using digits 0 and 1, we have $0 \\leq a_i \\leq 1$.\n\nStep 3: Find the maximum value of the number.\nThe maximum value of the number is achieved when $a_i = 1$ for all $i$. Therefore, the maximum value is:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{99} 3^i = \\frac{3^{100} - 1}{2}$$\n\nStep 4: Find the smallest 100-digit number.\nThe smallest 100-digit number that can be written using only digits 0 and 1 is $10000...0_3$.\n\nStep 5: Subtract the smallest number from the maximum number.\nThe one hundredth positive integer that can be written using no digits other than digits 0 and 1 in base 3 is:\n\n$$\\frac{3^{100} - 1}{2} - 10000...0_3$$\n\nStep 6: Convert to base 10.\nWe can convert the number to base 10 using the following formula:\n\n$$N = a_0 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + ... + a_n \\cdot 10^n$$\n\nFor the given number, we have:\n\n$$N = \\frac{3^{100} - 1}{2} - 10000...0_3 = \\frac{3^{100} - 1}{2} - 1 \\cdot 3^{99} = 218586224$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{218586224}$.
