At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecall that an integer $d$ is said to be a divisor of an integer $a$ if $a/d$ is also an integer. For how many integers $a$ between $-200$ and $-1$ inclusive is the product of the divisors of $a$ negative?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**:  First, we list the integers $a$ between $-200$ and $-1$ inclusive that are perfect squares: \n\n$$-200, -196, -184, \\dots, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \\dots, 196$$ \n\n**Step 2**:  For each of these integers, we find the product of its divisors. For example, the divisors of $-100$ are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm5, \\pm10, \\pm20, \\pm25, \\pm50, \\pm100$ and their product is $(-1)^{2}\\cdot(2)^{2}\\cdot(5)^{2}=-1000$.\n\n**Step 3**:  We observe that the product of the divisors of a perfect square is always positive since it is the product of the squares of prime numbers (and possibly $-1$).\n\n**Step 4**:  Therefore, the only integers $a$ between $-200$ and $-1$ inclusive for which the product of the divisors of $a$ is negative are the integers that are not perfect squares. There are $200-(-200)+1=401$ such integers.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{401}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The product of the (positive and negative) divisors of an integer $a$ is negative if $a$ has an odd number of negative divisors. It follows that $-a$ must have an odd number of positive divisors. However, for every positive divisor $d$ of $-a$, then $(-a)/d$ is also a positive divisor of $-a$, so that the positive divisors of $-a$ can be paired up. The exception is if $-a$ is a perfect square, in which case $\\sqrt{-a}$ will not be paired up with another divisor. There are $\\boxed{14}$ perfect squares between $1$ and $200$: $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\cdots, 14^2 = 196$."
