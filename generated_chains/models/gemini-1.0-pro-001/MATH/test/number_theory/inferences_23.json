        "inference": "Since $1560 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, we need $n \\geq 1560$ so that $n!$ contains all the prime factors of $1560$.  We also need $n$ to contain at least $3$ copies of the prime $2$, $1$ copy of the prime $3$, $1$ copy of the prime $5$, and $1$ copy of the prime $7$.  This is because $1560 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$.

However, $13!$ contains a factor of 13, as well as two factors of 5, five factors of 3, and ten factors of 2.  Therefore, the least value of $n$ for which 1560 divides $n!$ is $\\boxed{13}$."
