At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA positive integer is 3 more than a multiple of 4 and 4 more than a multiple of 5. What is the least integer it could be?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet $x$ be the multiple of 4. Then $x+3$ is the positive integer.\n\nLet $y$ be the multiple of 5. Then $y+4$ is the positive integer.\n\nSince $x+3$ and $y+4$ are the same positive integer, we have $$x+3=y+4.$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get $$x=y+1.$$\n\nSince $x$ is a multiple of 4 and $y$ is a multiple of 5, the least possible value of $x$ is 4 and the least possible value of $y$ is 5.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $x+3$ is $4+3=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$7$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let our integer be $n$.  Then $n = 4i + 3 = 5j + 4$ for positive integers $i,j$.  Thus $4i = 5j + 1$, to which the smallest possible solutions are $(i,j) = (4,3)$.  Thus $\\boxed{19}$ is the smallest possible value for $n$."
