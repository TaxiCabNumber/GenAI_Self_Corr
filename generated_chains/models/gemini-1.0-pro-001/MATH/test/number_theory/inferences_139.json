At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three digit numbers are there such that the digits are non-zero, the tens digit is a multiple of the hundreds digit, the units digit is a multiple of the tens digit, and none of the digits are the same?",
        "inference": "1. Digits are non-zero, so we have 9 choices for each digit.\n\n2. Tens digit is a multiple of the hundreds digit. We have 9 choices for the hundreds digit and 3 choices for the tens digit (multiples of the hundreds digit).\n\n3. Units digit is a multiple of the tens digit. We have 3 choices for the tens digit and 3 choices for the units digit (multiples of the tens digit).\n\n4. None of the digits are the same, so we have 9 * 3 * 3 * 8 = 648 different numbers.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{648}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the hundreds digit is $1,$ there are $3$ possible numbers for the tens digit: $2,$ $3,$ and $4.$ Any number greater than $4$ is impossible because the units digit must be a multiple of the tens digit. Therefore, we have $124,$ $126,$ $128,$ $136,$ $139,$ and $148.$\n\nIf the hundreds digit is $2,$ there is only $1$ possible number for the tens digit: $4$ because any number greater than $4$ would have a multiple that has two digits. Therefore, we have $248.$\n\nWe cannot have any number with a hundreds digit larger than $2$. Therefore, there are $6+1=\\boxed{7}$ possible numbers."
