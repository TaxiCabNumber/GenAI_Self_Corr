At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA water tank in the shape of a right circular cylinder has a base radius of $30$ meters and a volume of $2700\\pi$ cubic meters. What is the number of meters in the height of the tank?",
        "inference": "The volume of the tank is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the base radius and $h$ is the height.\n\nWe are given that $V = 2700\\pi$ and $r = 30$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n```\n2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h\n```\n\nSolving for $h$, we get:\n\n```\nh = \\frac{2700\\pi}{\\pi (30)^2} = 30\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$30$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the height measure $h$ meters.  By the formula for the area of a cylinder, which states that $V=\\pi r^2 h$ where $V, r, h$ denote volume, radius and height respectively, we have \\[2700\\pi = \\pi (30)^2 h.\\]Solving yields $h = \\boxed{3}$ meters."
