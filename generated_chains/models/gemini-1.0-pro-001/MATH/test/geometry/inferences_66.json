At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRhombus $ABCD$, with side length 6, is rolled to form a cylinder of volume 6 by taping $\\overline{AB}$ to $\\overline{DC}$.  What is $\\sin\\left(\\angle ABC\\right)$?",

        "ground_truth": "Let $\\theta = \\angle ABC$. The base of the cylinder is a circle with circumference 6, so the radius of the base is $6/(2\\pi)=3/\\pi$. The height of the cylinder is the altitude of the rhombus, which is $6\\sin \\theta$.
