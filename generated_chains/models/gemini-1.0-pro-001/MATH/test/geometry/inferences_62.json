I hope it is correct.'\nAn aquarium has a rectangular base that measures 100 cm by 40 cm and has a height of 50 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged. By how many centimeters does the water level rise?
