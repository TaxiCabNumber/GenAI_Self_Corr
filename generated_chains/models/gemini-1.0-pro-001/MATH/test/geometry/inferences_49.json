At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the rectangle with vertices at $(5,4),$ $(5,-4),$ $(-5,4),$ $(-5,-4)$. How many integer coordinates will be strictly inside the rectangular region?",

There will be 9 lattice positions between the two vertical sides of the rectangle. The height of the rectangle is $4 - (-4) = 8$ units. There will be 7 lattice positions between the top and bottom of the rectangle. That's a total of $9 \\times 7 = \\boxed{63}$ lattice points."
