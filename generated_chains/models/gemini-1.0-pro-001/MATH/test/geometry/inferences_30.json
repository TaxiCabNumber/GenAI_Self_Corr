        "inference": "The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the areas of the circular bases and the curved surface. The area of each circular base is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 36\\pi$ cm^2.

        "ground_truth": "The surface area of the solid can be split into four pieces:  the top and bottom, the curved side, and the flat side.\n\nThe top and bottom pieces are semicircles with radius 6; together, they add up to a circle with radius 6 and area $\\pi(6^2)=36\\pi$.\n\nThe curved side can be rolled out to a rectangle with height 10.  The width of this rectangle is half the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 6 = 6\\pi$.

The width of this rectangle is the diameter of the cylinder, which is $6\\cdot 2 = 12$.
