        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe intersection of the graphic solutions of all three inequalities listed below form an enclosed region in the coordinate plane.  What is the area of this region?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. \\[\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n(x-4)^2+y^2\\leq 16 \\\\\ny \\geq x-4 \\\\\ny\\geq -\\frac{1}{3}x\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]",
        "inference": "The first inequality is the equation of a circle with center at $(4, 0)$ and radius $4$. So it is a circle with area $\\pi \\cdot 4^2 = 16 \\pi$.\n\nThe second inequality is the equation of a line with slope $1$ and $y$-intercept $-4$. So it is a line passing through $(0, -4)$ and $(4, 0)$.\n\nThe third inequality is the equation of a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $y$-intercept $0$. So it is a line passing through $(0, 0)$ and $(3, -1)$.\n\nThe enclosed region is a triangle with vertices $(0, -4)$, $(4, 0)$, and $(3, -1)$. The base of the triangle is $4 - 0 = 4$, and the height of the triangle is $0 - (-4) = 4$. So the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\nThe area of the triangle is subtracted from the area of the circle to get the area of the enclosed region: $16\\pi - 8 = \\boxed{8(\\pi - 1)}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8(\\pi - 1)}$.
