        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo sides of scalene $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ measure $3$ centimeters and $5$ centimeters. How many different whole centimeter lengths are possible for the third side?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nLet $x$ be the length of the third side of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$. Then we know that $3<x<5$, since the triangle is scalene. The possible whole centimeter lengths for $x$ are the integers between $3$ and $5$, inclusive. Therefore, there are $5-3+1=\\boxed{3}$ possible whole centimeter lengths for the third side.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side of a triangle with sides $3\\text{ cm}$ and $5\\text{ cm}$ must be larger than $2\\text{ cm}$ but smaller than $8\\text{ cm}.$ If the third side must be a whole centimeter length, and the triangle is scalene, that means that the only possible lengths for the third side are: $4\\text{ cm},$ $6\\text{ cm},$ and $7\\text{ cm}.$ That makes $\\boxed{3}$ possible lengths for the third side."
