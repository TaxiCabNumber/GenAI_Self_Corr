At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDanny Henry made a waffle on his six-inch-diameter circular griddle using batter containing a half a cup of flour. Using the same batter, and knowing that all waffles have the same thickness, how many cups of flour would Paul Bunyan need for his 24-foot-diameter circular griddle?",
        "inference": "The area of a circle is given by $$ A = \\pi r^2 $$.\n\nIf Danny's griddle has a diameter of 6 inches, its radius is 3 inches, and its area is $$ A = \\pi (3)^2 = 9\\pi $$.\n\nIf Paul Bunyan's griddle has a diameter of 24 feet, its radius is 12 feet, or 144 inches, and its area is $$ A = \\pi (144)^2 = 20736\\pi $$.\n\nMultiplying the ratio of areas and the fraction of a cup of flour that Danny used gives the amount of four Paul Bunyan needs: $$ \\frac{20736\\pi}{9\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1152 $$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1152}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Say Paul and Danny's griddles have diameters $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively. Paul's griddle has $\\frac{d_1}{d_2}=\\frac{24\\text{ ft}}{.5\\text{ ft}}=48$ times the diameter and therefore $\\frac{\\pi d_1^2/4}{\\pi d_2^2/4}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=48^2=2304$ times the area. It requires $2304$ times as much flour, or $2304\\cdot0.5=\\boxed{1152}$ cups of flour."
