The area of a triangle is half the product of its base and height, and the area of a sector is the fraction of the area of the circle with the same radius determined by the central angle of the sector.

        "ground_truth": "The area of the shaded region equals the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle.  The area of the circle is $2^2\\pi=4\\pi$.  To find the area of the triangle, we look for information about the triangle.

What's more, since $AB=4$ and $BC=2$, it follows that $AC=2\\sqrt{3}$ and the area of right triangle $ACB$ equals $\\frac{2\\cdot2\\sqrt{3}}2=2\\sqrt{3}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $\\boxed{4\\pi - 2\\sqrt{3}}$."
