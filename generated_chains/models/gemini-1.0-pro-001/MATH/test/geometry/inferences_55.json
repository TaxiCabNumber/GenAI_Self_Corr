At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA star-polygon is drawn on a clock face by drawing a chord from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise from that number.  That is, chords are drawn from 12 to 5, from 5 to 10, from 10 to 3, and so on, ending back at 12.  What is the degree measure of the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon?",
        "inference": "1. A standard clock has 12 numbers, which form a regular 12-gon.\n2. If we draw chords from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise, we will create 12 isosceles triangles.\n3. Each triangle has two equal angles, and we know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\n4. Therefore, each of the equal angles in each triangle measures (180 - 120) / 2 = 30 degrees.\n5. Since the star-polygon is formed by connecting the vertices of these triangles, the angle at each vertex is equal to the sum of the equal angles in the adjacent triangles.\n6. Therefore, the angle at each vertex in the star-polygon is 30 + 30 = 60 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$60$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consider the two chords with an endpoint at 5. The arc subtended by the angle determined by these chords extends from 10 to 12, so the degree measure of the arc is $(2/12)(360)=60$.  By the Central Angle Theorem, the degree measure of this angle is $(1/2)(60)=30$. By symmetry, the degree measure of the angle at each vertex is $\\boxed{30}$."
