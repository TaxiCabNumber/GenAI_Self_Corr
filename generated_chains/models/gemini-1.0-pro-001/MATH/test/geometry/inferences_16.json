If $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are chosen to be any three of these points, then how many different possible values are there for $m\\angle PQR$?",
        "inference": "There are $\\boxed{6}$ different possible values for $m\\angle PQR$.\n\n**Step 1:** Since the points are equally spaced around a circle, each of the 7 arcs between consecutive points is $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the total circumference.\n\n**Step 2:** The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.\n\n**Step 3:** Therefore, if $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are chosen to be any three of these points, then the possible values for $m\\angle PQR$ are the following:\n\n* $\\frac{1}{7} \\times 180 = 25.71^\\circ$\n* $\\frac{2}{7} \\times 180 = 51.43^\\circ$\n* $\\frac{3}{7} \\times 180 = 77.14^\\circ$\n* $\\frac{4}{7} \\times 180 = 102.86^\\circ$\n* $\\frac{5}{7} \\times 180 = 128.57^\\circ$\n* $\\frac{6}{7} \\times 180 = 154.29^\\circ$\n\n**Final Answer:** $6$",
        "ground_truth": "The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that $m\\angle PQR$ is half the measure of arc $PR$. So the measure of angle $\\angle PQR$ depends only on the size of arc $PR$.  The seven given points are equally spaced around the circle, so they divide the circumference into seven congruent arcs.  Arc $PR$ could consist of one, two, three, four, or five of these pieces.  (Draw a few quick pictures if this is not immediately apparent; in particular, convince yourself that enclosing six pieces is not an option.)  Therefore there are only $\\boxed{5}$ different values for $m\\angle PQR$."
