        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA world-record swimmer and a dolphin compete in a 400-meter race. The swimmer swims at a rate of 2 meters per second, and the dolphin swims at a rate of 8 meters per second. When the dolphin crosses the finish line, how many meters is the swimmer from the finish line?",
        "inference": "The swimmer takes 200 seconds (400 meters / 2 meters per second) to finish the race. During this time, the dolphin swims 1600 meters (8 meters per second x 200 seconds). Therefore, when the dolphin crosses the finish line, the swimmer is 1600 meters - 400 meters = 1200 meters from the finish line.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1200}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The dolphin swims four times faster than the swimmer, so it covers four times the distance in a given time. So when the dolphin has swum 400 meters to get to the finish line, the swimmer has swum $400/4=100$ meters, and is thus $400-100=\\boxed{300}$ meters from the finish line."
