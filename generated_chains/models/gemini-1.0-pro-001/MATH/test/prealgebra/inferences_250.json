At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular garden has a length that is twice its width. The dimensions are increased so that the perimeter is doubled and the new shape is a square with an area of 3600 square feet. What was the area of the original garden, in square feet?",
