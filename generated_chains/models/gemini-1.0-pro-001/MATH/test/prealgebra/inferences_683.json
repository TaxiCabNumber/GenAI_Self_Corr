At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKailin's favorite restaurant has a special offer on a three-course meal. A meal consists of an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. The menu features five appetizers, eight entrees and four desserts. How many different three-course meals can be formed with these choices?",
        "inference": "The number of different three-course meals that can be formed is the product of the number of choices for each course. \n\nNumber of appetizers = 5\nNumber of entrees = 8\nNumber of desserts = 4\n\nTotal number of three-course meals = 5 x 8 x 4 = 160.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{160}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 choices for an appetizer, 8 choices for an entree, and 4 choices for a dessert.  In total, these three independent decisions can be made in $5\\times8\\times4=\\boxed{160}$ ways."
