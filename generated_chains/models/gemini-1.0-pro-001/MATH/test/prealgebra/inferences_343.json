        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circle is inscribed in a square with perimeter of 32 inches. What is the circumference of the circle, in inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "Since the perimeter of the square is 32 inches, each side of the square is 8 inches long. \nThe diameter of the circle is equal to the length of a side of the square, so the diameter of the circle is 8 inches. \nTherefore, the radius of the circle is 4 inches. \nThe circumference of the circle is given by the formula $C = \\pi d$, where $C$ is the circumference, $\\pi$ is a constant approximately equal to 3.14, and $d$ is the diameter. \nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get $C = \\pi (8) = 8\\pi$. \n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$C=8\\pi$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the square's side length.  The side length of the square is $(32\\text{ in.})/4=8$ inches. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\cdot(8\\text{ in.})=\\boxed{8\\pi}$ inches."
