        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a convex quadrilateral, the measure of the largest angle is twice the measure of the smallest angle, and the other two angles are both right angles. How many degrees are in the largest angle?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.\nLet's call the smallest angle x, then the largest angle is 2x.\nWe know that the other two angles are both right angles, which is 90 degrees each.\nSo, we have the equation:\nx + 2x + 90 + 90 = 360\nCombining like terms, we get:\n3x + 180 = 360\nSubtracting 180 from both sides, we get:\n3x = 180\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 60\nSo, the smallest angle is 60 degrees, and the largest angle is 2x = 120 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The interior angles of a quadrilateral must add up to 360.  (You can solve for this using the formula: $S = (n-2)(180)$, where S is the sum of the interior angles, and $n$ is the number of sides in the polygon.  However, if you want to get this problem quickly, you should have the value memorized.)  Since two of the angles are right, the other two angles must add up to 180.  Name the smaller angle $x$ - since the larger angle is double the smaller, we have $3x = 180 \\rightarrow x = 60$, and $2x = 120$.  Thus, there are $\\boxed{120}$ degrees in the larger angle."
