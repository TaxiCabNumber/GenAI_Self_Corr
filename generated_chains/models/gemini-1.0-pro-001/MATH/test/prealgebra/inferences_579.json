At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $2004$ is split after the third digit into a three-digit integer  and a one-digit integer, then the two integers, $200$ and $4$, have  a common factor greater than one.  The years $2005$ and $2006$  each have this same property, too.  What is the first    odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has this property?",

We could guess that no odd-numbered years will have this property.  To prove this by contradiction, assume that an odd number n has this property.  Then n can be written as 100a+b, where a and b are integers and 1<=b<=9.\n\n100a+b=200c+d, where c and d are integers and 1<=d<=9.\n\n100a+b=2(100c+d)\n\n50a+b=100c+2d\n\n50a+b=2(50c+d)\n\n50a+b-2(50c+d)=0\n\n50(a-2c)+b-2d=0\n\n50(a-2c) is divisible by 50.  If b-2d is divisible by 50, then n is divisible by 50, which is a contradiction, since n is odd.  If b-2d is not divisible by 50, then 50(a-2c) and b-2d have a greatest common factor of 1.  Because 50 and b-2d are both odd, a-2c must be even.  Since a is an integer, 2c must be even.  Since c is an integer, c must be even, which is a contradiction since c is odd because n is odd.\n\nTherefore, there is no odd-numbered year after 2006 that has this property.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{no  such year}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We note that $2013$ has the property: since the sum of the digits of 201, $2+0+1=3$, is divisible by $3$, $201$ is itself divisible by $3$. We must now check whether any odd-numbered years before $2013$ have the property. $200$ is not divisible by the prime $7$, so $2007$ does not have this property. Likewise, the sum of the digits of $200$ is $2$, which is not divisible by $3$, so $200$ and $9=3^2$ are relatively prime. Clearly $2011$ does not have the desired property since every natural number is relatively prime to $1$. Thus, the first odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has the desired property is $\\boxed{2013}$."
