At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the area, in square units, of a square whose sides are the same length as the radius of a circle with a circumference of $12\\pi$ units?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\nThe circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius. We are given that the circumference of the circle is $12\\pi$ units, so we have:\n\n$$12\\pi = 2\\pi r$$\n\nDividing both sides by $2\\pi$, we get:\n\n$$r = 6$$\n\nThe area of a square is given by $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. We are given that the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle, so we have:\n\n$$s = r = 6$$\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is:\n\n$$A = s^2 = 6^2 = 36$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{36}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "$C=2\\pi r$, so $12\\pi=2\\pi r$. Thus, $r=6$. The area of a square with side length 6 is $6^2=\\boxed{36} \\text{ sq units}$."
