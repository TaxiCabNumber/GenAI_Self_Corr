At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe radius of a circle is $x+6$ and its diameter is $3x+5$. What is the circumference of the circle, in terms of $\\pi$? (Do not include the variable $x$ in your answer.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe diameter of a circle is twice its radius, so we have $3x+5 = 2(x+6)$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 1$.\n\nThe circumference of a circle is given by $C = \\pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter. Therefore, the circumference of this circle is $C = \\pi (3x+5) = \\pi (3(1) + 5) = \\pi (8)$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$8\\pi$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the diameter of a circle is twice its radius, we know that $3x+5=2(x+6)$, or $3x+5=2x+12$. Subtracting $2x+5$ from both sides gives $x=7$. The circumference of a circle is $\\pi$ times its diameter, so the circumference is $(3x+5)\\pi=(3\\cdot7+5)\\pi=(21+5)\\pi=\\boxed{26\\pi}$."
