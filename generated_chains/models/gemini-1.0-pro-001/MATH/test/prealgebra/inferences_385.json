        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age.  Exactly half of the  adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female  adults have exactly one biological child.  Nobody else has a  child, and there are no other children.  What percent of the  people of Mathopolis are children?",
        "inference": "Let's start by defining some variables:\n\n* A = the total number of adults in Mathopolis\n* C = the total number of children in Mathopolis\n* F = the number of female adults in Mathopolis\n* M = the number of male adults in Mathopolis\n\nWe know that:\n\n* A = 2C (since exactly half of the adults have children)\n* F = A/2 (since exactly half of the adults are female)\n* F/2 = C (since exactly half of the female adults have children)\n\nSubstituting F = A/2 into the third equation, we get:\n\n* (A/2)/2 = C\n* A/4 = C\n\nSubstituting A = 2C into the first equation, we get:\n\n* 2C = 2C\n* C = 0\n\nThis means that there are no children in Mathopolis. Therefore, the percent of the people of Mathopolis who are children is 0%.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\\boxed{20}$ percent."
