At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn my ping-pong team there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys.  Of the students on the team who are left-handed, there are twice as many girls as there are boys.  Half of the girls who are on the team are left-handed.  If there are 36 people on the team, how many are right-handed boys? (Assume no player plays ping-pong equally well with both hands.)",
