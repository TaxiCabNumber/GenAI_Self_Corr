At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKarla drove her vehicle 12,000 miles last year. How many gallons of gasoline would she have saved last year had she driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon rather than an SUV averaging 15 miles per gallon?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the gallons of gasoline used by the SUV. \nGasoline used by SUV = Distance traveled by SUV / Mileage of SUV\n= 12,000 miles / 15 miles per gallon\n= 800 gallons\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the gallons of gasoline used by the hybrid car.\nGasoline used by hybrid car = Distance traveled / Mileage of hybrid car\n= 12,000 miles / 48 miles per gallon\n= 250 gallons\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the gallons of gasoline saved by driving the hybrid car.\nGasoline saved = Gasoline used by SUV - Gasoline used by hybrid car\n= 800 gallons - 250 gallons\n= 550 gallons\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{550}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Karla used $12000/15 = 800$ gallons to drive 12000 miles. Had she driven the hybrid, she would have used $12000/48 = 250$ gallons. Therefore, she would have saved $800 - 250 = \\boxed{550}$ gallons."
