At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaphne has a rope that is 60 meters long. She wants to use it to mark the boundary of a circle whose radius is an integer. What's the largest possible radius for her circle, in meters?",
        "inference": "1. The circumference of a circle is \\(2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. \n2. Since Daphne's rope is 60 meters long, we have:\n\n$$2\\pi r = 60$$\n\n3. Solving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\n$$r = \\frac{60}{2\\pi} \\approx 9.55$$\n\n4. Since the radius must be an integer, the largest possible radius is 9 meters.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The 60-meter rope will mark the circumference of the circle, which is equal to $2\\pi r$. So we look for the largest integer $r$ such that the circumference is less than or equal to 60. We have $$2\\pi r\\le60\\qquad\\implies r\\le\\frac{60}{2\\pi}\\approx \\frac{30}{3.14}.$$We know that $\\frac{30}{3.14}<\\frac{31.4}{3.14}=10$, but greater than $\\frac{31.4-3.14}{3.14}=9$, so the largest possible radius is $\\boxed{9}$ meters."
