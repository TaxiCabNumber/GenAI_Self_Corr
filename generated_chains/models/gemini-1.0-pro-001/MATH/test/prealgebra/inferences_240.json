        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA juice company sells its product in either a 48-ounce size or a 32-ounce size. It charges $\\$3.90$ for the 48-ounce size. How much should it charge for the smaller size if it wants the price per ounce to be $25\\%$ more than the price per ounce of the larger size?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the price per ounce of the 48-ounce size.**\n\nPrice per ounce = Total price / Number of ounces\n\nPrice per ounce = $3.90 / 48 ounces\n\nPrice per ounce = $0.08125\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the new price per ounce for the 32-ounce size.**\n\nNew price per ounce = Original price per ounce * (1 + 25%)\n\nNew price per ounce = $0.08125 * (1 + 0.25)\n\nNew price per ounce = $0.10156\n\n**Step 3: Find the price of the 32-ounce size.**\n\nPrice = New price per ounce * Number of ounces\n\nPrice = $0.10156 * 32 ounces\n\nPrice = $3.25\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3.25}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We could solve this problem by figuring out the per-ounce cost of the 48-ounce package, increasing it by $25\\%$, and then multiplying that by 32 for the smaller package. However, if we simply increase the price by $25\\%$, and then scale the package size down to 32 ounces from 48 ounces, these are the same calculations, but in a different order that makes it easier to calculate. Thus: $3.90 \\times 1.25 \\times \\frac{32}{48} = \\boxed{3.25\\text{ dollars}}$"
