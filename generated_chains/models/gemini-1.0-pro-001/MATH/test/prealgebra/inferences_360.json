At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 20 cars in my building's parking lot.  All of the cars are red or white.  Also, all the cars are either 2-door or 4-door.  12 of them are red, 15 of them are 4-door, and 4 of them are 2-door and white.  How many of the cars are 4-door and red?",
        "inference": "1. Let x be the number of 4-door red cars.\n2. We know that 12 of the cars are red, so we have x + (number of 2-door red cars) = 12.\n3. We also know that 15 of the cars are 4-door, so we have x + (number of 4-door white cars) = 15.\n4. We know that 4 of the cars are 2-door and white, so we have (number of 2-door red cars) + 4 = (number of 4-door white cars).\n5. Substituting the expression from step 4 into step 2, we get x + (x + 4 - 15) = 12.\n6. Simplifying, we get x = 12 - x - 4 + 15 = 13.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, the number of red 2-door cars is $12-x$, while the number of white 4-door cars is $15-x$.  The sum of the number of red 4-doors, red 2-doors, white 4-doors, and white 2-doors is the total number of cars (20), because each car is contained in exactly one of these categories.  Since the number of white 2-doors is 4, we have $x + (12 - x) + (15 - x) + 4 = 20$, which makes $x = \\boxed{11}$."
