At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy have $36$ apples that they plan to split among themselves in a ratio of $2:3:3:4$, respectively. How many apples will Betty and Cathy have together?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of parts in the ratio: $2+3+3+4=12$.\n\n**Step 2:** Divide the total number of apples by the total number of parts: $36/12=3$.\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the value from Step 2 by the number of parts for each person to find the number of apples each person gets:\n\n- Amy: $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ apples\n- Betty: $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ apples\n- Cathy: $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ apples\n- Daisy: $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$ apples\n\n**Step 4:** Add the number of apples Betty and Cathy will have: $9 + 9 = 18$ apples.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}$.

        "ground_truth": "The four girls are dividing the $36$ apples into $2+3+3+4 = 12$ equal parts. Thus, there are $\\frac{36}{12} = 3$ apples per part. Together, Betty and Cathy have $3+3 = 6$ parts, so they will have $3 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{18}$ apples."
