At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHadley scored 92, 73, 79, and 87 points on the first four tests of the quarter. There is one test remaining. What is the minimum number of points that Hadley must score on the final test in order to have a mean of 80 points for the five tests?",
        "inference": "1. Find the total points scored on the first four tests: 92 + 73 + 79 + 87 = 331.\n2. To have a mean of 80 points for the five tests, the total points scored on all five tests should be 80 * 5 = 400.\n3. Subtract the total points scored on the first four tests from the total points needed for a mean of 80: 400 - 331 = 69.\n4. Therefore, Hadley must score at least 69 points on the final test in order to have a mean of 80 points for the five tests.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$69$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If five scores have a mean of 80, then their sum is $80\\cdot5=400$.  Since the first four scores add up to 331, the fifth score must be at least $400-331=\\boxed{69}$."
