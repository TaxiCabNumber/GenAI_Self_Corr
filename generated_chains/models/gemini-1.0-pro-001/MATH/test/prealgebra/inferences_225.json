        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA $12^{\\prime \\prime}$-diameter pizza and a $16^{\\prime \\prime}$-diameter pizza are each cut into eight congruent slices. Jane ate three slices of the $12^{\\prime \\prime}$ pizza. Mark ate three slices of the $16^{\\prime \\prime}$ pizza. How many more square inches of pizza did Mark eat than Jane? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
