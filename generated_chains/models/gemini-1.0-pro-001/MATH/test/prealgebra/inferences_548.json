At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average American consumes 1483 pounds of candy in a lifetime. Assuming that 1 year $=$ 52 weeks and the average life-span is 75 years, how many pounds of candy per week does the average American consume? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "1.  First, find the total number of weeks in 75 years: 75 years x 52 weeks/year = 3900 weeks.\n\n2. Then, divide the total number of pounds of candy consumed in a lifetime by the total number of weeks: 1483 pounds / 3900 weeks = 0.3803 pounds per week.\n\n3. Finally, round the answer to the nearest hundredth: 0.3803 pounds per week \u2248 0.38 pounds per week.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.38$}. I hope it is correct.",
