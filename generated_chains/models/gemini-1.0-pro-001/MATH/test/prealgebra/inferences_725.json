        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf an integer ends in the digit $0$ and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, then how many of the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9$ necessarily divide it?",
        "inference": "The sum of the digits of the number is divisible by $3$ if and only if the number of digits whose sum is divisible by $3$ is at least one less than the total number of digits in the number.\nThe only digits whose sum is divisible by $3$ are $3$, $6$, and $9$.\nHence, the number must have at least one digit that is $3$, $6$, or $9$.\nThe only number that has exactly one digit that is $3$, $6$, or $9$ is $3$, so $3$ divides the number.\nThe only number that has exactly two digits that are $3$, $6$, or $9$ is $6$, so $6$ divides the number.\nThe number does not have any digits that are $3$, $6$, or $9$, so $9$ does not divide the number.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the integer ends in $0$, it is divisible by $2$ and $5$.  Because the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, the number is divisible by $3$, and we know that a number divisible by both $2$ and $3$ is also divisible by $6$.  If the number is $30$, however, then it is not divisible by $4$, $8$, or $9$.  So exactly $\\boxed{4}$ of the numbers in the original problem statement must divide it."
