        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle so that the six-digit number is divisible by 4? $$3\\:5\\:2\\:9 \\bigcirc 2$$",
        "inference": "The divisibility rule for 4 states that a six-digit number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.\n\nIn this case, the last two digits are 2, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, we can place any digit in the circle.\n\nThe greatest digit that can be placed in the circle is 9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using the divisibility rule for 4, the six-digit number will be divisible by 4 if the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4. Of the two-digit numbers ending in 2, only 12, 32, 52, 72, and 92 are divisible by 4. Thus the greatest digit is $\\boxed{9}$."
