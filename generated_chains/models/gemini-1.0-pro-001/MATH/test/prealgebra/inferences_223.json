At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe radius of a circle is 2 inches. When the radius is doubled, by how many square inches is the area increased?  Express your  answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "When the radius is doubled, the original radius, $r=2$, becomes $2r=4$. The formula for finding the area of a circle is $A=\\pi r^2$. So, the original area is $A=\\pi (2)^2$, and the new area is $A=\\pi (4)^2$. Subtracting the original area from the new area gives the increase in area:\n\n$$Increase\\ in\\ area=\\pi (4)^2-\\pi (2)^2$$\n\n$$=\\pi (16-4)$$\n\n$$=\\pi (12)$$\n\n$$=12\\pi\\ in^2$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12\\pi}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the original circle is $\\pi \\cdot 2^2=4\\pi$ square inches. After doubling the radius to $2\\cdot2=4$ inches, the area increases to $\\pi \\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$ square inches. So the increase is $16\\pi-4\\pi=\\boxed{12\\pi}$ square inches."
