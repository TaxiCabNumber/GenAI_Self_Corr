At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $n$ be the smallest composite number such that it can be written as the product of two positive integers that differ by 10.  How many distinct prime factors does $n$ have?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nIf $n$ is the product of two positive integers that differ by 10, then $n$ is divisible by two numbers that differ by 10. The only two positive integers that differ by 10 are 5 and 15. Since 15 is not prime, $n$ is divisible by 5.  \n\nSince $n$ is the smallest composite number that can be written as the product of two positive integers that differ by 10, $n$ must be the product of 5 and the smallest prime number that is greater than 5. The smallest prime number that is greater than 5 is 7. Therefore, $n = 5 \\times 7 = 35$.  \n\nSince 35 is a product of two primes, 5 and 7, it has two distinct prime factors. \n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$2$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The smallest pair of numbers that differ by 10 is 1 and 11; however, they multiply to 11 which is not composite.  We try the next pair up: 2 and 12, which multiply to 24 which is composite, so $n=24$. $24$ factors as $2^3 \\cdot 3$, so it has $\\boxed{2}$ prime factors: 2 and 3."
