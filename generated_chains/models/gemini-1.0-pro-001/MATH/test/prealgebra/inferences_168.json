        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnna has 7 peaches and Dana has 9 peaches. Both of them divide their peaches up into meals. Anna divides her 7 peaches into 20 meals of equal size. Dana divides his peaches evenly into meals of 0.36 peaches per meal. Who has larger meals?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nAnna's meals: 7 peaches / 20 meals = 0.35 peaches / meal\n\nDana's meals: 0.36 peaches / meal\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{Dana has larger meals.}}$**",
        "ground_truth": "Anna's meals are each $\\frac{7}{20}$ peaches. Converting this into a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 5. Doing so, we get \\[\\frac{7}{20} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 5}{20 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{35}{100} = 0.35\\]Because 0.35 < 0.36, $\\boxed{\\text{Dana}}$ has larger meals."
