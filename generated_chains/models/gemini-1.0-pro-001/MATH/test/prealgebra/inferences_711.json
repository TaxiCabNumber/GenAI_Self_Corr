At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo concentric circular regions have radii of 1 inch and 10 inches. What is the area, in square inches, outside the smaller region, but inside the larger region? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the area of the larger region $\\pi \\cdot 10^2 = 100 \\pi$\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the area of the smaller region $\\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi$\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract the area of the smaller region from the area of the larger region $100 \\pi - \\pi = 99 \\pi$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{99 \\pi}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the inner circle is $\\pi$. The area of the outer circle is $100\\pi$. Thus, subtracting $\\pi$ from $100\\pi$, we get $\\boxed{99\\pi \\text{ square inches}}$."
