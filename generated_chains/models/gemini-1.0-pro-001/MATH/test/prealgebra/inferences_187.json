        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo bicycle racers cross the starting line on a circular track at 12:15 PM. One cyclist takes $12$ minutes per lap, while the other completes a lap every $16$ minutes. Assuming their speeds remain constant, what is the next time they cross the starting line together?  Your answer should be in the form $h:m_1m_2,$ like 3:45.",
        "inference": "The first cyclist completes a lap in $12$ minutes, so in $60$ minutes, he completes $5$ laps.  The second cyclist completes a lap in $16$ minutes, so in $60$ minutes, he completes $3$ laps and $45$ seconds.  Therefore, in $60$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $5$ laps and $3$ laps and $45$ seconds, respectively.  In $120$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $10$ laps and $6$ laps and $30$ seconds, respectively.  In $180$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $15$ laps and $9$ laps and $45$ seconds, respectively.  In $240$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $20$ laps and $13$ laps, respectively.\n\nIn $300$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $25$ laps and $16$ laps and $30$ seconds, respectively.  In $360$ minutes, the two cyclists complete $30$ laps and $20$ laps, respectively.  \n\nSo, the next time they cross the starting line together is after completing $30$ laps.  Since the first cyclist completes a lap in $12$ minutes, it takes him $360$ minutes to complete $30$ laps.  Since the second cyclist completes a lap in $16$ minutes, it takes him $480$ minutes to complete $30$ laps.  Therefore, the next time they cross the starting line together is in $\\boxed{8:00}$ PM.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8:00}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We seek the least common multiple of $12$ minutes and $16$ minutes. This gives the amount of time that transpires until the two again cross the starting line together. $12=2^2\\cdot 3$ and $16=2^4$, so taking the highest power of each yields $LCM(12,16)=2^4\\cdot 3=48$ minutes, so that the desired time is $48$ minutes past $\\text{12:15 PM}$, or $\\boxed{\\text{1:03 PM}}$."
