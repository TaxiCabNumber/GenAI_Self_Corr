At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix witches and ten sorcerers are at an arcane mixer. The witches have decided to shake hands with each of the sorcerers. None of the witches bothered to shake each other's hands, since they are all good friends already, and the sorcerers all sort of hate each other and did not shake hands with other sorcerers. How many handshakes took place at the mixer?",

        "ground_truth": "The only handshakes at the arcane mixer were between the $6$ witches and $10$ sorcerers, so there were $6 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{60}$ handshakes at the mixer."
