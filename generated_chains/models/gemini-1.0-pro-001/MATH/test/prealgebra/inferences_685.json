At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest common factor of 99 and 100?",
        "inference": "The greatest common factor of 99 and 100 is the largest number that is a factor of both 99 and 100.\nTo find the greatest common factor, we can prime factorize 99 and 100:\n```\n99 = 3^2 * 11\n100 = 2^2 * 5^2\n```\nThe greatest common factor is the product of the common prime factors:\n```\nGCF = 3^2 = 9\n```\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
