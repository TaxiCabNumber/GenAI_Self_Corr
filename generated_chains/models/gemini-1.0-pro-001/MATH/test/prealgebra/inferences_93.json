In this case, we have:\n\n511, 532, 535, 540, 542, 542, 545, 550, 551, 553, 554, 557, 560, 562, 565\n\nSince there are 15 data points, the median is the average of the 7th and 8th values. Therefore, the median is (542 + 545) / 2 = 543.5.\n\n**2) Find the mode:**\n\nThe mode is the value that appears most often. In this case, the mode is 542, which appears twice.\n\n**3) Find the sum of the median and mode:**\n\nThe sum of the median and mode is:\n\n543.5 + 542 = 1085.5\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1085.5$}.
