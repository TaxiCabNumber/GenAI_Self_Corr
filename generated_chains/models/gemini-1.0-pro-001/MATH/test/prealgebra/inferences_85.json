At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of four circles has a radius of 4 inches. A larger circle has an area equal to the total area of the four smaller circles. What is the length of the radius, in inches, of the larger circle?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nThe area of a circle is given by $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe total area of the four smaller circles is \n\n$$4 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 4^2 = 64 \\pi.$$\n\nThe area of the larger circle is equal to the total area of the four smaller circles, so we have \n\n$$\\pi r^2 = 64 \\pi.$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get \n\n$$r^2 = 64.$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get \n\n$$r = 8.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the length of the radius of a circle is multiplied by a factor of $k$, then the area of the circle is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$.  Since the larger circle has area 4 times greater than that of each smaller circle, the length of its radius is 2 times greater.  Therefore, the length of its radius is $2\\times 4\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{8}$ inches."
