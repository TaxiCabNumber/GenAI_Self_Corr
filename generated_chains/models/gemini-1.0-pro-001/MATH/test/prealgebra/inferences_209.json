At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn Heidi's history class, the only grades that count toward the semester average are the $6$ tests she has already taken and the upcoming final exam. The final exam counts as two tests. Heidi has determined that if she earns $99$ points on the final she will have exactly a $90$-point average for the semester. On average, how many points has Heidi scored on each test prior to the final exam?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be Heidi's average score on the six tests she has already taken. \n\nThen, her total score on the six tests is $6x$. \n\nHer total score on the final exam will be $2 \\times 99 = 198$. \n\nSo her total score for the semester will be $6x + 198$. \n\nSince she needs a $90$-point average, her total score must be $90 \\times 8 = 720$. \n\nTherefore, we have the equation $6x + 198 = 720$. \n\nSolving for $x$, we get $6x = 522$, so $x = \\boxed{87}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{87}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Set the average for her previous exams to be $x$. The total amount of points including the final will be $6x+2 \\cdot 99$. The average is $\\frac{6x+2 \\cdot 99}{8}=90$. Then we solve for $x$. $$\\frac{6x+2 \\cdot 99}{8}=90 \\rightarrow 6x+198=720 \\rightarrow 6x=522 \\rightarrow x=\\boxed{87}.$$"
