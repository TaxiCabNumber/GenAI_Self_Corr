At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven the four digits 2, 4, 6, and 7, how many different positive two-digit integers can be formed using these digits if a digit can be repeated in an integer?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit cannot be repeated in an integer. This can be done using the permutation formula, which states that the number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!. In this case, we have n = 4 and r = 2, so the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit cannot be repeated in an integer is P(4, 2) = 4! / (4 - 2)! = 4! / 2! = 12.\n2. Next, we need to find the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit can be repeated in an integer. This can be done by considering each digit as a separate object. For example, the digit 2 can be used in the tens place or the units place, so there are two different ways to use the digit 2. Similarly, there are two different ways to use the digit 4, two different ways to use the digit 6, and two different ways to use the digit 7. Therefore, the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit can be repeated in an integer is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16.\n3. Finally, we need to subtract the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit cannot be repeated in an integer from the number of different two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit can be repeated in an integer to get the number of different positive two-digit integers that can be formed using the four digits if a digit can be repeated in an integer. This gives us 16 - 12 = 4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 choices for the first digit and also 4 choices for the second, since the first digit may be repeated. This gives a total of $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ integers possible."
