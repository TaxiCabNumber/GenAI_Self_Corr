I hope it is correct.'\nAmaretta's birthday is July 27, and her brother Enzo's birthday is September 3. Every year, Amaretta and Enzo celebrate by eating cake every day from Amaretta's birthday through Enzo's birthday (including both birthdays). If they did this for the first time in 2008, how many cake-eating days will they have observed by the end of 2016?",

In non-leap years, there are 31 days in July and 30 days in September, making 61 days for their celebrations. In leap years, there are 31 days in July and 30 days in September, making 62 days for their celebrations.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, there are 9 years that are not leap years, and 2 years that are leap years, for a total of 11 years.\nSo the total number of cake-eating days they will have observed by the end of 2016 is:\n$$9 \\times 61 + 2 \\times 62 = 549 + 124 = \\boxed{673}$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{673}.
