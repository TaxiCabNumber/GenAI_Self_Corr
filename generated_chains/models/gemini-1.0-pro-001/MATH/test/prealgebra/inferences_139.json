        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe exam grades of a pre-algebra class were arranged in a stem and leaf plot as illustrated. What is the arithmetic mean of the median and the mode of the given data?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ c | c c c ccc c c c}\n4&1&&&&&&&&\\\\\n5&2&&&&&&&&\\\\\n6&7&8&8&&&&&&\\\\\n7&1&1&2&3&3&3&5&6&8\\\\\n8&0&4&4&6&6&6&6&8&\\\\\n9&1&3&5&5&7&&&&\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** The median is the middle value of the data set when arranged in order from least to greatest. In this case, the data set is:\n\n41, 52, 67, 68, 68, 71, 71, 72, 73, 73, 75, 76, 76, 76, 76, 78, 80, 84, 84, 86, 86, 86, 86, 88, 91, 93, 95, 95, 97\n\nThe median is the average of the middle two values, which are 76 and 78. Therefore, the median is (76+78)/2 = 77.\n\n**Step 2:** The mode is the value that appears most often in the data set. In this case, 76 appears 4 times, which is more than any other value. Therefore, the mode is 76.\n\n**Step 3:** The arithmetic mean of the median and the mode is (77+76)/2 = 76.5.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{76.5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Each digit to the right of the vertical bar represents (the units digit of) one exam grade. Counting the digits, we see that there are $27$ exam grades in all. Thus, the $14^{\\rm th}$ grade in increasing order is the median (since there are $13$ grades smaller than it and $13$ grades larger than it). The chart makes it easy to read off the grades in increasing order -- we just read across the rows, from top to bottom. The $14^{\\rm th}$ entry is $78,$ so that's the median grade.\n\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring grade. In this case, it's $86,$ which appears four times in the chart.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the median and mode of the data is $\\dfrac{1}{2}(78+86),$ or $\\boxed{82}.$"
