Since angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary, we have:\n\n$$angle 1 + angle 2 = 180^\\circ$$\n\nSubstituting $angle 1 = 50^\\circ$ into this equation, we get:\n\n$$50^\\circ + angle 2 = 180^\\circ$$\n\nSolving for $angle 2$, we get:\n\n$$angle 2 = 180^\\circ - 50^\\circ = \\boxed{130^\\circ}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $130^\\circ$.
