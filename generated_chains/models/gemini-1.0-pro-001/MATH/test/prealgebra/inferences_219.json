At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a deck of $54$ cards, and I deal all of the cards to $x$ players, with each player getting $y$ cards. If $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least $5$, then how many possible values of $x$ are there?",
        "inference": "We can find the total number of cards dealt by multiplying the number of players by the number of cards each player gets: $xy$. Since we have a deck of $54$ cards, we can set this equal to $54$ and solve for $x$:\n\n$$xy = 54$$\n\nSince $y$ is at least $5$, the only possible values of $x$ are $2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We want $xy=54=2 \\cdot 3^3$ such that $x$ is at least $2$ and $y$ is at least  $5$. Thus, the possible combinations $(x,y)$ are $(2,27)$, $(3,18)$, $(6,9)$, and $(9,6)$. There are $\\boxed{4}$ such combinations."
