At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers $x$ satisfy $x-4<3$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe have that $x-4<3$ is equivalent to $x<3+4=7$. Therefore, all positive integers $x$ that satisfy $x-4<3$ are the positive integers $x$ such that $1\\le x<7$, which are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. There are $6$ such integers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Add 4 to both sides of the inequality to find $x<7$.  This inequality is satisfied by the $\\boxed{6}$ positive integers between 1 and 6 inclusive."
