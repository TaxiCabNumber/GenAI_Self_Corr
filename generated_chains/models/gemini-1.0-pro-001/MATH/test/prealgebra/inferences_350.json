        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer greater than 200 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 36 is 18?",
        "inference": "The greatest common divisor of 36 and 18 is 18.\nSo, the smallest integer greater than 200 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 36 is 18 is the smallest integer greater than 200 that is a multiple of 18.\nThe smallest multiple of 18 greater than 200 is 216.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{216}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factors of 36 are 2, 2, 3, and 3. If the greatest common factor with 36 is 18, that means the other number is a multiple of 18, containing the factors 2, 3, and 3 but not a second 2. The smallest multiple of 18 that is greater than 200 is $18(12)=216$, which does not work since the 12 contains a second 2. The next smallest multiple is $18(13)=234$, which does not contain a second 2. So, our answer is $\\boxed{234}$."
