At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFifty students were surveyed about their participation in hockey and baseball. The results of the survey were:\n\n$\\bullet$ $33$ students played hockey\n\n$\\bullet$ $24$ students played baseball\n\n$\\bullet$ $8$ students played neither hockey nor baseball\n\nHow many of the students surveyed played both hockey and baseball?",
