        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhile walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 19 miles north, then 16 miles west, then 3 miles south and finally 4 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
        "inference": "The traveler first traveled 19 miles north, so he is 19 miles away from the starting point in the north direction.\n\nThen, he traveled 16 miles west, so he is 16 miles away from the starting point in the west direction.\n\nNext, he traveled 3 miles south, so he is 3 miles away from the starting point in the south direction.\n\nFinally, he traveled 4 miles east, so he is 4 miles away from the starting point in the east direction.\n\nTo find the total distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n**Distance** = \u221a(19^2 + 16^2 + 3^2 + 4^2)\n\n**Distance** = \u221a(361 + 256 + 9 + 16)\n\n**Distance** = \u221a(642)\n\n**Distance** = 25.34 miles\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$25.34$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In total, the traveler went 16 miles north and 12 miles west. This forms a 12-16-20 (3-4-5) Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{20}$ miles away from the starting point."
