I hope it is correct.'\nEllen baked $2$ dozen cupcakes of which half contained chocolate, two-thirds contained raisins, one-fourth contained chocolate chips, and one-sixth contained nuts.  What is the largest possible number of cupcakes that had none of these ingredients?",
        "inference": "$2$ dozen is equal to $2\\times12=24$ cupcakes.\n\nHalf of them contain chocolate, so $12$ contain chocolate\n\nTwo-thirds contain raisins, so $\\frac{2}{3}\\times24=16$ contain raisins.\n\nOne-fourth contain chocolate chips, so $\\frac{1}{4}\\times24=6$ contain chocolate chips.\n\nOne-sixth contain nuts, so $\\frac{1}{6}\\times24=4$ contain nuts.\n\nThe largest number of cupcakes that have none of these ingredients is the total number minus the number with chocolate, the number with raisins, the number with chocolate chips, and the number with nuts.\n\n$24 - 12 - 16 - 6 - 4 = \\boxed{ -8}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that two-thirds of the cupcakes contained raisins, so at most $1/3\\cdot24=8$ cupcakes had none of the ingredients. This is possible if all cupcakes with chocolate, chocolate chips, and nuts were also raisin cupcakes (there are more raisin cupcakes than each of the other cupcake types). Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
