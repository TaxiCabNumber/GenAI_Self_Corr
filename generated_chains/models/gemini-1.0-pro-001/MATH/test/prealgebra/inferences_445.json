At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSix horses eat 12 bales of hay in 12 hours. At the same rate, how many hours will 36 bales of hay last 12 horses?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\n\nLet the time required be x hours\n\nThen,\n\n$\\frac{12 \\times 6 }{ 12} = \\frac{36 \\times 12 }{ x}$\n\n\u21d2  x = 24\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{24}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "From the original rate, we note that 12 horses will eat 12 bales of hay in 6 hours. (Double the number of horses, half the time)  Therefore, 12 horses will eat 36 bales of hay in $\\boxed{18\\text{ hours}}$. (Triple the amount of hay, triple the time)"
