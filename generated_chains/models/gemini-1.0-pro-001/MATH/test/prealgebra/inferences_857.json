At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the NBA in 2003, Yao Ming was one of the tallest players at $7'5''$. Earl Boykins was the shortest player at $5'5''$. How many inches taller than Boykins was Ming?",
        "inference": "1. Convert Yao Ming's height to inches: $7'5'' = 7 \\times 12 + 5 = 89$ inches.\n2. Convert Earl Boykins' height to inches: $5'5'' = 5 \\times 12 + 5 = 65$ inches.\n3. Subtract Boykins' height from Ming's height to find the difference in inches: $89 - 65 = 24$ inches.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The difference between $7'5''$ and $5'5''$ is exactly two feet.  Since there are twelve inches in one foot, two feet equal $2\\;\\cancel{\\text{feet}}\\times 12\\;\\dfrac{\\text{inches}}{\\cancel{\\text{foot}}} = \\boxed{24}$ inches."
