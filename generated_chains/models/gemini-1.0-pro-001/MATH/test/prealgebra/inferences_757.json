At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the composite numbers between 10 and 20 (not including 10 and 20)?",
        "inference": "The composite numbers between 10 and 20 (not including 10 and 20) are 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18. So, the sum of these numbers is 12 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 18 = 75.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{75}. I hope it is correct.",
