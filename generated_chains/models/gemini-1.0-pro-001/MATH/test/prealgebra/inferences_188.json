        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of Mary's age to Alice's  age is  $3:5$. Alice is 30 years old. How many years old is Mary?",
        "inference": "Let Mary's age be  $3x$ years.\nThen, Alice's age is  $5x$ years.\n\nGiven that Alice is  $30$ years old, we have:\n$$5x=30\\\\\\Rightarrow x=6$$\n\nTherefore, Mary's age is  $3x$:\n$$3x=3\\times6=18$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both parts of $3:5$ by 6 gives gives $3:5 = 3\\cdot 6:5\\cdot 6 = 18:30$. Therefore, if Alice is 30 years old, then Mary is $\\boxed{18}$ years old."
