At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of a rectangle is twice its width. Given the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}$, find the area of the rectangle.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the width of the rectangle be $x$.\n\nThen, the length of the rectangle is $2x$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, we have\n\n$$x^2 + (2x)^2 = (5\\sqrt{5})^2$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2 + 4x^2 = 125$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 5x^2 = 125$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2 = 25$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x = 5$$\n\nTherefore, the width of the rectangle is $5$ and the length of the rectangle is $2\\cdot5=10$.\n\nHence, the area of the rectangle is\n\n$$A = wl = 5\\cdot10 = \\boxed{50}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$50$}.

        "ground_truth": "Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$. We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to two sides of this rectangle and get that the length of the diagonal is $5\\sqrt{5}=\\sqrt{w^2+(2w)^2}=\\sqrt{5 w^2}$. We therefore have $5\\sqrt{5} = w\\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\\cdot10=\\boxed{50}$."
