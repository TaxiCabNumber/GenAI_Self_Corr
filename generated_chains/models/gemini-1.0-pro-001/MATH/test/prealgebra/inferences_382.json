At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree positive integers $a$, $b,$ and $x$ form an O'Hara triple $(a,b,x)$ if $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=x.$ For example, $(1,4,3)$ is an O'Hara triple because $\\sqrt{1}+\\sqrt{4}=3.$\n\nIf $(a,9,5)$ is an O'Hara triple, determine the value of $a.$",
