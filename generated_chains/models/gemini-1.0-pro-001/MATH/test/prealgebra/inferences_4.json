At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA housefly sits on the outer edge of a rotating circular ceiling fan with a diameter of 6 feet. The fan rotates constantly at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. How many minutes had the housefly been on the fan during the time it took to travel $19{,}404\\pi$ feet? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
