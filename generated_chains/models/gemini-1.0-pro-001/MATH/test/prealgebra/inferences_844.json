At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA watered circular field (shaded) is inscribed in a square plot of land. The square plot has sides of length 500 meters. What is the area of the land that is not watered? Express your answer to the nearest thousand square meters.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(10,10)--(0,10)--cycle,linewidth(1));\nfill(Circle((5,5),5),gray(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5),linewidth(1));\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "The area of the square is $500 \\times 500 = 250,000$ square meters.\nThe area of the circle is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi \\cdot 5^2 = 25 \\pi \\approx 78.54$ square meters.\nThe area of the land that is not watered is $250,000 - 78.54 \\approx 249, 921$ square meters.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$249,000$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area that is not watered is the area inside the square but outside the circle. The area of the square is $500\\cdot500=250000$ square meters. To find the area of the circle, we note that the diameter of the circle is equal to a side of the square, so the radius is $500/2=250$ meters. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi 250^2\\approx196300$ square meters. Thus, the unwatered region has area $250000-196300\\approx\\boxed{54000}$ square meters."

        "inference": "The error in the solution is that it incorrectly subtracts the area of the circle from the area of the square. The diagram shows that the unwatered area is the area of the square minus the area of the four triangles formed by the circle and the sides of the square.\n\nThe area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 12.5$ square meters. So the total area of the four triangles is $4 \\cdot 12.5 = 50$ square meters.\n\nTherefore, the area of the unwatered land is:\n\n$$250,000 - 50 = \\boxed{249,950}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$249, 950$}.**",
