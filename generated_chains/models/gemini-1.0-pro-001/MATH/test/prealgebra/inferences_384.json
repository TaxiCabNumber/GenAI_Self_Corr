At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $x$ is a multiple of 6 (not necessarily positive). If the square of $x$ is less than 200, how many possible values of $x$ are there?",
        "inference": "Since $x$ is a multiple of 6, it can be written as $x=6k$ for some integer $k$. We are given that $x^2<200$, so\n\n$$(6k)^2<200$$ $$36k^2<200$$ $$k^2<\\frac{200}{36}$$ $$k^2<5.56$$ \n\nSince $k$ is an integer, the largest possible value of $k$ is 2. Therefore, there are 3 possible values of $k$: 0, 1, and 2. This gives us 3 possible values of $x$:\n\n$$x=6(0)=0$$ $$x=6(1)=6$$ $$x=6(2)=12$$ \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The multiples $-12, -6, 0, 6,$ and 12 all have squares less than 200, for a total of $\\boxed{5}$ possible values. Since $18^2$ is bigger than 200, the squares of all the other multiples of $x$ are greater than 200. (Recall that the square of a negative number is positive)."
