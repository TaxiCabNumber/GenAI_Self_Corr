At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal at the grocery store, but the scales at the store only show weight in kilograms. If one kilogram is $2.20$ pounds, how many kilograms of veal should Alice buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest hundredth.)",
        "inference": "1. We need to convert $3$ pounds to kilograms using the conversion factor $1$ kilogram $=2.20$ pounds.\n>> $$3\\text{ pounds}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ kilogram}}{2.20\\text{ pounds}}\\approx 1.36\\text{ kilograms}$$\n\n>> $$3\\text{ pounds}\\times \\frac{100}{220}\\approx 1.36\\text{ kilograms}$$\n\n>> $$3\\text{ pounds}\\times \\frac{1}{2.20}\\approx 1.36\\text{ kilograms}$$\n\n2. Thus, Alice should buy about $1.36$ kilograms of veal.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1.36}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since Alice wants to buy $3$ pounds of veal, we multiply the quantity of $3$ pounds by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}}$ to obtain $3\\ \\text{lb} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{2.20\\ \\text{lb}} \\approx \\boxed{1.36}\\ \\text{kg}$."
