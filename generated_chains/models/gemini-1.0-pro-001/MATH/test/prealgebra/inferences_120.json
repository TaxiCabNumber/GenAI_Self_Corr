At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest number of marbles that could be divided up either into bags of $18$ marbles or into bags of $42$ marbles, with no marbles left over in each case?",

        "ground_truth": "The smallest number of marbles that can be broken up into bags of $18$ or bags of $42$ must be the least common multiple of both $18$ and $42$.  Factoring, $18 = 2\\cdot 3^2$ and $42 = 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7$.  The prime factorization of the least common multiple must include $2$, $3^2$, and $7$, and no other primes.  Thus, the answer is $2\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{126}$."
