        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe prime factorizations of 100 and 150 are:\n\n```\n100 = 2^2 * 5^2\n150 = 2 * 3 * 5^2\n```\n\nTherefore, the common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. To find the positive two-digit integers that are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to consider all possible combinations of these prime factors. The possible combinations are:\n\n```\n2\n2 * 5\n```\n\nThese two combinations correspond to the positive two-digit integers 2 and 10.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.**",
