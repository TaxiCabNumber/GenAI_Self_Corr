At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest two-digit prime that is the sum of three (not necessarily distinct) positive perfect cubes?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nThe only one-digit cubes are $1^3=1$ and $2^3=8$. The only two-digit cubes are $3^3=27$ and $4^3=64$. We need to find the smallest two-digit prime that is the sum of three of these cubes.\n\n$1+1+27=\\boxed{29}$\n$1+1+64=\\boxed{66}$\n$1+27+27=\\boxed{55}$\n$1+64+64=\\boxed{129}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{29}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by listing the smallest positive perfect cubes with two digits or fewer:\n\n1, 8, 27, 64.\n\nAnd now we sum them.  $1+1+1$ is too small; $1+1+8=10$ which is not prime; but $1+8+8=17$, which is indeed a prime.  Hence the answer is $\\boxed{17}$."
