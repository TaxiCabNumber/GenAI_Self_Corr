At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo-thirds of the students at Baker Middle School take music. There are 834 students who take music. How many students are there at Baker Middle School?",
        "inference": "Let's think step by step.\nLet x be the total number of students at Baker Middle School.  Then, two-thirds of the students take music, so 2/3x = 834 students.  Solving for x, we get x = 834 / (2/3) = 1251 students.\n\n\nFinal Answer:  $\\boxed{1251}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If there are $S$ students at Baker Middle School, then $\\frac{2}{3}S$ students take music.  Setting $\\frac{2}{3}S$ equal to 834 and multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{2}$, we find that there are $\\frac{3}{2}\\times 834=\\boxed{1251}$ students at the school."
