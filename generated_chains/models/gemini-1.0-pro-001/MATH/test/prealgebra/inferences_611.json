At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy club has 15 members.  In how many ways can we choose a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, if either the secretary or the treasurer must be elected vice-president and no other member can hold more than one office?",
        "inference": "In order for either the secretary or treasurer to be elected vice-president, it must first be determined which one of these two will be elected vice-president.  This can be done in $2$ ways.  Once it is decided which of these two is vice-president, the remaining person is the secretary or treasurer (whichever wasn't chosen as vice-president).  Thus, for a particular choice of vice-president, there is a total of $2$ ways to choose a secretary and treasurer.\n\nNow that the secretary and treasurer have been chosen, the remaining $12$ people can be chosen in $\\binom{12}{1}=12$ ways for president.  Therefore, for a particular choice of which of the two (secretary or treasurer) is vice-president, there is a total of $2\\cdot12=24$ ways to choose the president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.  Since there are $2$ ways to choose which of the two (secretary or treasurer) is vice-president, there are a total of $2\\cdot24=\\boxed{48}$ ways to choose these four officers.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{48}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 15 choices for president, 14 choices for secretary, 13 choices for treasurer, and 2 choices for vice-president, for a total of $15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 2 = \\boxed{5,\\!460}$ different choices."
