        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBill travels the 400 miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles at 50 mph. Sam travels the same distance at 40 mph. How many more hours than Bill did it take Sam to travel the 400 miles?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate Bill's travel time:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 400 miles / 50 mph = 8 hours\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate Sam's travel time:\nTime = Distance / Speed = 400 miles / 40 mph = 10 hours\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract Bill's time from Sam's time to find the difference:\nDifference in time = Sam's time - Bill's time = 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "At 50 mph, Bill will travel 400 miles in $\\frac{400}{50} = 8$ hours. Sam, on the other hand, traveling at 40 mph, will travel 400 miles in $\\frac{400}{40} = 10$ hours. Thus, it took Sam $\\boxed{2}$ more hours."
