At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe set $\\{5, 8, 10, 18, 19, 28, 30, x\\}$ has eight members. The mean of the set's members is 4.5 less than $x$. What is the value of $x$ ?",

So, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{5+8+10+18+19+28+30+x}{8} = x-4.5$$\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{118+x}{8} = x-4.5$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 8, we get:\n\n$$118+x = 8x-36$$\n\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$118 = 7x-36$$\n\nAdding 36 to both sides, we get:\n\n$$154 = 7x$$\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\n$$x = 22$$\n\nHence, $x$ is equal to 22.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{22}$.
