At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA hot air balloon is 10 feet off the ground and is rising at a constant rate of 2 feet per second. What is the height of the balloon, in feet, after 25 more seconds?",
        "inference": "- The balloon is initially 10 feet off the ground.\n- It is rising at a constant rate of 2 feet per second.\n- After 25 more seconds, it will have risen an additional 25 x 2 = 50 feet.\n- So, the total height of the balloon after 25 more seconds will be 10 + 50 = 60 feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "During these 25 seconds, the balloon will rise $2\\cdot25=50$ feet. The total height is then $10+50=\\boxed{60}$ feet."
