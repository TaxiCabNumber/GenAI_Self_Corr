        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers between 100 and 500 have at least two 3s as digits?",
        "inference": "There are 400 integers between 100 and 500.\n\nIf a number has at least two 3s, then it must have either two 3s in the tens and units digits, or a 3 in the hundreds digit and at least one 3 in the tens or units digits.\n\nThere are 10 ways to choose the tens digit (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and 10 ways to choose the units digit (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\nFor the case with two 3s in the tens and units digits, there are 10 * 10 = 100 such numbers.\n\nFor the case with a 3 in the hundreds digit and at least one 3 in the tens or units digits, there are 10 * 10 * 2 + 10 * 10 + 10 = 310 such numbers.\n\nCombining these cases, there are 100 + 310 = 410 integers between 100 and 500 that have at least two 3s as digits. However, we have counted the number 333 twice, so we need to subtract 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 410 - 1 = 409.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{409}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First consider the two $3$s to appear in the units and tens places. Between $100$ and $500$, there are four such numbers: $133$, $233$, $333$, and $433$. Now consider the two $3$s to appear in the units and hundreds places. The numbers will be in the $300$s, so we don't need to worry about if they are between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the tens digit, but we have already counted $333$, so such a scenario will add nine numbers. Finally, consider the two $3$s to appear in the tens and hundreds places. Again, these numbers are automatically between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the units digit, but we again discard $333$ for a final count of nine such numbers. Thus, our answer is $4+9+9 = \\boxed{22}$."
