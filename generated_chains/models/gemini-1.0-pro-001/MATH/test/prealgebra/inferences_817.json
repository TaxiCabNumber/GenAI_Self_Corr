At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the median and the mean of the set of numbers 12, 21, 6, 11 and 30?",
        "inference": "1. **Median:** The median is the middle value of a set of numbers when listed in ascending order. In this case, the numbers are 6, 11, 12, 21, and 30. The median is 12.\n2. **Mean:** The mean is the average of a set of numbers. To find the mean, add up all the numbers and then divide by the total number of numbers. In this case, the sum of the numbers is 12 + 21 + 6 + 11 + 30 = 80. There are 5 numbers in the set, so the mean is 80 / 5 = 16.\n3. **Sum of the median and the mean:** The sum of the median and the mean is 12 + 16 = 28.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$28$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In order, the numbers are 6, 11, 12, 21, and 30, so the median is 12. The mean is $(6 + 11 + 12 + 21 + 30)/5 = 80/5 = 16$. The sum of these two numbers is $\\boxed{28}$."
