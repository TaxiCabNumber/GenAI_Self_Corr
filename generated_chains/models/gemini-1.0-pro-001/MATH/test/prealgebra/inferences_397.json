At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nJamie spends $c + 3(c+2) = 4c + 6.$  Kevin spends $5c.$  So, they spend a total of  $4c + 6 + 5c = 9c + 6.$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{9c + 6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since each chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars, each vanilla bar costs $c+2$ dollars. Jamie spends $c+3(c+2)$ dollars, and Kevin spends $5c$ dollars. Their total, in dollars, is thus \\[c+3(c+2)+5c=c+3c+6+5c=\\boxed{9c+6}.\\]"
