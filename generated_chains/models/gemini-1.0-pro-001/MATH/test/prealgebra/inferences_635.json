At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe table shows the number of days per week households eat their dinner together.  What percent of households eat their dinner together at least once a week? \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{2}{c}{}\\\\\\hline\n7 days&40\\%\\\\\\hline\n5-6 days&30\\%\\\\\\hline\n1-4 days&20\\%\\\\\\hline\n0 days&10\\%\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",

Multiply the decimal by the number of households in each category:\n7 days: 0.4 * 100 = 40 households\n5-6 days: 0.3 * 100 = 30 households\n1-4 days: 0.2 * 100 = 20 households\n0 days: 0.1 * 100 = 10 households\n\n3. Add the number of households in each category:\n40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 100 households\n\n4. Divide the number of households who eat dinner together at least once a week by the total number of households:\n(40 + 30 + 20) / 100 = 90 / 100 = 0.9\n\n5. Convert the decimal to a percentage:\n0.9 * 100 = 90%\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{90}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only group of households who do not eat dinner at least once a week together is the $0$ days category, which accounts for $10$ percent. Thus, $\\boxed{90}$ percent of households eat dinner together at least once a week."
