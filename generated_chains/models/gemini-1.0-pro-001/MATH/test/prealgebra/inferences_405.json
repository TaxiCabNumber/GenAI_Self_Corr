        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the square root of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 2 units, what is the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides?",
        "inference": "Let's call the length of the hypotenuse $c$, and the lengths of the other two sides $a$ and $b$.\n\nWe know that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ (Pythagorean theorem).\n\nWe also know that $c = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$2^2 * 2 = a^2 + b^2$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$8 = a^2 + b^2$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$8$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $c$ represent the length of the hypotenuse. We're told that $\\sqrt{c}=2$, so $c=4$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the sum of the squares of the length of the two other sides equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($a^2+b^2=c^2$), so our answer is $c^2=\\boxed{16}$."
