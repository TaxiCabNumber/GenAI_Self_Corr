A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nThe number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 2 if and only if the digit $A$ is even, so the largest possible digit $A$ is 8.  The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits, which is $2A + 2B + C$, is divisible by 3.\n\nThe largest possible digit $B$ is 9, and if $A = 8$, then $2A + 2B + C = C + 34$.
