At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKelly can read five pages of her fiction book or two pages of her history textbook in seven minutes. If Kelly wants to read thirty pages of each book, for how many minutes in total must Kelly read?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the time it takes for Kelly to read one page of each book.\nTime to read one page of fiction book: 7 minutes / 5 pages = 1.4 minutes/page\nTime to read one page of history textbook: 7 minutes / 2 pages = 3.5 minutes/page\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total time to read 30 pages of each book.\nTime to read 30 pages of fiction book: 30 pages x 1.4 minutes/page = 42 minutes\nTime to read 30 pages of history textbook: 30 pages x 3.5 minutes/page = 105 minutes\n\n**Step 3:** Add the time for each book to find the total time required.\nTotal time to read 30 pages each: 42 minutes + 105 minutes = 147 minutes\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{$147$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Thirty pages of a fiction book is six sets of five pages, so it will take $6\\times 7 = 42$ minutes to read the fiction book. Likewise, thirty pages of a history textbook is fifteen sets of two pages, so it will take $15\\times 7 = 105$ minutes to read the history textbook. In total, this will be $42+105 = \\boxed{147}$ minutes."
