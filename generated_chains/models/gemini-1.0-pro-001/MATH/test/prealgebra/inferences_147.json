At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lengths of two opposite sides of a square are decreased by $40\\%$ while the lengths of the other two sides are increased by $50\\%$ to form a rectangle. By what percent does the square's area decrease?",
        "inference": "Let a be the original side length of the square. Then, after the changes, the lengths of two opposite sides become $0.6a$, while the lengths of the other two sides become $1.5a$.\n\nThe area of the original square is $a^2$, while the area of the new rectangle is $0.6a \\times 1.5a = 0.9a^2$.\n\nTherefore, the area decreases by $100\\% \\times \\frac{a^2 - 0.9a^2}{a^2} = 100\\% \\times 0.1 = \\boxed{10}$%.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $A$ be the area of the square. The lengths of one pair of opposite sides was decreased by $40\\%$, so the area became $.6A$. The other pair of sides were increased by $50\\%$, so the area became $1.5\\cdot .6 A = .9A$. Thus, the area decreased by $\\boxed{10}$ percent."
