At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEnrico makes a list of the first twenty positive multiples of 3. Marie makes a list of the first ten positive multiples of 6. How many of the numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list?",
        "inference": "The first twenty multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60.\n\nThe first ten multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60.\n\nThe numbers that are on both lists are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 numbers on Marie's list that are also on Enrico's list.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Enrico's list includes all the multiples of 3 from $1 \\cdot 3 = 3$ through $20 \\cdot 3 = 60$. Marie's list includes all the multiples of 6 from $1 \\cdot 6 = 6$ through $10 \\cdot 6 = 60$. Since 6 is a multiple of 3, any multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3. All of the numbers on Marie's list are multiples of 3 within the range of Enrico's list, so all $\\boxed{10}$ numbers on Marie's list are also on Enrico's list."
