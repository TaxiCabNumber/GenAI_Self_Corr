At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nStacey is standing in a field. She walks 11 meters west, 30 meters north, 4 meters west and finally 22 meters south. How many meters is she from her starting point?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Draw a diagram to represent Stacey's path.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total distance travelled in the west direction: $11 + 4 = 15$ meters\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the total distance travelled in the north direction: $30$ meters\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the total distance travelled in the south direction: $22$ meters\n\n**Step 5:** Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse, which represents the distance from the starting point:\n\n```\nDistance from starting point = sqrt((15 meters)^2 + (30 meters - 22 meters)^2)\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Simplify the expression and evaluate the square root:\n\n```\nDistance from starting point = sqrt(15^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(225 + 64) = sqrt(289) = 17 meters\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.**",
