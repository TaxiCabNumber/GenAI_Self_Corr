        "inference": "The positive integers smaller than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nThe prime factorization of each of these numbers is:\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2*3\n7 = 7\n\nTo find the least common multiple, we multiply together the highest power of each unique prime factor that appears in any of the prime factorizations. In this case, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 7, and the highest powers are 2^2, 3^1, 5^1, and 7^1.\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is\n2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 * 7^1 = 4 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 420.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{420}.
