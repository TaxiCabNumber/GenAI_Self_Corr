At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThirty-five students attend a math club meeting. The number of girls at the meeting is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys attending the meeting. How many boys are at the meeting?",
        "inference": "Since there are more girls than boys at the meeting, there are 14 girls and 21 boys.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$21$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We assume the number of girls is a nonnegative integer and no greater than 35. The nonnegative multiples of 13 less than 35 are 0, 13 and 26. As the number of girls is greater than the number of boys, the only valid choice is for there to be 26 girls. That leaves $35-26 = \\boxed{9}$ boys at the meeting."
