At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe shape of the sign outside Bob's Burger Barn is a regular octagon. How many degrees are in the measure of an interior angle of this sign?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a regular octagon is (8-2) * 180 = 1080 degrees. Since there are 8 interior angles, each interior angle measures 1080 / 8 = 135 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{135}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the octagon's angles is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1080^\\circ}{8} = \\boxed{135^\\circ}$."
