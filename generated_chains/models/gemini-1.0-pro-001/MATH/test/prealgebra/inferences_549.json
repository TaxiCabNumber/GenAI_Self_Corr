At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne day, 45 frogs were captured from a pond, marked and then returned to the pond. The next day, 40 frogs were observed in the pond, of which 10 had been marked the previous day. Assuming the marked frogs are equally distributed among all the frogs in the pond, what is the best estimate of how many frogs live in the pond?",
        "inference": "Let the total number of frogs in the pond be x.\nThen, the ratio of marked frogs to total frogs is 10/40 = 1/4.\nSince the marked frogs are equally distributed among all the frogs in the pond, we have:\n1/4 = 45/x\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 45 * 4 = 180\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{180}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The marked frogs comprised $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the $40$ observed frogs, so we can estimate that the number of frogs that were captured and marked are one fourth of the total number of frogs. Thus, the total number of frogs can be estimated as $45 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{180}$."
