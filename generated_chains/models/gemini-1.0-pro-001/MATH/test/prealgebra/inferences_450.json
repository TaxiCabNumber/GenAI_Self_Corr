At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 16 tablespoons in a cup. A recipe for 4 people uses 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. How many cups of garlic powder does it take to make the same recipe for 80 people? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
        "inference": "1 tablespoon of garlic powder is needed for 4 people. So, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder is needed for 1 person.\nFor 80 people, we need 80 x 1 = 80 tablespoons of garlic powder.\n16 tablespoons of garlic powder is equal to 1 cup. So, 80 tablespoons of garlic powder is equal to 80/16 = 5 cups.\nTherefore, the answer is 5 cups.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Our ratio of garlic powder to people served is $\\frac{1 \\textnormal{ tablespoon}}{4 \\textnormal{ people}}$. We multiply this ratio by 80 people to get the number of tablespoons needed to serve 80 people, which is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 80 = 20$ tablespoons. Converting this to cups, we have $20 \\textnormal{ tablespoons} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ cup}}{16 \\textnormal{ tablespoons}} = \\boxed{1\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups."
