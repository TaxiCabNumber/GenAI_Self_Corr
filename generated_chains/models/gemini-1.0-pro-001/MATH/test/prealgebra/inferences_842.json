        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 2.5 hours to seconds: 2.5 hours = 2.5 \u00d7 3600 seconds = 9000 seconds\n2. Let the length of the hallway be x meters.\n3. Since the robot traveled 1 kilometer in 9000 seconds, the robot traveled 1000 meters in 9000 seconds.\n4. The robot's speed is therefore 1000 meters / 9000 seconds = 1 / 9 meters per second.\n5. Therefore, the time it takes the robot to travel the length of the hallway (x meters) is x meters / (1 / 9 meters per second) = 9x seconds.\n6. Since the robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway, we have: 9x = 90\n7. Solving for x, we get: x = 90 / 9 = 10 meters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We see that 2.5 hours is the same as $2.5\\cdot 60 = 150$ minutes, or $150\\cdot 60 = 9000$ seconds.  This is 100 times longer than the robot was traveling the hallway, meaning the hallway is $\\frac{1}{100}$ kilometers, or $\\frac{1000}{100} = \\boxed{10}$ meters long."
