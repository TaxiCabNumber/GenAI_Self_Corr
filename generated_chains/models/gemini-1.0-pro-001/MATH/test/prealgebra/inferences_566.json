At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe arithmetic mean of 7, 2, $x$ and 10 is 9.

So, we have:\n$$\\frac{7+2+x+10}{4}=9$$\nSimplifying:\n$$\\frac{19+x}{4}=9$$\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n$$19+x=36$$\nSubtracting 19 from both sides:\n$$x=\\boxed{17}$$ \nFinal Answer: $$\\boxed{17}.$$ I hope it is correct.",
