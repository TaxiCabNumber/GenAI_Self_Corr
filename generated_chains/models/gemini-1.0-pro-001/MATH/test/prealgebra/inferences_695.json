At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDawn has $\\$ $1.20 in nickels, dimes and quarters. For each nickel she has one dime and for each dime she has one quarter. How many total coins does she have?",
        "inference": "Let $n$ be the number of nickels. \n\nDawn has $n$ dimes and $n$ quarters. \n\nThe total number of coins is $n+n+n=3n$. \n\nSince we know that Dawn has $\\$ $1.20 in nickels, dimes and quarters, we can write an equation: \n\n$$0.05n+0.10n+0.25n=1.20$$\n\nSolving for $n$, we get:\n\n$$n=8$$\n\nSo Dawn has $8$ nickels, $8$ dimes and $8$ quarters. \n\nThe total number of coins is $3n=3\\times8 = 24$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Dawn has $x$ nickels, then she has $x$ dimes and $x$ quarters. In cents, we set up an equation for how much money she has. \\begin{align*}\n5x+10x+25x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n40x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=3\n\\end{align*} She has $3$ of each coin for a total of $\\boxed{9}$ coins."
