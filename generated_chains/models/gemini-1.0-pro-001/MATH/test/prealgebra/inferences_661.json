At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn equilateral triangle has a side of length 12 inches. What is the area of the triangle, in square inches? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The area of an equilateral triangle is given by:\n$$A=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2$$\nwhere a is the length of one side.\nSubstituting a=12, we get:\n$$A=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(12)^2$$\n$$A=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(144)$$\n$$A=36\\sqrt{3}$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$. We have $s = 12$, so our area is $12^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = \\boxed{36\\sqrt{3}}$."
