At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a triangle have the same area. If the square has a side length of 6 units and the triangle has a base of 8 units, what is the length, in units, of the altitude to that base of the triangle?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the area of the square.**\n\nArea = side length^2 = 6^2 = 36 square units\n\n**Step 2: Since the square and triangle have the same area, the area of the triangle is 36 square units.**\n\n**Step 3: Find the formula for the area of a triangle.**\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * altitude\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula and solve for the altitude.**\n\n36 = (1/2) * 8 * altitude\n72 = 8 * altitude\naltitude = 9 units\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$9$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the square is $6^2=36$ square units, which is also the area of the triangle. Since the area of the triangle is half the product of the base and the height, the height of triangle is $36/8\\cdot2=\\boxed{9}$ units."
