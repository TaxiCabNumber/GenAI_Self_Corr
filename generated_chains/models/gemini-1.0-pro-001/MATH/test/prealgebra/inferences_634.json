At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we have 2 fair 6-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6.  If we roll them both, what is the probability that the two numbers shown sum to 7?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two 6-sided dice.\nThe outcomes that sum to 7 are: \n- (1,6)\n- (2,5)\n- (3,4)\n- (4,3)\n- (5,2)\n- (6,1)\n\nSo, there are 6 favourable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is:\n\n$$P=\\frac{6}{36}=\\frac{1}{6}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\).

        "ground_truth": "There are 6 equally likely outcomes for each die, so there are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ total equally likely outcomes for both dice together. The outcomes which sum to 7 are: 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, and 6 + 1, for a total of 6 equally likely successful outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is $\\frac{6}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
