At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a bag with 20 marbles, five of them are blue. How many blue marbles must be added to the bag so that the probability of selecting a blue marble at random is $\\frac{1}{2}$?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of blue marbles to be added. The probability of selecting a blue marble after adding \\(x\\) blue marbles is\n$$\\frac{5+x}{20+x}$$\n\nSetting this equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ gives\n$$\\begin{split} \\frac{5+x}{20+x} & = \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\ 2(5+x) & = 20+x \\\\\\ x & = 5 \\end{split}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we add $x$ blue marbles, then the fraction of blue marbles in the bag will be $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}$. We want this to equal $1/2$, so $\\frac{5 + x}{20 + x}= \\frac{1}{2}$. Clearing the fractions, we have $10 + 2x = 20 + x$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\boxed{10}$."
