At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$?",
        "inference": "The repeating block in the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $142857$. So the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit to the right of the decimal point is the $7^{\\text{th}}$ digit in the repeating block. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{142857}$, which repeats every six digits. Since 2007 divided by 6 has a remainder of 3, the $2007^{\\text{th}}$ digit is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, which is $\\boxed{2}$."
