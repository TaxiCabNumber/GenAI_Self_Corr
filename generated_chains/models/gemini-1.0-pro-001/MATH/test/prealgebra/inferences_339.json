At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the positive integers that are solutions of $-3n +3 >-11?$",
        "inference": "$-3n + 3 > -11$\n$\\Rightarrow -3n > -14$\n$\\Rightarrow n < \\frac{14}{3}$\nThe positive integers that are solutions are $1, 2, 3, 4$.\nTheir sum is $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Adding $3n+11$ to both sides, we get $$-3n+3+3n+11 > -11+3n+11,$$ which simplifies to $$14 > 3n.$$ Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $$4\\frac 23 > n.$$ The integer solutions are $n=1,2,3,4$, and their sum is $\\boxed{10}$."
