        "inference": "- At $2\\!:\\!48$, the minute hand is $48$ minutes past $2$, which is $48/60$ of the way around the clock.  $48/60 = 4/5$.\n- Therefore, the minute hand has moved $4/5$ of the way around the clock, or $4/5 \\cdot 360^\\circ = 288^\\circ$.\n- The hour hand is $2$ hours past $2$, which is $2/12$ of the way around the clock.  $2/12 = 1/6$.\n- Therefore, the hour hand has moved $1/6$ of the way around the clock, or $1/6 \\cdot 360^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.\n- The angle between the hour and minute hands is the difference between the two angles, which is $288^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 228^\\circ$.\n- Therefore, the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a $12$-hour clock at $2\\!:\\!48$ is $\\boxed{228^\\circ}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{228^\\circ}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=6^\\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\\cdot6^\\circ=288^\\circ$.\n\nThe hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\\frac{360^\\circ}{12}=30^\\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\\frac{48}{60}=\\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot30^\\circ=84^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\\circ-84^\\circ=204^\\circ$ and subtract from $360^\\circ$ to get $\\boxed{156^\\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\\circ+360^\\circ=444^\\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\\circ-288^\\circ=\\boxed{156^\\circ}$ to find the smaller angle."
