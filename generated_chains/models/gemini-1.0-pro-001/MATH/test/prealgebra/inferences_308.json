At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct diagonals of a convex pentagon can be drawn?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex is $n-3$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. In this case, $n=5$, so the number of diagonals that can be drawn from one vertex is $5-3=2$. Since there are $5$ vertices, the total number of diagonals is $5\\cdot2=\\boxed{10}$.\n**Final Answer: $$10$$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\\frac{10}{2} =\\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon."
