        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA convex pentagon has three right angles. The other two angles are congruent to each other. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of these other angles?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees. Since three of the angles are right angles, which means they measure 90 degrees each, their sum is 3 * 90 = 270 degrees. This means that the sum of the other two angles is 540 - 270 = 270 degrees. Since the two angles are congruent, each of them measures 270 / 2 = 135 degrees.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{135}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon measures $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  The five angles of a pentagon sum to 540 degrees, so if a pentagon has three right angles and two other angles each of which measures $x$ degrees, then  \\[\n3\\cdot90+2x=540.\n\\] Solving, we find $x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
