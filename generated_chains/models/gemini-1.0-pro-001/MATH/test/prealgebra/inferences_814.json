At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA domino consists of two congruent squares placed side by side. The perimeter of the domino is 60 units. What is the area of the domino, in square units?",
        "inference": "Let's assume the length of side of each square is x units. Perimeter of the rectangular part of the domino (excluding the two squares) = (2x + 2x) units = 4x units. Since the perimeter of the domino is 60 units, we have 4x + 2x(4) = 60. 4x = 20. x = 5. Area of each square = x^2 = 5^2 = 25 square units. Area of the domino = 2(Area of one square) = 2(25) = 50 square units.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{50}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that the domino's short side measures $l$ units.  Then it's long side measures $2l$ units, and the domino's total perimeter is $6l = 60$.  Thus $l = 10$ and the domino's area is $10\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{200}$ square units."
