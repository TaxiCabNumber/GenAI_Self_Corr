At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe circumference of Earth is 40,000 kilometers. How many trips around Earth could you take if you travel one billion meters?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the circumference of Earth from kilometers to meters: 40,000 km x 1,000 m/km = 40,000,000 m.\n2. Divide the distance you want to travel (one billion meters) by the circumference of Earth in meters: 1,000,000,000 m / 40,000,000 m = 25.\n3. Therefore, you could take 25 trips around Earth.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{25}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, convert one billion meters to kilometers.\n\n\\[1000000000 \\textnormal{ meters} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\textnormal{ kilometer}}{1000 \\textnormal { meters}} = 1000000 \\textnormal{ kilometers}\\]\n\nNext, we divide the total distance traveled by the circumference around the Earth to get the total number of trips around the world, or $\\frac{1000000}{40000} = \\boxed{25}$ trips."
