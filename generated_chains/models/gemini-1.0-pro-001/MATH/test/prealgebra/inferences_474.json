        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt is a beautiful day at the beach and ten beach volleyball players have shown up at the volleyball courts. Each two-person volleyball team should consist of a setter and a spiker. Five of the players prefer to be a spiker, four of the players prefer to be a setter, and one player is fine either way.\n\nIn how many ways can a two-person team be assembled such that no player feels out of position?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe start with the five spikers.  For each spiker, we can choose one of four setters to form a team.  This gives us $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ teams.\n\nNext, we consider the five setters.  For each setter, we can choose one of five spikers to form a team.  This gives us $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ teams.\n\nFinally, we have the one player who is fine either way.  This player can form a team with any of the other nine players, which gives us $1 \\cdot 9 = 9$ teams.\n\nAdding these three numbers together gives us $20 + 25 + 9 = 54$ teams.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{54}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the five spikers can be matched with any of the four setters to make $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ possible teams.\n\nThe one player who is fine either way can be matched with any of the nine other players to make $9$ possible teams.\n\nTherefore, there are $20 + 9 = \\boxed{29}$ possible teams in which no player feels out of position."
