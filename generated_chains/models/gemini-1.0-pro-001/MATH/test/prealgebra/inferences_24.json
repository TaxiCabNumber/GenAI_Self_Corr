At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA figure skater is facing north when she begins to spin to her right. She spins 2250 degrees. Which direction (north, south, east or west) is she facing when she finishes her spin?",
        "inference": "1. 2250 degrees is 61/4 times 360 degrees, so the skater has turned 61/4 full circles.\n2. Since she is turning to her right, this means she is turning clockwise.\n3. When you turn clockwise on a circle, you move through the directions in the following order: north, east, south, west, north, east, and so on.\n4. Since the skater has turned 61/4 full circles, she has moved through the directions 61/4 times.\n5. 61/4 is equal to 15.25, so the skater has moved through the directions 15 times and then some.\n6. The \"some\" is equal to 0.25 of a full circle, which is equal to 90 degrees.\n7. Since the skater is turning clockwise, this means she has moved through 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.\n8. 90 degrees in the clockwise direction from north is east.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{east}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each full circle is 360 degrees.  Dividing 360 into 2250 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 90.  So, she spins 90 degrees to her right past north, which leaves her facing $\\boxed{\\text{east}}$."
