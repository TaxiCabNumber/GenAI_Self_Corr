At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe five tallest buildings in Los Angeles in 1985 had a mean height of 733 feet. The tallest of the five buildings has a height of 858 feet, the shortest of the five 625 feet. If a new building were constructed with a height of 885 feet, by how many feet would it increase the mean height of the five tallest buildings of the city?",
        "inference": "Let the mean height of the four remaining buildings be x feet. Then, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{858+625+x+x+x+x}{5}=733$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$5x+1483=3665$$\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n$$x=\\frac{3665-1483}{5}=436$$\n\nTherefore, the mean height of the five tallest buildings would increase by:\n\n$$885-436=\\boxed{449}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{449}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the mean of the heights of the 5 tallest buildings in Los Angeles before the new building was built was 733, the sum of their heights must have been $5\\cdot733 = 3665$. After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller. Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\\boxed{52}$ feet. Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5."
