At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n22 people attend a party. Each person shakes hands with at most 20 other people. What is the maximum possible number of handshakes, assuming that any two people can shake hands at most once?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- Each person can shake hands with a maximum of 20 other people.\n- Let's assume that each person shakes hands with exactly 20 other people.\n- Then, the total number of handshakes is 20*22 = 440 handshakes.\n- However, each handshake is counted twice in this count (once for each person involved).\n- Therefore, the maximum possible number of handshakes is 440/2 = 220 handshakes.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{220}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If each person shakes hands with exactly 20 other people, then there will be $\\frac{22 \\cdot 20}{2} = \\boxed{220}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. To achieve 220 handshakes, we arrange the participants in a circle. Each person shakes hands with everyone except the person directly across from himself or herself (and himself or herself)."
