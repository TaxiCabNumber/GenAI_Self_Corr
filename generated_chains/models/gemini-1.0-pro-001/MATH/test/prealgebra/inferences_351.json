At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer $n$ such that $5n + 3 > -10$?",

        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $3$ from both sides of the inequality gives $5n>-13$, and dividing both sides by $5$ gives $n>-\\frac{13}{5}$. Since $-\\frac{13}{5}$ is between $-\\frac{15}{5}=-3$ and $-\\frac{10}{5}=-2$, the smallest integer $n$ satisfying our inequality is $\\boxed{-2}$."
