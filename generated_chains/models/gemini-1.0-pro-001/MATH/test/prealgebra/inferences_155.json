At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a class of 50 students, 28 participate in MATHCOUNTS, 21 participate in science club, and 6 students participate in neither. How many students participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club?",
        "inference": "Step 1:  Let's call the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science club $x$.\nStep 2:  We know that the total number of students in the class is 50, so we can write an equation: 28 + 21 - $x$ + 6 = 50.\nStep 3:  Simplifying this equation, we get - $x$ + 55 = 50.\nStep 4:  Subtracting 55 from both sides, we get - $x$ = -5.\nStep 5:  Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $x$ = 5.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Among the $50-6=44$ students that participate in either MATHCOUNTS or science club, $44-28=16$ students do not participate in MATHCOUNTS.  All 16 of these students only participate in science club.  The other $21-16=\\boxed{5}$ science club participants participate in MATHCOUNTS as well."
