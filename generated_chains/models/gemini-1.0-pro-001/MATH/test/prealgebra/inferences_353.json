        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe five-digit number $N = 14{,}9AB$ is divisible by 12. Given that $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, what is the smallest possible value of $N$?",
        "inference": "Since $N$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 3 and 4.\n\nFor $N$ to be divisible by 4, the last two digits, $AB$, must form a number that is divisible by 4. The smallest nonzero two-digit number that is divisible by 4 is 12, so $AB = 12$.\n\nFor $N$ to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. We have $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 17$, which is not divisible by 3. To make the sum divisible by 3, we need to increase $A$ by 1. So $A = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{14{,}922}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14{,}922}$. I hope it is correct.",
