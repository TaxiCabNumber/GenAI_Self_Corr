        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $\\boxed{N}$ mean the number of whole number divisors of $N$. For example, $\\boxed{3}=2$, because $3$ has two divisors, $1$ and $3.$ Find the value of \\[\\boxed{\\boxed{11}\\times\\boxed{20}}\\]",
        "inference": "First, we find the prime factors of $11$ and $20$:\n$$11=11,$$\n$$20=2^2\\times5.$$\nThen, we multiply the exponents of the prime factors of $11$ and $20$ by $1$ and add $1$ to each exponent:\n$$(1+1)\\times(2+1)=2\\times3=6.$$\nTherefore, the number of whole number divisors of $11\\times20$ is $6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Both $1$ and $11$ divide $11,$ so $\\boxed{11}=2$, and since $1,$ $2,$ $4,$ $5,$ $10,$ and $20$ divide $20,$ then $\\boxed{20}=6$. The inner expression, $\\boxed{11}\\times\\boxed{20}=2\\times6=12$. Finally, $\\boxed{12}=6$ because $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $12$ divide $12.$\n\nTherefore, $6$ is our answer. Please note that we have not boxed the correct answer as we normally do, as that would be especially confusing for this problem."
