At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEvery student in a homeroom class takes a biology course or a Spanish course or both. If 18 take biology, 13 take Spanish and 5 take both, how many students are in the homeroom classroom?",
        "inference": "There are 18 students who take only biology, 13 students who take only Spanish, and 5 students who take both biology and Spanish. So, the total number of students in the homeroom classroom is 18 + 13 - 5 = **26**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$26$}. I hope it is correct.",
