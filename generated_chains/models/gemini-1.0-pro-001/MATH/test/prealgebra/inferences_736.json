        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA woman 5-feet tall casts an 8-foot shadow. At the same time of day, the shadow of a tree nearby is 120 feet long. In feet, how tall is the tree?",
        "inference": "Shadow is directly proportional to height. So, the shadow of the woman can be expressed as '5x = 8', where 'x' is the ratio between the height of the woman and that of the tree. Similarly, for the tree, the shadow can be expressed as '5x = 120'. Solving this, the value of 'x' is found to be 24. Therefore, the height of the tree is 24 * 5 = 120 feet.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is a constant at a given time of day.  Therefore,  \\[\n\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{h}{120},\n\\]where $h$ is the height of the tree. Since $8\\times15=120$, $h=5\\times15=\\boxed{75}$ feet."
