        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bookcase has 3 shelves with a total of 24 books. The top shelf has 8 mystery books. The middle shelf has 10 math books. The bottom shelf has 6 science books. Two books are now taken off each shelf. What fraction of the books remaining on the three shelves are math books? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of books on each shelf after 2 are taken off.\n\nTop shelf: 8 - 2 = 6 books\nMiddle shelf: 10 - 2 = 8 books\nBottom shelf: 6 - 2 = 4 books\n\n**Step 2:** Find the total number of books remaining on the three shelves.\n\n6 + 8 + 4 = 18 books\n\n**Step 3:** Find the number of math books remaining on the three shelves.\n\nThe middle shelf has 8 math books, and no other shelf has math books.\n\n**Step 4:** Find the fraction of the books remaining that are math books.\n\n8 / 18 = 4 / 9\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{4/9}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Six books are removed from the shelves, so $24-6=18$ books remain.  Of these, $10-2=8$ are math books.  Therefore, $8/18=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$ of the books remaining are math books."
