        "inference": "At 3:30, the hour hand is halfway between 3 and 4, which is 3.5. The minute hand is at 6.\n\nThe hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so it moves 360/12 = 30 degrees per hour.\n\nTherefore, the hour hand has moved 3.5 * 30 = 105 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 360/60 = 6 degrees per minute.\n\nTherefore, the minute hand has moved 6 * 30 = 180 degrees from the 12 o'clock position.\n\nThe angle between the hour hand and the minute hand is the difference between their angles from the 12 o'clock position, which is 180 - 105 = 75 degrees.\n\n**Since it is an acute angle, the final Answer: \\boxed{$75^\\circ$}.

At 3:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 3 and the 4.
