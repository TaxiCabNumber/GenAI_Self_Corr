At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers $n$ satisfy both of the inequalities $4n + 3 < 25$ and $-7n + 5 < 24$?",
        "inference": "We have that $4n + 3 < 25$ if and only if $4n < 22$, if and only if $n < \\frac{22}{4} = \\frac{11}{2}$, if and only if $n < 6$.\n\nWe have that $-7n + 5 < 24$ if and only if $-7n < 19$, if and only if $n > -19/-7 = 19/7 >2$.\n\nSo the inequalities are satisfied if and only if $ 2 < n < 6$. So there are $6 - 3 = 3$ integers $n$ that satisfy both inequalities.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Subtract 3 and divide by 4 on both sides of the first inequality to obtain \\begin{align*}\n4n + 3 &< 25 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 4n &< 22 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n &< 5.5.\n\\end{align*}Similarly, the second inequality yields \\begin{align*}\n-7n + 5 &< 24 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -7n &< 19 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n &> -\\frac{19}{7}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive. There are $5$ positive integers, $2$ negative integers, and zero, so there are $\\boxed{8}$ integers that satisfy both $4n + 3 < 25$ and $-7n + 5 < 24$."
