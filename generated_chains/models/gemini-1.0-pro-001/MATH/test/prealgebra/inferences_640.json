        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 3:2:1. Given that the shortest side of the triangle is 12 meters long, what is the number of meters in the longest side of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let the angles be 3x, 2x, and x.\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.\nSo, 3x + 2x + x = 180\n6x = 180\nx = 30\nLet the lengths of the sides be 3y, 2y, and y.\nWe are given that the shortest side is 12 meters long, so y = 12.\nThe longest side is 3y = 3(12) = 36 meters.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$36$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\\circ$, so $x=30^\\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $30^\\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ meters."
