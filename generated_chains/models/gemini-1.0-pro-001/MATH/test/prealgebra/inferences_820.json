At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stairway with three steps has three risers that are each 8 inches high and three treads that are each 10 inches deep. What is the area, in square inches, of this figure that is the side panel of the stairway?\n\n[asy]size(101);\nreal textsize = 10pt;\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(30,8)--(20,8)--(20,16)--(10,16)--(10,24)--(0,24)--cycle);\ndraw((31,0)--(33,0)^^(32,0)--(32,8)^^(31,8)--(33,8));\nlabel(\"$8''$ riser\",(33,4),E,fontsize(textsize));\ndraw((10,25)--(10,27)^^(10,26)--(20,26)^^(20,25)--(20,27));\nlabel(\"$10''$\",(15,27),N,fontsize(textsize));\nlabel(\"tread\",(15,32),N,fontsize(textsize));[/asy]",
        "inference": "The area of the side panel is the sum of the areas of the three risers and the three treads. The area of one riser is 8 inches x 10 inches = 80 square inches, and the area of one tread is 10 inches x 10 inches = 100 square inches. Therefore, the area of the side panel is 3 x 80 + 3 x 100 = 240 + 300 = 540 square inches.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$540$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can see that this figure is composed of six $8$ inch by $10$ inch rectangles. Thus, the total area is $6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{480}$ square inches."
