At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways can I put down two indistinguishable pieces on an ordinary $8\\times 8$ chessboard, if the pieces must either be in the same row or be in the same column?",
        "inference": "Consider positioning two pieces on the chessboard. Each piece may be placed on any of 64squares, so there are $ 64^2= 4096 $ ways to place two pieces on arbitrarily chosen squares.\n\nHowever, because the pieces are indistinguishable, we must divide by 2 to eliminate \"duplicate\"  placements such as the placing of the first piece on c4 and the second on c4 and the placing of the first piece on c4 and the second on c4. Therefore, there are $ \\frac{4096}{2}=2048 $.\n\nPieces must either be in the same row or be in the same column. So, there are  64 ways to put the pieces in a column and $8 \\times 8=64$ to place the pieces on a row.\n\n**So, there are $2048-64-64=1920$ solutions.**\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1920}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares. The second piece can then be in any of $14$ positions, since there are $7$ unoccupied squares in the row of the first piece, as well as $7$ unoccupied squares in the column of the first piece. This would seem to give us $64\\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces. However, order doesn't matter (we said the pieces are indistinguishable), so the actual number of choices is $(64\\cdot 14)/2$, which is $\\boxed{448}$."
