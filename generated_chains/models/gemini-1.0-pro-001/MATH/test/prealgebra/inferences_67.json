At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a world record, George Adrian picked 15,832 pounds of apples in 8 hours. Assuming he maintained a constant rate of picking, how many pounds of apples did he pick in 3 hours?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find George's rate of picking apples**\nRate = (Total apples picked) / (Total time taken)\nRate = 15,832 pounds / 8 hours\nRate = 1,979 pounds/hour\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of pounds picked in 3 hours**\nPounds picked in 3 hours = (Rate) * (3 hours)\nPounds picked in 3 hours = 1,979 pounds/hour * 3 hours\nPounds picked in 3 hours = 5,937 pounds\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5,937$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "In $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many hours, George picks $\\frac{3}{8}$ as many pounds of apples.  Therefore, George picked $\\frac{3}{8}(15,\\!832)=\\frac{3}{8}(16,\\!000-168)=3(2000)-3(21)=\\boxed{5937}$ pounds of apples in 3 hours."
