Then the length of the longer leg is $\\sqrt{3}x$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. So, we have\n\n$$(2\\sqrt{6})^2=x^2+(\\sqrt{3}x)^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get\n\n$$24=x^2+3x^2=4x^2$$\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get\n\n$$x^2=6$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n\n$$x=\\sqrt{6}$$\n\nSo, the length of the shorter leg is $\\sqrt{6}$ centimeters.
