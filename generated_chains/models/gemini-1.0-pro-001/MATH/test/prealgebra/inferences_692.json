        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSarah, James, and Matthew are on a team in a game show. In the game, Sarah always earns 5 points, Matthew always earns -2 points, and James always earns 3 points. To calculate their team's score, they multiply the first person's score by the second person's score, then subtract the third person's score. If they can choose the order in which they play the game, what is the maximum possible score that their team can earn?",
        "inference": "First, we want to find the maximum score that Sarah and Matthew can earn. Since Sarah always earns 5 points, and Matthew always earns -2 points, the maximum score they can earn is if Sarah plays first, because then Matthew's score will be multiplied by Sarah's score. So, Sarah and Matthew's maximum score is 5 * -2 = -10.\n\nNow, we need to subtract James' score from Sarah and Matthew's score. James always earns 3 points, so the team's score will be -10 - 3 = -13.\n\nSo, the maximum possible score that their team can earn is -13.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{-13}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \\cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:\n$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$\n$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 5) - 3) = -13$\n$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((5 \\cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$\n$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow ((3 \\cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$\n$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \\rightarrow (((-2) \\cdot 3) - 5) = -11$\nThus, our total answer is $\\boxed{17}$\nAdditionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \\cdot 5) - (-2) = \\boxed{17}$"
