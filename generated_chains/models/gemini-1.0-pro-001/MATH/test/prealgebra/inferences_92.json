        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt takes $8$ cups of chocolate chips to make $12$ cookies. How many cups of chocolate chips will it take to make $15$ cookies?",
        "inference": "1. To find out how many cups of chocolate chips are needed to make 1 cookie, we need to divide the total amount of chocolate chips by the number of cookies that can be made with those chocolate chips.\n$$\\text{Chocolate chips per cookie = }\\frac{\\text{Total chocolate chips}}{\\text{Number of cookies}}$$\n\n2.  Substituting the given values, we get:\n$$\\text{Chocolate chips per cookie = }\\frac{8}{12}=\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ cups}$$\n\n3. Now that we know how many cups of chocolate chips are needed to make 1 cookie, we can multiply the number of cookies we want to make by the amount of chocolate chips needed for each cookie to find the total amount of chocolate chips needed.\n$$\\text{Total chocolate chips = }\\text{Number of cookies}\\times\\text{Chocolate chips per cookie}$$\n\n4. Substituting the given values, we get:\n$$\\text{Total chocolate chips = }15\\times\\frac{2}{3}=\\boxed{10} \\text{ cups}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The proportion of cups of chocolate chips to cookies is constant and can be simplified as $\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, if $x$ is the number of cups of chocolate chips it will take to make $15$ cookies, $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{15}$. Solving for $x$ gives an answer of $\\boxed{10}$ cups.\n\nBy the way, $\\frac{2}{3}$ cup of chips for a cookie? Wowzers."
