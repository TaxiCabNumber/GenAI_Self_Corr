        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest multiple of $5$ which is greater than $-32$?",
        "inference": "Since $5$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by $5$, we need only find the smallest non-negative integer $n$ such that $5n > -32$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $5$ gives $n > -6.4$. The smallest non-negative integer greater than $-6.4$ is $0$. Therefore, the smallest multiple of $5$ which is greater than $-32$ is $5 \\times 0 = 0$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Dividing $-32$ by $5$ gives $-6$ with a remainder of $-2$, or $$-32 = -6 \\cdot 5 - 2.$$Thus, $-6 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{-30}$ is the smallest multiple of $5$ that is greater than $-32$."
