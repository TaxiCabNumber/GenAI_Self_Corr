At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn a particular January day, the high temperature in Lincoln, Nebraska, was $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, and the average of the high and the low temperatures was $3\\,^\\circ$. In degrees, what was the low temperature in Lincoln that day?",
        "inference": "Let's call the low temperature $x$ degrees. Then, the high temperature is $x+16$ degrees.\n\nThe average of the high and the low temperatures is ($x+(x+16)$)/2 = $x+8$ degrees.\n\nWe are told that the average of the high and the low temperatures was $3^\\circ$. So, we have the equation:\n\n$$x+8=3$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x=-5$$\n\nTherefore, the low temperature in Lincoln that day was $-5^\\circ$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-5^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the high temperature is $16$ degrees higher than the low temperature, it follows that the average of the two temperatures, which lies halfway between the high and low temperatures, must be $8$ degrees higher than the low temperature and $8$ degrees lower than the high temperature. Thus, if the average is $3^\\circ,$ then the low temperature is $3^\\circ - 8^\\circ = \\boxed{-5^\\circ}.$"
