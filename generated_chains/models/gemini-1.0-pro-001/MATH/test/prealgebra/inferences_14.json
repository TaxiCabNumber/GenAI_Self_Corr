At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a 12-hour analog clock reads 8:00, what is the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe minute hand makes a full rotation (360 degrees) in 60 minutes. So, in 8 minutes, it moves $\\frac{8}{60} \\cdot 360 = 48$ degrees.\n\nThe hour hand makes a full rotation (360 degrees) in 12 hours. So, in 8 hours, it moves $\\frac{8}{12} \\cdot 360 = 240$ degrees.\n\nThe smaller angle between the hands is the difference between the angles made by the hour and minute hands: $240 - 48 = 192$ degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$192$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The hour hand is at $8$ and the minute hand is at $12$, which span 4 hours.  Each hour on the 12-hour analog clock spans $360/12=30$ degrees, so the angle formed here is $30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
