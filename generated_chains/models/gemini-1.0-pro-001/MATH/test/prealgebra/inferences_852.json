At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 5-inch by 7-inch picture is placed on a rectangular piece of red paper such that a 0.5-inch wide red border is seen along each side of the picture. What is the area of the visible red border, in square inches?",
        "inference": "The width of the red border on each side = 0.5 inch\n\nThe length of the picture = 5 inches\nThe breadth of the picture = 7 inches\n\nThe outer length = (5 + 2 * 0.5) inches = 6 inches\nThe outer breadth = (7 + 2 * 0.5) inches = 8 inches\n\nThe area of the visible red border = Area of the outer rectangle - Area of the inner rectangle\n= (6 * 8) - (5 * 7) square inches\n= 48 - 35 square inches\n= 13 square inches\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The piece of red paper must have dimensions of 6 inches by 8 inches in order to have a 0.5 inch border on each side. The area of the paper is 48 square inches, of which $5\\cdot 7 = 35$ square inches are obscured by the picture. Therefore, the area of the visible red border is $48 - 35 = \\boxed{13}$ square inches."
