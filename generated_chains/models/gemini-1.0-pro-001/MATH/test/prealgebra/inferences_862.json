At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA right triangle has two sides of length $6$ units each.  What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
        "inference": "The area of a triangle is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, we have two sides of length $6$ units, but we don't know which side is the base and which side is the height. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the third side of the triangle, and the other two sides are the two sides of length $6$ units. So, we have:\n```\n$$h^2 + b^2 = c^2$$\n```\nwhere $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. Substituting $6$ for $b$ and $h$, we get:\n```\n$$6^2 + 6^2 = c^2$$\n```\n```\n$$36 + 36 = c^2$$\n```\n```\n$$72 = c^2$$\n```\n```\n$$\\sqrt{72} = c$$\n```\n$$c = 6\\sqrt{2}$$\n```\nNow that we know the length of the hypotenuse, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of the triangle. Substituting $6$ for $b$ and $6\\sqrt{2}$ for $h$, we get:\n```\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2}(6)(6\\sqrt{2})$$\n```\n```\n$$A = 18\\sqrt{2}$$\n```\nSo, the area of the triangle is $18\\sqrt{2}$ square units.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{18\\sqrt2} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The two lengths of 6 units must be the two bases of the right triangle, because the hypotenuse in a right triangle must be longer than each base. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6\\cdot6}{2}=\\boxed{18}$ square units."
