At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo 6-sided dice, one red and one green, are rolled.  What is the probability that the red die shows a 2 and the green die shows a 5?",
        "inference": "There are 36 possible outcomes when two dice are rolled.\n\nThe red die can show any of the numbers 1 to 6, and the green die can also show any of the numbers 1 to 6.\n\nThe probability of the red die showing a 2 is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe probability of the green die showing a 5 is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe probability of both events happening is $\\frac{1}{6} * \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We solve this problem by counting outcomes.  There is only 1 successful outcome: a red 2 and a green 5.  Rolling each die is an independent event, so we multiply the 6 possible outcomes for the red die by the 6 possible outcomes for the green die, to get 36 total outcomes.  Hence the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$."
