At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen you sketch a figure of an adult male, it is recommended that the head be $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the total height. If the full drawn height of a 6-foot man is 16 inches, how many inches should the drawing of his head be from top to bottom?",
