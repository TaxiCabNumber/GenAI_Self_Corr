At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product $ab = 1200$, $a$ is an integer, and $b$ is an odd integer. What is the largest possible value of $b$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $b$ is odd, it can be written as $b = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Then, we have $ab = 1200 = a(2k + 1)$, so $a = \\frac{1200}{2k + 1}$. Since $a$ is an integer, $\\frac{1200}{2k + 1}$ must be an integer. The largest possible value of $b$ is when $\\frac{1200}{2k + 1}$ is the smallest possible positive integer, which is 1. This occurs when $k = 599$, so $b = 2 \\cdot 599 + 1 = 1199$.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1199$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 from 1200, we find that $1200=2^4\\cdot75$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{75}$."
