At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSimone has a collection of coins consisting of 1 quarter, 1 nickel and 1 penny. Using at least two coins from the collection, how many different sums of money are possible?",
        "inference": "Simone has a quarter, a nickel, and a penny. To calculate the number of different sums of money she can make, we can first list all the possible combinations of coins she can use:\n\n1. Quarter and nickel: 35 cents\n2. Quarter and penny: 26 cents\n3. Nickel and penny: 6 cents\n\nSince Simone must use at least two coins, we do not consider the case of using only one coin. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ different sums of money she can make.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are two ways to form a sum: either by leaving out one coin or by not leaving out any. There are three options if we want to leave out one coin, and obviously only one way to not leave out any, so that gives us our answer of $3+1=\\boxed{4}$."
