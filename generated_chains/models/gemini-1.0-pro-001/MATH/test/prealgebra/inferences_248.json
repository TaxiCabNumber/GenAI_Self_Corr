At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA stock loses $10\\%$ of its value on Monday.  On Tuesday it loses  $20\\%$ of the value it had at the end of the day on Monday.  What is  the overall percent loss in value from the beginning of Monday to  the end of Tuesday?  Enter the answer as a percent.",

This means  it had $90\\%$ of its original value at the end of Monday.  \n\nOn Tuesday, it lost  $20\\%$ of its value from the end of Monday. This means it had $100\\% - 20\\% = 80\\%$ of its value at the end of Monday left at the end of Tuesday.  \n\nSo the overall percent loss is $100\\% - 80\\% = \\boxed{20\\%}$. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}.$ I hope it is correct.",
