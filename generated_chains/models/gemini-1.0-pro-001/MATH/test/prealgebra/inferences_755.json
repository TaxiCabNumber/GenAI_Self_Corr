At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of the six members from the Skateer University hockey team shakes hands with each of the six members of the Iceburg Tech team. How many handshakes take place?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are 6 members from each team. So, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible handshakes. However, each handshake involves two people, so we need to divide by 2 to avoid counting each handshake twice. Therefore, the number of handshakes is 36/2 = 18.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Each member of the team from Skateer University will shake hands once with each member of the Iceburg Tech team, which will be 6 handshakes each.  This will give a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ handshakes."
