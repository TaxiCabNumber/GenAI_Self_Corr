        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded in half to form a rectangle. If the resulting rectangle has a perimeter of 18 inches, what is the area of the original square, in square inches?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Identify the variables.**\nLet's call the original length of a side of the square \\(x\\) inches.\n\n**Step 2: Write an equation for the perimeter of the rectangle.**\nWhen the square is folded in half, it forms a rectangle with a length of \\(x\\) inches and a width of \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) inches. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula \\(P = 2L + 2W\\), where \\(P\\) is the perimeter, \\(L\\) is the length, and \\(W\\) is the width. In this case, we have:\n\n$$P = 2x + 2\\left ( \\frac{x}{2} \\right ) = 2x + x = 3x$$\n\n**Step 3: Set the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle equal to 18 inches and solve for \\(x\\).**\nWe know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 18 inches, so we can write:\n\n$$3x = 18$$\n$$x = 6$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the original square.**\nThe area of a square is given by the formula \\(A = s^2\\), where \\(A\\) is the area and \\(s\\) is the length of a side. In this case, the length of a side of the original square is 6 inches, so the area is:\n\n$$A = 6^2 = 36$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{36}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square. The rectangle has sides of length $s$ and $s/2$, and its perimeter is $3s = 18$. It follows that $s = 6$, so the area of the original square is $\\boxed{36}$."
