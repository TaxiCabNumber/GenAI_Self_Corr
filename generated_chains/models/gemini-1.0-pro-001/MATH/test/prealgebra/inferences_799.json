At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many possible 9-digit zip codes are possible if the first digit cannot be zero?",
        "inference": "First, we find the number of choices for the first digit. Since the first digit cannot be zero, there are $9$ possible choices for the first digit.\n\nNext, we find the number of choices for each of the remaining $8$ digits. There are $10$ possible choices for each digit, since digits can range from $0$ to $9$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible $9$-digit zip codes is $9 \\times 10^8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9 \\times 10^8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are nine choices for the first digit and ten for the eight thereafter. Thus, there are $9 \\cdot 10^8 = \\boxed{900,\\!000,\\!000}$ such zip codes."
