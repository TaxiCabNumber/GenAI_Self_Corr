At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA chocolate chip cookie recipe calls for 15 cups of flour for 20 dozen cookies. How many cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert 20 dozen to the number of cookies:\n20 dozen = 20 x 12 = 240 cookies\n\n**Step 2:** Set up a proportion to find the number of cups of flour needed for 144 cookies:\n15 cups flour / 240 cookies = x cups flour / 144 cookies\n\n**Step 3:** Cross-multiply and solve for x:\n15 * 144 = x * 240\nx = (15 * 144) / 240\nx = 9\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$9}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Converting 144 to 12 dozen, we see that we are making $\\frac{12}{20}=\\frac{3}{5}$ as many cookies as the recipe makes.  Therefore, we need $\\frac{3}{5}$ as much flour, which is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot15=\\boxed{9}$ cups."
