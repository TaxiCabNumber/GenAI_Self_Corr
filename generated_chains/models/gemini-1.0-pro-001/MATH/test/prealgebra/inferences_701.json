        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a girl 5 feet tall could walk around the equator, how many feet further would the top of her head travel than her feet? Assume that the earth is a sphere. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe circumference of the Earth at the equator is $2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the Earth.\n\nThe girl's height is $5$ feet, so the distance from the top of her head to her feet is $5$ feet.\n\nThe distance from the top of her head to the center of the Earth is $r + 5$ feet.\n\nThe distance from her feet to the center of the Earth is $r$ feet.\n\nThe distance the top of her head travels further than her feet is $(r + 5) - r = 5$ feet.\n\nTherefore, the distance the top of her head travels further than her feet is $5$ feet.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the radius of the earth in feet. The girl's feet travel along a circle of radius $r$, while the girl's head travels along a circle of radius $r+5$. The circumference of the first circle is $2\\pi r$, while the circumference of the second circle is $2\\pi(r+5) = 2\\pi r + 10\\pi$. So her head travels $(2\\pi r + 10\\pi) - 2\\pi r = \\boxed{10\\pi}$ feet more than her feet."
