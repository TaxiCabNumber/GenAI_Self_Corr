At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe figure below is composed of the rectangles $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ with whole number values for length and width. The areas of regions $A$, $B$, and $C$ in square meters, are shown in the diagram. What is the area in square meters of rectangle $D$?

        "inference": "From the diagram, the area of $A = 40 m^2$ and the area of $B = 25 m^2$. Therefore, the area of the region $A$ and $B$ is $40 + 25 = 65 m^2$. Since the two segments of the horizontal line segments that make up the lower border of $A$ and $B$ extend $8$ units from the right border of $D$, the area of $D$ is $8 \\times 65 = 520 m^2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{520}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the length and width are whole number values, the dimensions of rectangle $B$ must be $1\\times25$ or $5\\times5$. Rectangle $B$ shares a sidelength with rectangle $A$ and another sidelength with rectangle $C$, so each sidelength must also be a factor of the other rectangle's area. Since $25$ is not a factor of $40$ or $30$, it cannot be a sidelength of rectangle $B$. That means rectangle $B$ is a $5\\times5$ rectangle, which makes the respective dimensions of rectangle $A$ and $C$ $8\\times5$ and $5\\times 6$. The area of rectangle $D$ is then $8\\times6=\\boxed{48}$ square meters."
