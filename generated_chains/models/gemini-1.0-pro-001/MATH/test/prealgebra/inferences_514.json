At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn elephant and a lion are currently 1 mile apart. The elephant runs directly away from the lion at 19 miles per hour, while the lion runs directly towards the elephant at 24 miles per hour.  How many minutes will it take for the lion to catch the elephant?",
        "inference": "Speed of the elephant (away from the lion) = 19 miles/hour\nSpeed of the lion (towards the elephant) = 24 miles/hour\n\nRelative speed of the lion with respect to the elephant = (24 + 19) miles/hour = 43 miles/hour\n\nTime taken by the lion to catch the elephant = Distance between the elephant and the lion / Relative speed of the lion with respect to the elephant\n= 1 mile / 43 miles/hour\n\nConverting hours to minutes:\n1 hour = 60 minutes\nTime taken by the lion to catch the elephant = (1 mile / 43 miles/hour) * 60 minutes/hour\n= 1.395 minutes\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1.395}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Every hour, the lion runs 24 miles while the elephant runs 19.  Thus, the distance between the two animals closes at a rate of 5 miles every hour.  The lion catches the elephant after this distance has closed 1 mile, which takes $\\frac{1}{5}$ hours to do, or $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{12}$ minutes."
