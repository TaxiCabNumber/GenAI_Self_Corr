At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many three-digit positive integers are there?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe three-digit positive integers are those between 100 and 999.\n\nThe first digit can be any of the digits 1 through 9, so there are 9 possibilities for the first digit.\n\nThe second digit can be any of the digits 0 through 9, so there are 10 possibilities for the second digit.\n\nThe third digit can be any of the digits 0 through 9, so there are 10 possibilities for the third digit.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit positive integers is \n$$\\boxed{9 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 900}$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{900}$.

        "ground_truth": "We are trying to count the number of numbers in the sequence $100, 101, 102, \\ldots , 998, 999$. If we subtract 99 from every term in the sequence it becomes $1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 899, 900$. So, there are $\\boxed{900}$ positive integers with 3 digits."
