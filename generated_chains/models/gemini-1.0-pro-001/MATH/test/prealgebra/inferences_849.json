At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe four-digit number $25AB$ is divisible by nine, with $A$ the tens digit and $B$ the units digit. How many different such four-digit numbers could $25AB$ represent?",
        "inference": "For divisibility by 9, digit sum must be divisible by 9.\n\nDigit sum of 25AB is 2 + 5 + A + B = 7 + A + B.\n\nTherefore, A + B = 2 or 11.\n\nCase 1: A + B = 2\n- A = 1, B = 1\n- A = 2, B = 0\n\nCase 2: A + B = 11\n- A = 9, B = 2\n- A = 8, B = 3\n- A = 7, B = 4\n- A = 6, B = 5\n\nTherefore, the total number of different four-digit numbers is 2 + 4 = 6.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $2+5=7$ and $2+5+A+B$ is divisible by 9, $A+B$ must be at least 2. Therefore, the least multiple of 9 greater than 2500 is 2502.  We may add multiples of 9 to 2502 to obtain all the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600, and 90 is the greatest multiple of 9 we may add without exceeding 2600.  In other words, the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600 are the integers of the form $2502+9k$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 10.  There are $\\boxed{11}$ values of $k$ between 0 and 10 inclusive."
