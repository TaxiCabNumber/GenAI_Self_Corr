        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is a face card (a Jack, Queen, or King)?",
        "inference": "Since there are 4 suits and each suit contains 3 face cards, there are a total of 3 * 4 = 12 face cards in a standard deck. If a card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing a face card is the number of face cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 12/52 = 3/13.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$3/13$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $3 \\times 4 = 12$ face cards and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a face card is $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{13}}$."
