At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 8 sprinters in the Olympic 100-meter finals.  The gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.   In how many ways can the medals be awarded?",

Once the silver medal has been assigned, there are 6 runners remaining to take the bronze medal in 6 ways.  By the Multiplication Principle, the number of ways the medals can be awarded is 8 * 7 * 6 = 336.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{336}. I hope it is correct.",
