At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 30 cars in my building's parking lot.  All of the cars are red or white, and a car can have either 2 doors or 4 doors. $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them are red, $50\\%$ of them are 4-door, and 8 of them are 2-door and white.  How many of the cars are 4-door and red?",
        "inference": "**Solution:** \n\n 1. $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them are red, so there are $30 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 10$ red cars.\n\n 2. 8 of them are 2-door and white, so there are $30 - 8 = 22$ cars that are either 4-door or red (or both).\n\n 3. $50\\%$ of them are 4-door, so there are $30 \\times 0.5 = 15$ 4-door cars.\n\n 4.

There are $(50\\%)\\cdot 30 = (0.5)(30) = 15$ cars that are 4-door cars, so $15-x$ of the 4-door cars are not red.  We then have the following Venn diagram:\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Red cars\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"4-door cars\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"White 2-door cars: 8\",(44,10));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$10-x$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$15-x$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]\n\nAdding all four categories, we have  \\[(10-x)+x+(15-x) + 8 = 30.\\]Simplifying gives $33-x = 30$, so $x = \\boxed{3}$."
