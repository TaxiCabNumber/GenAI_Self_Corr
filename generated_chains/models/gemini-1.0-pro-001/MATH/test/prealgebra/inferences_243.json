At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square and a right triangle have equal perimeters.  The legs of the right triangle are 20 inches and 15 inches.  What is the area of the square, in square inches?",
        "inference": "1. Perimeter of the square = 4x, where x is the length of one side of the square.\n2. Perimeter of the triangle = 20 + 15 + c, where c is the hypotenuse of the triangle.\n3. Since the perimeters are equal, 4x = 20 + 15 + c\n4. c = 4x - 35\n5. Area of the triangle = (1/2) * 20 * 15 = 150 square inches\n6. Area of the square = x^2\n7. Since the triangle and the square have equal areas, x^2 = 150\n8. x = sqrt(150) = 5 * sqrt(6) inches\n9. Area of the square = x^2 = (5 * sqrt(6))^2 = 25 * 6 = 150 square inches\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{150}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The legs of the right triangle are in a $3:4$ ratio, so the right triangle is similar to a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle and thus it has hypotenuse $5\\cdot 5 = 25$.  The perimeter of the right triangle is then $15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.  Then the square has side length $60/4=15$ and area $15^2 = \\boxed{225}$ square inches."
