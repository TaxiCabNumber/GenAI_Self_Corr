At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest possible area, in square centimeters, of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm?",
        "inference": "The area of a right triangle is given by the formula:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} * b * h$$\n\nwhere b is the length of the base and h is the height.\n\nIn this problem, we are given that the length of the base is 20 cm and the length of the height is 12 cm.\n\nSo, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:\n\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} * 20 cm * 12 cm$$\n\n$$A = 120 cm^2$$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible area of a right triangle with one side of length 12 cm and another side of length 20 cm is 120 square centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$120$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.\n\nIf the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.\n\nThe largest possible area then is $\\boxed{120}$ square centimeters."
