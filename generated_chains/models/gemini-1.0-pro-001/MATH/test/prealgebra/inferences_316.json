At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSam the Sham is an unfair shoe salesman. He has a pair of shoes that was priced at $\\$60$ last week. To entice customers, he wants to put a \"$25\\%$ off'' tag on the shoes but he still wants the customer to pay $\\$60$ for the shoes. He raises the price of the shoes so that after the $25\\%$ discount the shoes will cost $\\$60$. In dollars, what must the new price of the shoes be before the discount?",
        "inference": "Let the original price of the shoes be $x$ dollars.\n\nAfter the $25\\%$ discount, the price of the shoes will be \n$$0.75x$$ \n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n$$0.75x=60$$ \n\nSolving for $x$, we get \n\n$$x=60/0.75=80$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$80}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the new price of the shoes be $x$. We are told that after a $25\\%$ discount, the shoes cost 60 dollars. Thus, $\\frac{3}{4}x = 60$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{80}$."
