        "inference": "**Step 1: Establish a proportionality ratio.**\n\nThe ratio of the height of the flagpole to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the woman to the length of her shadow.\n\n```\nflagpole_height / flagpole_shadow = woman_height / woman_shadow\n```\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the given values.**\n\n```\n20 / flagpole_shadow = 6 / 9\n```\n\n**Step 3: Cross-multiply.**\n\n```\n20 * 9 = 6 * flagpole_shadow\n```\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the flagpole shadow length.**\n\n```\nflagpole_shadow = (20 * 9) / 6\n```\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the value.**\n\n```\nflagpole_shadow = 30\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{30}$.

        "ground_truth": "From the woman, we know that $$\\text{length of shadow}:\\text{height of object} = 9:6.$$ In other words, the length of an object's shadow is $\\frac{9}{6}$ of the height of the object.
