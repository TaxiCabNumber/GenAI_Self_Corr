At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn triangle $ABC$, the measure of angle $A$ is $x$ degrees, the measure of angle $B$ is $2x$ degrees and the measure of angle $C$ is $5x$ degrees. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
