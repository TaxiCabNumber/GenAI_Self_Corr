        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ambulance travels at 40 mph and can follow a 20-mile route making no stops to get to the hospital. A helicopter travels at one mile per minute, and the air route is 15 miles to get to the same hospital. However, the helicopter takes three minutes for takeoff and three minutes for landing. How many fewer minutes does it take for the helicopter to complete its trip (takeoff, flight and landing) than for the ambulance to complete its trip?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n- The ambulance:\nSpeed 40 mph = 40/60 = 2/3 miles per minute.\nNo stops.\nTime = Distance/Speed = 20 miles/(2/3 miles per minute) = 30 minutes.\n- The helicopter:\nTakes 3 minutes for takeoff and 3 minutes for landing.\nFlight time = \nSpeed 1 mile per minute.\nDistance = 15 miles.\nTime = Distance/Speed = 15 miles/1 mile per minute = 15 minutes.\nTotal time = 15 + 3 + 3 = 21 minutes.\n- Difference in time:\nAmbulance time - Helicopter time = 30 - 21 = 9 minutes.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$9$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the ambulance travels at 40 miles per hour and takes a 20 mile route to the hospital, it will take half an hour, or 30 minutes. The helicopter takes three minutes to take off, three minutes to land, and 15 minutes to travel to the hospital, for a total of 21 minutes. Therefore, it takes the helicopter $30 - 21 = \\boxed{9}$ fewer minutes to complete its trip."
