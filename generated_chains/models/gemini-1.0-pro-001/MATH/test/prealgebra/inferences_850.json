        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet the side lengths be $8x$, $8y$, and $8z$. Then by Pythagorean Theorem, we have\n\n\n$$(8x)^2+(8y)^2=(8z)^2\\Rightarrow x^2+y^2=z^2.$$Since $x, y,$ and $z$ are positive integers, we can assume that $x\\leq y\\leq z$. Then we have $x^2+y^2=z^2$, which is a Pythagorean triple. The smallest such triple is $(3, 4, 5)$, so we have $x=3$, $y=4$, and $z=5$. Thus, the side lengths are $8x=24$, $8y=32$, and $8z=40$, and the perimeter is $24+32+40=\\boxed{96}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$96$}. I hope it is correct.**",
