        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain negative number is multiplied by six, the result is the  same as 20 less than the original number.  What is the value of the  original number?",
        "inference": "Let x be the original number.\n\nWe know that 6x = x - 20, since the product of the negative number and 6 is 20 less than the original number.\n\nWe can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides:\n\n6x - x = x - 20 - x\n\n5x = -20\n\nx = -4\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{-4}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $6x=x-20$. Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives $5x=-20$. Then, dividing both sides by 5 gives $x= \\boxed{-4}$."
