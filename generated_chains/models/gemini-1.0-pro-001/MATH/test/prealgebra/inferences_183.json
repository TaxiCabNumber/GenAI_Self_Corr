At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of the supplement of an angle measuring $50$ degrees?",
        "inference": "The supplement of an angle is $180$ degrees minus the angle.\n\nTherefore, the supplement of an angle measuring $50$ degrees is $180 - 50 = 130$ degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{130}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Two supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Thus the supplement of 50 degrees is $180-50=\\boxed{130}$ degrees."
