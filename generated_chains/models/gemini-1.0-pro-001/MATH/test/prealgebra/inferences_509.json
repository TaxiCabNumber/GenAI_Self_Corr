At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular quilt's length is twice the length of a rectangular picture, and the quilt's width is three times the width of the same picture. The area of the picture is 2 square feet. What is the area of the quilt, in square feet?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the width of the picture as w and the length of the picture as l.\nArea of the picture = 2 square feet\nTherefore, w * l = 2\nThe length of the quilt is twice the length of the picture, so the length of the quilt is 2l.\nThe width of the quilt is three times the width of the picture, so the width of the quilt is 3w.\nArea of the quilt = length of the quilt * width of the quilt\n= 2l * 3w\n= 6lw\n= 6(2)(1)\n= 12\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$12$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the quilt is twice as long, the area is twice as large when only considering that dimension.  Since it is also 3 times as wide, the area then triples (including the doubling of size due to the length).  Thus, the area of the quilt is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ times larger, making for an area of $\\boxed{12}$ square feet."
