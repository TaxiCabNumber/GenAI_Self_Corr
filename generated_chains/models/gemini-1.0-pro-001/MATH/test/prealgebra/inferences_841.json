At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe distance between two cities on a map is 4 centimeters. If the scale is 0.5 cm:1 km, how many kilometers apart are the actual cities?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Convert the map distance to kilometers.**\n\nDistance on map = 4 centimeters\n\nScale = 0.5 cm:1 km\n\nDistance on map = (4 cm) x (1 km / 0.5 cm) = 8 kilometers\n\n**Step 2: The actual cities are 8 kilometers apart.**\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have the ratio $$0.5 \\text{ cm on the map} : 1 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 2, we have the equivalent ratio $$1 \\text{ cm on the map} : 2 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Multiplying both parts by 4, we find the equivalent ratio$$4 \\text{ cm on the map} : 8 \\text{ km in reality}.$$ Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{8}$ kilometers apart in reality."
