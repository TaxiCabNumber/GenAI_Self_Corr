        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe lengths in feet of three pieces of timber are 48, 72, and 40. The sawmill operator needs to cut the timber into logs of equal length with no waste. How many feet long is the greatest possible length she can cut?",
        "inference": "1. Find the greatest common factor of the lengths of the three pieces of timber:\n$$48 = 2^4 \\cdot 3$$\n\n$$72 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2$$\n\n$$40 = 2^3 \\cdot 5$$\n\nThe greatest common factor is $2^3 = 8$.\n\n2. The greatest possible length of the logs is 8 feet.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order to cut all three pieces of timber into equal length logs, the length of the logs must be a factor of each of the three original lengths. The prime factors of 48 are $2^4\\cdot3$, those of 72 are $2^3\\cdot3^2$, and those of 40 are $2^3\\cdot5$. The greatest common factor of all three is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$, so that is the greatest possible length the sawmill operator can cut."
