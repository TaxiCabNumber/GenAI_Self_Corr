At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perfect squares from $1$ through $2500,$ inclusive, are printed in a sequence of digits $1491625\\ldots2500.$ How many digits are in the sequence?",
        "inference": "$1$ through $2500$ there are 50 perfect squares. Each perfect square has 1 to 4 digits. The number of digits in the sequence is therefore between $50$ and $200.$ To find the exact number of digits, we can count the number of digits in each perfect square and add them up. For example, $1$ has $1$ digit, $4$ has $1$ digit, $9$ has $1$ digit, $16$ has $2$ digits, and so on. The number of digits in the sequence is:\n\n$$1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+3+4+4+\\cdots+4+4+4$$ $$=1+2+3+4+\\cdots+20+25\\\\ =\\frac{25(25+1)}{2}=325$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{325}.$ I hope it is correct.",
