At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the product of $0.\\overline{05}$ and $1.8$ expressed as a fraction in simplest form?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x=0.\\overline{05}$. Then $100x=5.\\overline{05}$. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $100x-x=5.\\overline{05}-0.\\overline{05}$, which means $99x=5$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $99$, we get $x=\\frac{5}{99}$.\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{05}\\cdot1.8=\\frac{5}{99}\\cdot\\frac{18}{10}=\\frac{5\\cdot18}{99\\cdot10}=\\frac{5\\cdot9}{55\\cdot5}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{05}$ to a fraction. Let's define $x=0.\\overline{05}$. If we multiply both sides by $100$ we get $100x=5.\\overline{05}$ so $99x=5$ and $x=0.\\overline{05}=\\frac{5}{99}$. Since $1.8=\\frac{9}{5}$ we get  $$\\frac{\\cancel{5}}{99}\\cdot\\frac{9}{\\cancel{5}}=\\frac{9}{99}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{11}}.$$"
