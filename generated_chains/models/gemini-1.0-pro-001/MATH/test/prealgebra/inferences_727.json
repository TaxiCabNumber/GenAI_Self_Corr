At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many numbers from 1 through 200 have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4?",
        "inference": "1. First, we need to find all the numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units place. To do this, we can divide 200 by 10, which gives us 20. This means that there are 20 multiples of 10 from 1 to 200, which are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, and 200.\n\n2. Next, we need to find all the numbers from 1 through 200 that are divisible by 4. To do this, we can divide 200 by 4, which gives us 50. This means that there are 50 multiples of 4 from 1 to 200, which are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 144, 148, 152, 156, 160, 164, 168, 172, 176, 180, 184, 188, 192, 196, and 200.\n\n3. Finally, we need to find all the numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4. To do this, we can look at the list of numbers that have a 2 in the units place and the list of numbers that are divisible by 4, and find the numbers that are common to both lists. The common numbers are 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 84, 92, 100, 108, 116, 124, 132, 140, 148, 156, 164, 172, 180, 188, and 196.\n\n4. Therefore, there are 25 numbers from 1 through 200 that have a 2 in the units place and are divisible by 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{25}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\\boxed{10}$."
