At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCheldelin Middle School has 12 doors to enter or leave the building. In how many ways is it possible to enter the building by one door and leave the building by a different door?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways to enter the building.  There are 12 doors to enter the building, so there are 12 ways to enter the building.  \n**Step 2:** Determine the number of ways to leave the building. There are 12 doors to leave the building, so there are 12 ways to leave the building.  \n**Step 3:** Determine the number of ways to enter and leave the building by different doors. To enter and leave the building by different doors, we need to multiply the number of ways to enter the building by the number of ways to leave the building. So, there are 12 * 12 = 144 ways to enter and leave the building by different doors.  \n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$144$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "You can enter the building through one of 12 different doors. Since only that door is eliminated from the doors for you to exit, there are 11 choices for the exit door. So the total number of ordered pairs of enter, exit doors is $12 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{132}$."
