At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 25 members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer.  In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members may hold more than one office?",

After the president and secretary are chosen, there are 23 ways to choose the treasurer.  Therefore, there are $25\\times 24\\times 23 = 13,800$ ways to choose the officers.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13,800}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 25 choices for each position, so there are $25\\times 25\\times 25=\\boxed{15,\\!625}$ ways that the positions can be filled."
