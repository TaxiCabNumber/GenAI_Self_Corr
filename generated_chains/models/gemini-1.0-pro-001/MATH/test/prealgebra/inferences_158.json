        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJim and Martha are standing together at the corner of a rectangular field. Jim walks diagonally across the field. Martha gets to the same location by walking along its length and width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. How many feet less than Martha does Jim walk?",
        "inference": "Martha has $(300^2 + 400^2)^{1/2}$ or 500 feet to walk. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, Jim has $\\sqrt{300^2+400^2}$ or 500 feet to walk as well.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The diagonal of the field is $\\sqrt{300^2+400^2}=500$ feet long so Jim walks 500 feet. Two adjacent sides of the field are $300+400=700$ feet long so Martha walks 700 feet. Jim walks $700-500=\\boxed{200}$ feet less than Martha."
