At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA square piece of paper is folded once so that one pair of opposite corners coincide. When the paper is unfolded, two congruent triangles have been formed. Given that the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, what is the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "The area of a square is $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. Since the area of the original square is $49$ square inches, we have $s^2 = 49$. Therefore, $s = 7$ inches.\n\nWhen the square is folded in half, it forms two congruent triangles with base $s$ and height $s$. The area of a triangle is $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. Since the area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}s^2$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}s^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(7)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(49) = 24.5$.\n\nThe perimeter of a triangle is $P = b + 2h$. Since the base of each triangle is $s = 7$ inches and the height is also $s = 7$ inches, we have $P = 7 + 2(7) = 7 + 14 = 21$.\n\nTherefore, the number of inches in the perimeter of one of these triangles is $21$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{21}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{14+7\\sqrt{2}}$."
