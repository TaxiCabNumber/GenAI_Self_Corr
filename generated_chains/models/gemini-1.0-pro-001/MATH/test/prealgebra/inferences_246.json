At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo fair 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability the sum rolled is 9?",
        "inference": "There are 36 possible outcomes when two fair 6-sided dice are rolled. The sum of the numbers on the dice can be any number from 2 to 12. The sum is 9 in four of the 36 outcomes: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (6, 3). \n\nThe probability of rolling a sum of 9 is 4/36, which simplifies to 1/9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/9}$. I hope it is correct.",
