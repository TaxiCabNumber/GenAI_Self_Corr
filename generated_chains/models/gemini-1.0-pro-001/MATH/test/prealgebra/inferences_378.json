        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different prime factors are in the prime factorization of $117\\cdot119$?",
        "inference": "Since 117 = 3 * 39 and 39 = 3 * 13, the prime factorization of 117 is 3 * 3 * 13.\nSince 119 = 7 * 17, the prime factorization of 119 is 7 * 17.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 117 * 119 is 3 * 3 * 13 * 7 * 17, which has 5 different prime factors.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed5. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Both these numbers look like they could be primes, but are actually not. $117=3^2\\cdot13$, and $119=7\\cdot17$. That gives $\\boxed{4}$ distinct primes in the prime factorization."
