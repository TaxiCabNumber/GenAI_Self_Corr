        "inference": "The shared side $\\overline{AD}$ is a side of both the regular pentagon and the regular hexagon. In the pentagon, since the angle sum is $540\\degree$, each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{540\\degree}{5}=108\\degree$. In the hexagon, since the angle sum is $720\\degree$, each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{720\\degree}{6}=120\\degree$. Therefore, the measure of angle $BAC$ is $120\\degree-108\\degree=\\boxed{12^\\circ}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The measure of each interior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $180(n-2)/n$ degrees.  Therefore, the measure of angle $\\angle BAD$ is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees and the measure of angle $CAD$ is 108 degrees.  Their difference, $\\angle BAC$, measures $120-108=\\boxed{12\\text{ degrees}}$."
