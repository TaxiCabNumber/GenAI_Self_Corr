At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have twenty balls numbered 1 through 20 in a bin.  In how many ways can I select 2 balls, if the order in which I draw them doesn't matter?",
        "inference": "First, calculate the number of ways to select 2 balls from 20 balls without regard to order. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is: $$C(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$ where: n is the total number of items r is the number of items to select So, in this case: $$C(20,2) = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2!18!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2} = 190$$\n\nTherefore, there are 190 ways to select 2 balls from 20 balls without regard to order.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{190}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the order the balls are selected matters, there are 20 choices for the first selection and 19 choices for the second selection.  However, $20\\cdot 19$ counts each pair of balls twice, once for each possible order in which they can be selected.  So, we must divide by $2$, , to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2} = \\boxed{190}$."
