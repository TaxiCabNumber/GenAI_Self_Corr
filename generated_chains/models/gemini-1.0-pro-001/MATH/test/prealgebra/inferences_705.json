There are 4 ways to choose a Queen, and there are 13 ways to choose a $\\diamondsuit$, but the outcomes are not mutually exclusive!  We might choose the Queen of $\\diamondsuit$, which belongs to both outcomes.  So we must subtract one to correct for this overcounting.  Thus are are $17-1 = 16$ successful outcomes, and the probability is $\\frac{16}{52} =\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}$."
