        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKent won $25\\%$ of the games he played on Saturday. If he lost 12 games on Saturday, and no game ended in a tie, how many games did he win?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $x$ be the number of games Kent played on Saturday. Then, the number of games he won is $0.25x$. Since he lost 12 games, we have:\n\n$$0.25x + 12 = x$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$0.75x = 12$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{12}{0.75} = \\frac{12 \\times 4}{3} = 16$$\n\nTherefore, Kent played a total of $16$ games on Saturday.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Kent won $25\\%$ of the games, he lost $75\\%$ of them.  Thus if $g$ is the total number of games he played,\n\n$$12=0.75(g)\\Rightarrow g=16$$\n\nSo the number of games he won was $16-12=\\boxed{4}$."
