At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA class of 30 students recently took a test.  If 20 students scored 80, 8 students scored 90, and 2 students scored 100, then what was the class average (the mean) on this test?",

Divide the total number of points awarded by the number of students.\n$$2520 / 30 = 84$$\n\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{84}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "From the given information, the total amount of marks obtained by the class is   $$20(80)+8(90)+2(100)=2520.$$Therefore, the class average is  $$\\frac{2520}{30} = \\boxed{84}.$$"
