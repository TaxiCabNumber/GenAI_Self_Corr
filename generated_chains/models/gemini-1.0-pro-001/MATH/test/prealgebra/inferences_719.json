At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe mean of four distinct positive integers is 5. If the largest of these four integers is 13, what is the smallest of the four integers?",
        "inference": "Mean = Sum of n numbers/n\nSo, 5 = (a + b + c + 13)/4\n=> a + b + c = 7\nWhere a, b, and c are distinct positive integers.\nSo, the possible values of (a, b, c) are (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), (2, 2, 3).\nOut of these, only (1, 2, 4) satisfies the condition that they are distinct.\nHence, the smallest integer of the four integers is 1.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the four distinct positive integers be $a$, $b$, $c$, and 13, with $a<b<c<13$. We have the equation $\\frac{a+b+c+13}{4}=5\\Rightarrow a+b+c=7$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be positive and distinct, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=4$. So the smallest integer is $\\boxed{1}$."
