        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe only garments that a particular factory produces are  dresses and shirts. It produces three\tdresses for every five shirts  it makes. If the factory produced a total of 72 garments today,  how many dresses did it make?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of shirts as x.\n\nAccording to the given ratio, for every 5 shirts, the factory produces 3 dresses. So, the number of dresses produced can be expressed as (3/5) * x.\n\nGiven that the total number of garments produced is 72, we have:\n\nx + (3/5) * x = 72\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(8/5) * x = 72\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 72 * (5/8)\n\nx = 45\n\nTherefore, the number of shirts produced is 45.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of dresses produced:\n\nNumber of dresses = (3/5) * x\n\nSubstituting x = 45:\n\nNumber of dresses = (3/5) * 45\n\nNumber of dresses = 27\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{27}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the factory produces 3 dresses for every 5 shirts, that means it produces 3 dresses out of every 8 garments. So we multiply the fraction $\\frac{3}{8}$ by the number of garments, 72, and get $\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot72=3\\cdot9=\\boxed{27}$ dresses."
