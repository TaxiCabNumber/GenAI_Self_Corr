At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor each of 8 colors, I have one shirt and one tie of that color.  How many shirt-and-tie outfits can I make if I refuse to wear a shirt and a tie of the same color?",

        "ground_truth": "There are 8 options for the shirt, and only 7 options for the tie because one of the ties has the same color as the shirt, so the number of outfits is $8 \\times 7 = \\boxed{56}$."
