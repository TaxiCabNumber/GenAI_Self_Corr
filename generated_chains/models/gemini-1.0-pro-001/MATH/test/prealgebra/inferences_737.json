At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the least positive integer divisible by each of the first five composite numbers?",

The least positive integer divisible by each of these numbers must have all of these prime factors.\n4. The prime factors of the least positive integer divisible by each of the first five composite numbers are 2, 3, and 5.\n5. The least positive integer with these prime factors is 30.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$30$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first five composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. Their prime factorizations are $2^2, 2\\cdot 3, 2^3, 3^2$, and $2\\cdot 5$. Taking the maximum exponent for each prime, we find that the least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5=\\boxed{360}$."
