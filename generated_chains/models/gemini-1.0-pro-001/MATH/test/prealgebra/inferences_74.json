        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a certain number is multiplied by five, the result is the  same as twenty-one plus twice the original number.  What is the value of the original number?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Let the original number be $x$.**\n\n**Step 2: Translate the given information into an equation:** \nSince the number multiplied by 5 is the same as twenty-one plus twice the original number, we have:\n$$5x = 21 + 2x$$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation for $x$.**\nSubtract $2x$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$5x - 2x = 21 + 2x - 2x$$\nSimplifying:\n$$3x = 21$$\n\n**Divide both sides by $3$:**\n$$x = \\frac{21}{3} = 7$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number be $x$. We know that $5x=2x+21$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $3x=21$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 gives $x=\\boxed{7}$."
