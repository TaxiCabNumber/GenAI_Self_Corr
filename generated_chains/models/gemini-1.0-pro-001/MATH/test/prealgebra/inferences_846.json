At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA number is selected at random from 1 through 100, inclusive.  What is the probability that the number is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the number of perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\nThe perfect squares between 1 and 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. So there are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability that a number chosen at random from 1 to 100 is a perfect square.\n\nThe probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 10 (the number of perfect squares between 1 and 100), and the total number of possible outcomes is 100. So the probability that a number chosen at random from 1 to 100 is a perfect square is 10/100 = 1/10.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1/10}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 100 numbers possible between 1 and 100. There are 10 perfect squares between 1 and 100: $1^2,2^2,\\ldots,10^2$.  So the probability that a randomly selected number is a perfect square is $\\dfrac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{10}}$."
