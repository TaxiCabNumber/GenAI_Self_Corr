At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of dogs to cats at the pound is $4:3$. How many dogs were at the pound if a total of 280 dogs and cats were at the pound?",
        "inference": "Let $c$ be the number of cats at the pound.\n\nSince the ratio of dogs to cats is $4:3$, the number of dogs at the pound is $\\frac{4}{3}c$.\n\nThe total number of dogs and cats at the pound is 280, so we have$$\\frac{4}{3}c+c=280$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get$$c=84$$\n\nTherefore, the number of dogs at the pound is $\\frac{4}{3}c=\\frac{4}{3}(84)=\\boxed{112}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{112}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $4x$ be the number of dogs and $3x$ be the number of cats. Then $4x + 3x = 280$, or $7x = 280$. Solving, we get $x = 40$. Thus, the number of dogs is $4x = 4(40) = \\boxed{160}$."
