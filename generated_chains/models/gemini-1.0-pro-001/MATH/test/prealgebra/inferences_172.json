At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSquare tiles measuring 4 inches on each side will be used to tile a 1-foot by 1-foot area. How many of these tiles are needed?",
        "inference": "- To cover 1 square foot, you need to divide the area of the square into the area of a single tile:\n$$Area_{square} = 1 foot \\times 1 foot = 144 in^2$$\n$$Area_{tile} = 4 in \\times 4 in = 16 in^2$$\n$$\\frac{Area_{square}}{Area_{tile}} = \\frac{144 in^2}{16 in^2} = 9$$\n\n- Thus, 9 tiles would be required to cover the square area.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A 1-foot by 1-foot area is 12 inches by 12 inches. Thus, there need to be three tiles on each side of this area. The total number of tiles is then $3\\cdot3=\\boxed{9}$ tiles."
