        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMax must take 10 steps to go the same distance as three of his dad's steps. His dad takes 30 steps to walk down the hall. How many steps must Max take to walk down the same hall?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the ratio of Max's steps to his dad's steps.\nRatio = Max's steps / Dad's steps = 10 / 3\n\n2. Multiply the ratio by the number of his dad's steps to find the number of steps Max must take.\nNumber of Max's steps = Ratio * Dad's steps\n= (10 / 3) * 30\n\n3. Simplify the expression to find the final answer.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using the given information, we have the ratio $10 \\text{ Max steps} : 3 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Multiplying both sides by $10$, we get the ratio $100 \\text{ Max steps} : 30 \\text{ Dad steps}$. Thus, $30$ of his dad's steps are the same as $\\boxed{100}$ of his steps."
