At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number 1341 can be written as the sum of three consecutive positive integers. What is the largest of these integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be \\(x\\), \\(x+1\\), and \\(x+2\\). Then, we have:\n$$x+(x+1)+(x+2)=1341$$\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:\n$$3x+3=1341$$\n\nSubtracting 3 from both sides of the equation, we get:\n$$3x=1338$$\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:\n$$x=446$$\n\nTherefore, the largest of the three integers is \\(x+2=446+2=\\boxed{448}\\).\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$448$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the three integers be $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$.  We have  $$(n-1)+n+(n+1) = 1341,$$ so $3n=1341$, which gives $n=447$.\n\nThe largest of the three numbers is $n+1=\\boxed{448}$."
