        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup consisted of several groups of four teams each. Within each group, each of the four teams played each other once. How many matches were there in each group?",
        "inference": "* Each team plays every other team in its group, so there are $3$ matches per team.\n* There are $4$ teams in each group, so there are $4 \\times 3 = 12$ matches in each group.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since there were four teams in each group, they each must have played each other once, meaning that at first glance, there seem to be $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ pairs of teams. However, that counts each match twice, so we must divide by $2$ and we have $\\boxed{6},$ our answer."
