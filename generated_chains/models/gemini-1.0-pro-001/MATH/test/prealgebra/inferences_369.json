        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn parallelogram $PQRS$, the measure of angle $P$ is five times the measure of angle $Q$. What is the measure of angle $R$, in degrees?",
        "inference": "For parallelograms, the opposite angles are congruent, so $\\angle P = \\angle S$ and $\\angle Q = \\angle R$. Also, since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, $\\angle P + \\angle Q + \\angle R + \\angle S = 360^\\circ$. Thus, $5\\angle Q + \\angle Q + 5\\angle Q + \\angle Q = 360^\\circ$, so $12\\angle Q = 360^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle Q = 30^\\circ$, and by congruence, $\\boxed{\\angle R = 30^\\circ}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, while opposite angles are equal.  So $P + Q = 180 = 5Q + Q$, implying that $Q = 30$.  Thus $P = \\boxed{150} = R$, and we are done."
