At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Solution:\nThe largest positive multiple of $9$ less than $1000$ is $999$.\nThe smallest positive multiple of $9$ less than $1000$ is $9$.\nThe number of positive multiples of $9$ less than $1000$ is $\\frac{999-9}{9}+1=\\frac{990}{9}+1=111$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{111}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we'll find the largest multiple of $9$ less than $1000$.  Because $1000 \\div 9 = 111$ remainder 1, the largest multiple of $9$ less than $1000$ is $111 \\cdot 9$, or $999$.\n\nTherefore, every number in the form $n \\cdot 9$ works, as long as $n$ is positive and at most $111$.  There are $111$ such values of $n$, so there are $\\boxed{111}$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $1000$."
