        "inference": "Step 1: Let x be the amount of Carla's savings. Step 2: She spent two-fifths of her savings, so she spent 2/5 * x = 2x/5 on the bracelet. Step 3: She had $\\$9 left over, so we can write an equation: \n2x/5 = x - 9\nStep 4: Solve for x by multiplying both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction:\n5 * 2x/5 = 5 * (x - 9)\n2x = 5x - 45\nStep 5: Solve for x:\n2x - 5x = -45\n-3x = -45\nx = 15\nStep 6: Replace x with 15 to find the amount she spent on the bracelet:\n2x/5 = 2 * 15 / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$6}.
