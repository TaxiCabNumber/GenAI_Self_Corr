At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn my neighborhood, there are six streets. There are 10 houses on each side of each street. No house faces two different streets. How many houses are in my neighborhood?",
