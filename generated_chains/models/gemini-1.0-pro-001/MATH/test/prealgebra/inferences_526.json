At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of all the positive two-digit integers where one of the digits is four times the other?",
        "inference": "Let x be the smaller digit and 4x be the larger digit. Then the two-digit integer is 10x + 4x = 14x. Since x is a positive integer, 14x must be a positive two-digit integer. The smallest positive two-digit integer is 10, so x must be at least 1. The largest positive two-digit integer is 99, so x must be at most 7. Therefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The sum of all the positive two-digit integers where one of the digits is four times the other is:\n$$14(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) = 14(28) = 392.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{392}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The only such possible two-digit integers will be composed with either a 1 and a 4 or a 2 and an 8. So, we simply want to compute $14+41+28+82$. Adding the first two and the last two in pairs gives $55 + 110$, which is easily computed to be $\\boxed{165}$."
