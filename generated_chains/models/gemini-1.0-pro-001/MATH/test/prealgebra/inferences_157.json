        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many sides would there be in a convex polygon if the sum of all but one of its interior angles is $1070^{\\circ}$?",
        "inference": "The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n - 2)^{\\circ}$. So, if the sum of all but one of the interior angles of a convex polygon is $1070^{\\circ}$, then the sum of all of the interior angles is $1070^{\\circ} + 180^{\\circ} = 1250^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the number of sides in the polygon is $n = \\frac{1250^{\\circ}}{180^{\\circ}} + 2 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\\circ$.\n\nTo see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\\circ - 1070^\\circ = 190^\\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\\circ$."
