At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many interior diagonals does a regular nine-sided polygon have?  (An $\\emph{interior diagonal }$ is a segment connecting two vertices which do not have an edge between them.)",
        "inference": "A regular nine-sided polygon has $9$ vertices.  We can choose $2$ vertices out of $9$ in $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ ways.  But for each choice, there are $2$ possible diagonals since the segment can go either way between the $2$ vertices.  Thus, the number of interior diagonals is $2\\binom{9}{2}=2\\cdot 36=72$. \n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$72$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 9 vertices in the polygon, so from each vertex there are potentially 8 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 2 of these 8 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $9 \\times 6 = 54$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\\dfrac{9\\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{27}$ diagonals."
