I hope it is correct.'\nThe integer 49 can be written as the sum of smaller perfect squares in a variety of ways. One such way includes six terms: $25 + 9 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1$. If each term has a value between 0 and 49, what is the fewest number of perfect square terms smaller than 49 that can be added together for a sum of 49?",
        "inference": "The prime factorization of $49$ is $49 = 7^2$. Since $49$ is an odd perfect square, the sum of perfect squares that add up to $49$ must contain an odd number of terms. \n\nThe largest perfect square less than $49$ is $25$, so the sum must contain at least two terms. \n\nThe next largest perfect square is $16$. If the sum contains two terms, they must be $25$ and $24$. However, $24$ is not a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the sum must contain at least three terms. \n\nThe next largest perfect square is $9$. If the sum contains three terms, they must be $25$, $16$, and $8$. However, $8$ is not a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, the sum must contain at least four terms. \n\nThe next largest perfect square is $4$. If the sum contains four terms, they must be $25$, $16$, $4$, and $4$. However, this is not a valid sum because it contains a repeated term. \n\nTherefore, the sum must contain at least five terms. \n\nThe only remaining perfect square less than $49$ is $1$. If the sum contains five terms, they must be $25$, $16$, $4$, $1$, and $3$. This is a valid sum because it contains five distinct terms and it adds up to $49$. \n\nTherefore, the fewest number of perfect square terms smaller than $49$ that can be added together for a sum of $49$ is $\\boxed{5}.$",
