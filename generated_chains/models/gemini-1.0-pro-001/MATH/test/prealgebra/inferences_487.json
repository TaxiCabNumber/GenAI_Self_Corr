        "inference": "A diagonal of square $PQRS$ is a line segment joining $P$ and $S$.  Since $P$ is folded onto $R$ and $Q$ is folded onto $S$, the diagonal $PS$ is the axis of symmetry of the resulting figure, which is a parallelogram.  The area of a parallelogram is half the product of its base and height.  The base of the parallelogram is the diagonal $PS$ and its height is the width of the parallelogram, which is $9$ inches.  Since the area of the parallelogram is $9$ square inches, the length of the diagonal $PS$ is $2 \\cdot 9 / 9 = 2$ inches.  The perimeter of square $PQRS$ is $4$ times the length of a side of the square, so the perimeter of square $PQRS$ is $4 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{8}.$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After folding the square twice the resulting figure is isosceles triangle with area 9 square inches. Since there are 4 such congruent triangles in the square, the area of the square is 36 square inches. Therefore, the sides of $PQRS$ are 6 inches, and the perimeter is $\\boxed{24}$ inches."
