At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt 3:20, what is the measure in degrees of the lesser angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand?",
        "inference": "The hour and minute hands of a clock are 12 hours or 720 degrees apart at 12:00.\n\nIn 3 hours and 20 minutes, the minute hand moves 20/60 * 360 = 120 degrees.\n\nThe hour hand moves 3/12 * 360 + 20/60 * 30 = 90 + 10 = 100 degrees.\n\nThe difference between the positions of the two hands is 120 - 100 = 20 degrees.\n\nThe lesser angle is half of this difference, or 10 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At 3:20, the minute hand is at the 4, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock, therefore, $120$ degrees from the top.  The hour hand, at the beginning of the hour, started at the 3, but since we are $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way through the hour, the hour hand will have traveled $\\frac{1}{3}$ the arc from 3 to 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is another 10 degrees further clockwise, meaning the measure of the angle between the two hands is $120 - 100 = \\boxed{20\\text{ degrees}}$."
