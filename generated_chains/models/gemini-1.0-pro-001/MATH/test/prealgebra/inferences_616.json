At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Marika bought her house she paid $80\\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house?",
        "inference": "Let the purchase price of the house be $x$. \n\nThen, $80\\%$ of the purchase price is $0.8x$. \n\nSince she paid the remaining $\\$49,400$ with her savings, we have:\n\n$$0.8x + 49,400 = x$$ \n\nSimplifying: \n\n$$ 0.2x  = 49,400 $$ \n\n$$x  = 49,400 / 0.2$$ \n\n$$x  = 247,000$$ \n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$247,000$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since she paid $80\\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \\rightarrow x = \\boxed{247000}$."
