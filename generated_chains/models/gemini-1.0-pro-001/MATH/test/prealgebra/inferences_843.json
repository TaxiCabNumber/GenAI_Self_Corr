At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of five numbers is $10.6$. Four of the numbers are 10, 4, 5 and 20. What is the value of the fifth number?",
        "inference": "Let x be the fifth number. Then the sum of the five numbers is $10 \\times 4 + x = 40 + x$. Since the average of the five numbers is 10.6, we have\n\n$$\\frac{40 + x}{5} = 10.6.$$\n\nSolving for x, we get\n\n$$40 + x = 53,$$\n\n$$x = 53 - 40,$$\n\n$$x = 13.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the numbers is $5(10.6)=53$.  The sum of the four given numbers is $10+4+5+20=39$.  So the fifth number is $53-39=\\boxed{14}$."
