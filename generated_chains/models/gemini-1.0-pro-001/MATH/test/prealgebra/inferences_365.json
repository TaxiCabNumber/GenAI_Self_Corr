At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nChris and Nathan order a giant cookie together. If Chris eats $\\frac{2}{7}$ of the cookie and Nathan eats $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the cookie, what fraction of the original cookie is left?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total amount of cookie eaten by both Chris and Nathan.\n\n$\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{10}{35} + \\frac{21}{35} = \\frac{31}{35}$\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract the amount eaten from 1 to find the fraction of the cookie left.\n\n$1 - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{4}{35}$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{35}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The total amount eaten is $\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{5}$. The denominators have a common multiple of 35, so this is equivalent to $\\frac{10}{35} + \\frac{21}{35} = \\frac{10 + 21}{35} = \\frac{31}{35}$. Thus, the amount that Chris and Nathan didn't eat is $1 - \\frac{31}{35} = \\frac{35}{35} - \\frac{31}{35} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{35}}.$"
