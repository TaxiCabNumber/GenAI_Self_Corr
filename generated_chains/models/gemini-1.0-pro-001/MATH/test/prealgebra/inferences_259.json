At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 500 are equal to 5 times an even integer?",
        "inference": "The even multiples of 5 up to 500 are 10, 20, 30, 40, ..., 490. \nThere are (490 - 10) / 10 + 1 = 50 even multiples of 5 up to 500. \n\nSince each of these even multiples is equal to 5 times an even integer, there are 50 positive integers less than 500 that are equal to 5 times an even integer.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{50}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "An even integer is a multiple of 2. The integers we are looking for are multiples of 2 and 5, so they are multiples of 10. The largest multiple of 10 less than 500 is $490 = 49 \\cdot 10$, and the smallest positive multiple of 10 is $10 = 1 \\cdot 10$. Our list also includes every multiple of 10 between 10 and 490, so there are a total of $\\boxed{49}$ positive integers less than 500 that are equal to 5 times an even integer."
