From 2 to 3, it moves $\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the way around the clock. \nIn the 48 minutes past 2, it moves an additional $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac{4}{5}$ of the way from 2 to 3. \nTherefore, the hour hand is at $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{11}{30}$ of the way around the clock from 2.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the minute hand's position at 2:48pm. \nAt 2:48pm, the minute hand has moved 48 minutes out of 60, or $\\frac{48}{60} = \\frac{4}{5}$ of the way around the clock.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand. \nThis angle is given by the difference between the positions of the two hands:\n$$\\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{11}{30} = \\frac{24}{30} - \\frac{11}{30} = \\frac{13}{30} \\text{ of the way around the clock}.$$\n\n**Step 4:** Convert the fraction of the way around the clock to degrees. \nThe circumference of a circle is $2\\pi$ radians, which is $360^\\circ$. \nTherefore, $\\frac{13}{30}$ of the way around the clock is $\\frac{13}{30} \\cdot 360^\\circ = \\frac{2340^\\circ}{30} = 78^\\circ$.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{78^\\circ}$.

At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.
