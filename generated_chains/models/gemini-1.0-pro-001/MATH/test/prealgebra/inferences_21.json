        "inference": "First, we need to find out the number of stamps Juan has in the $70\\text{'s}$. We can do this by adding up the number of stamps from each country in the $70\\text{'s}$.

We can do this by multiplying the number of stamps from each country by the price of the stamps from that country and then adding up the results.
