        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of hours elapsed since midnight.\n\n- 4:20 a.m. can be written as 4 hours and 20 minutes after midnight.\n- Convert 20 minutes to hours: 20 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1/3 hour.\n- Total hours elapsed since midnight: 4 + 1/3 = 13/3 hours.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the fraction of a full 12-hour cycle that has passed.\n\n- 12-hour cycle = 360 degrees.\n- Fraction of cycle passed: 13/3 hours / 12 hours = 13/36.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the angle formed by the minute hand.\n\n- The minute hand makes one complete revolution (360 degrees) in 60 minutes.\n- The minute hand has moved 20 minutes, which is 20/60 = 1/3 of an hour.\n- Angle formed by minute hand: (1/3) * 360 degrees = 120 degrees.\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the angle formed by the hour hand.\n\n- The hour hand makes one complete revolution (360 degrees) in 12 hours.\n- The hour hand has moved 13/3 hours.\n- Angle formed by hour hand: (13/36) * 360 degrees = 143.33 degrees.\n\n**Step 5:** Calculate the acute angle between the hands.\n\n- The acute angle is the difference between the angles formed by the minute and hour hands.\n- Acute angle: 143.33 degrees - 120 degrees = 23.33 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{23.33}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "As the minute hand moves $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way around the clock face from 12 to 4, the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the way from 4 to 5.  So the hour hand will move $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $\\frac{1}{12}$ of $360^\\circ$, or $\\boxed{10^\\circ}$."
