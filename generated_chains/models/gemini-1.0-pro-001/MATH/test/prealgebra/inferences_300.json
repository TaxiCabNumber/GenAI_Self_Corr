        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAnswer each of the following questions yes or no, and add up the numbers corresponding to the questions for which the answer is yes. For instance, if the answer to all six questions were 'yes,' then the answer would be $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$.\n\n1. Is $\\frac{2}{3x}$ equivalent to $\\frac{2x}{3}$?\n\n2. Is $\\frac{1-h}{2h}$ equivalent to $\\frac{h-1}{2h}$?\n\n3. Is $-(u+u^2)$ equivalent to $-u-u^2$?\n\n4. Is $-(3+y)$ equivalent to $-3+y$?\n\n5. Is $\\frac{j}{2}$ equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}j$?\n\n6. Is $x+y+z$ equivalent to $y+x+z$?",
        "inference": "1. $2/3x$ = $2x/3$ incorrect.\n\n2. $(1-h)/2h$ = $(h-1)/2h$ incorrect.\n\n3. $-(u+u^2)$ = $-u-u^2$ correct.\n\n4. $-(3+y)$ = $-3+y$ incorrect.\n\n5. $j/2$ = $1/2j$ correct.\n\n6. $x+y+z$ = $y+x+z$ correct.\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that two expressions are equivalent if they are equal for all valid choices of the variable or variables involved.\n\nQuestion 1:  no, because the given expressions are equal only for certain values of $x$. Almost any $x$ will do: take $x=2$ and note that $\\frac{2}{3(2)}=\\frac{1}{3}$ while $\\frac{2(2)}{3}=\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 2: no, because the second expression is $-1$ times the first expression. Thus they are only equal if each of them happens to equal 0. For example, if $h=3$, then $\\frac{1-h}{2h}=\\frac{1-3}{2(3)}=\\frac{-2}{6}=-\\frac{1}{3}$, while $\\frac{h-1}{2h} = \\frac{3-1}{2(3)} = \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nQuestion 3: yes, because we obtain the second expression by distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in the first expression.\n\nQuestion 4: no, because the negative sign has not been properly distributed. To confirm that the expressions are not equivalent, we can choose a value like $y=3$ to find that the first expression becomes $-(3+3)=-6$ while the second expression is $-3+3=0$.\n\nQuestion 5: yes, because we can multiply $\\frac{1}{2}$ by $j$ in the usual way by writing $j$ as $\\frac{j}{1}$. We get \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}j = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{j}{1} = \\frac{1\\cdot j}{2\\cdot 1} = \\frac{j}{2}.\n\\]\n\nQuestion 6: yes, by the commutative property of addition.\n\nThe questions whose answers are yes are 3, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is $\\boxed{14}$."
