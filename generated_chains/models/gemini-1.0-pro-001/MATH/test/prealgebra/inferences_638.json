At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTrae is searching for a treasure on the beach. From point $A$, he is told to walk two meters north, three meters east, and then two meters north to point $B$. In meters, what is the length of $\\overline{AB}$?",
        "inference": "If Trae walks two meters north, three meters east, and then two meters north, we can see that he forms a right triangle. The length of $\\overline{AB}$ is the hypotenuse of this triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = AB$.\n\n$2^2 + 3^2 = AB^2$\n$4 + 9 = AB^2$\n$13 = AB^2$\n$AB = \\sqrt{13}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In total, Trae walked 4 meters north and 3 meters east to get from point $A$ to point $B$. Since 3-4-5 is a Pythagorean triple, the length of $\\overline{AB} = \\boxed{5}$."
