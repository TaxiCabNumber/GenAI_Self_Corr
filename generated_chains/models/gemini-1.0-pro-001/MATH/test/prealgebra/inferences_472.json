I hope it is correct.'\nRemmy wants to divide $10$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$, but he cannot remember how to do that.  By what number should he multiply $10$ to get the answer?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nTo divide $10$ by $\\frac{2}{3}$, we need to multiply $10$ by the reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, we need to multiply $10$ by $\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nMultiplying by $\\frac{3}{2}$ is the same as multiplying by $3$ and dividing by $2$.\n\nTherefore, we can multiply $10$ by $3$ and divide the result by $2$.\n\n$10 \\cdot 3 = 30$\n\n$30 \\div 2 = 15$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{15}$.

        "ground_truth": "Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction.  The reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$, so that is what Remmy should multiply by."
