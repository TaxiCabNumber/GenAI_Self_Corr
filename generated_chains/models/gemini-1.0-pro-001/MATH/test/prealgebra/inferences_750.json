        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $N$ be the units digit of the number $21420N$. Which nonzero value of $N$ makes this number divisible by $6$?",
        "inference": "The units digit of a number is divisible by $6$ if it is $0$ or $6$. Therefore, we must have $N = 0$ or $N = 6$. Since $N$ is nonzero, we have $N = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number $21420N$ is divisible by $6$ if and only if it is even and the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. So $N$ must be even, and $2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N$ must be divisible by $3$.  Since $9$ is divisible by $3$, we see that $N$ must also be divisible by $3$. The only digit that works is $N = \\boxed{6}$."
