At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that they all come up heads?",
        "inference": "There are two possible outcomes for each coin: heads or tails. Therefore, there are \\(2^4=16\\) possible outcomes for the four coins. The only outcome that has all four coins coming up heads is HHHH. Therefore, the probability of getting all heads is \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\).\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). There is only 1 way that they can all come up heads, so the probability of this is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{16}}$."
