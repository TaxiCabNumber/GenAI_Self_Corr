        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the largest integer that is a solution of $13x + 8 < 35$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n$$\\begin{align*} 13x + 8 & < 35\\\\ 13x & <27\\\\ x & < \\frac{27}{13} \\approx 2.08 \\end{align*}$$\n\nThe largest integer less than 2.08 is 2.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Subtracting $8$ from both sides of the inequality, we have $$13x < 27.$$ Dividing both sides by $13$ gives $$x < \\frac{27}{13}.$$ Writing this in terms of mixed numbers, we have $$x < 2\\frac1{13}.$$ The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $x=\\boxed{2}$."
