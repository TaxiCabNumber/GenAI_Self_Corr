At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe angle measures of the three angles of a triangle are in the ratio $1:3:6$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the largest angle?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the smallest angle. Then the other two angles are $3x$ and $6x$. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$, we have:\n\n$$x+3x+6x=180^{\\circ}$$ $$10x=180^{\\circ}$$ $$x=18^{\\circ}$$\n\nTherefore, the largest angle is $6x=6\\cdot18^{\\circ}=\\boxed{108^{\\circ}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{108^{\\circ}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the angle measures are in the ratio $1:3:6$, the angle measures are $x$, $3x$, and $6x$ for some value of $x$.  Because the angles of a triangle add to $180^\\circ$, we have $x+3x+6x = 180^\\circ$, so $10x = 180^\\circ$ and $x =18^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $6x = \\boxed{108^\\circ}$."
