At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe owners of a house that is assessed at $\\$120,\\!000$ pay $\\$3,\\!000$ in taxes. At the same rate, what is the tax, in dollars, for a house assessed at $\\$160,\\!000$?",
        "inference": "- Let $x$ be the tax for the house assessed at $\\$160,000$.\n- Since the tax is proportional to the assessed value, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{160000}=\\frac{3000}{120000}$$\n\n- Solving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x=\\frac{3000\\times160000}{120000}$$\n\n$$x=4000$$\n\n- Final Answer: \\boxed{$4,000$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The value of the $\\$160,\\!000$ house is $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the value of the $\\$120,\\!000$ house, so the tax is $\\frac{4}{3}$ as great as well: $\\$3,\\!000\\cdot\\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{\\$4,\\!000}$."
