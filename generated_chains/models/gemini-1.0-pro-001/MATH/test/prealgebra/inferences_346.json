At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen 700 students from Genius M.S. played SCOOZ, 90$\\%$ of them scored ''proficient or above.'' What number of students at Genius M.S. did not score ''proficient or above?''",
        "inference": "1. Convert 90% to a decimal: 90/100 = 0.9\n2. Multiply the total number of students by the decimal: 700 * 0.9 = 630\n3. Subtract the number of students who scored proficient or above from the total number of students: 700 - 630 = 70\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{70}. I hope it is correct.**",
