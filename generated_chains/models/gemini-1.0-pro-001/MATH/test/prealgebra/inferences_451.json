At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of three consecutive integers is 120. That product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. What is the largest of the three consecutive integers?",
        "inference": "Let the three consecutive integers be $x$, $x+1$, and $x+2$. Then, we have:\n$$x(x+1)(x+2)=120$$\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n$$x^3+3x^2+2x=120$$\n$$x^3+3x^2+2x-120=0$$\nWe can factor this as:\n$$(x+6)(x^2-6x+20)=0$$\nSince $x$ is an integer, we have $x+6=0$ or $x^2-6x+20=0$. Solving the first equation, we get $x=-6$. Solving the second equation, we get $x=3$ or $x=4$. The largest of these three integers is $4$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the integers $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Their mean is $n$; their product is $(n-1)(n)(n+1)=120$ and their product divided by their mean is $(n-1)(n+1)=24$. Dividing the first equation by the second, we get $n=5$. The largest of the three is $n+1=\\boxed{6}$."
