At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary completes a 15-mile race in 2.5 hours. What is her average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "1. **Convert the time to hours.**\n\n2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes\n\n2. **Divide the distance by the time (in hours) to find the average speed.**\n\nAverage speed = Distance \u00f7 Time\n\nAverage speed = 15 miles \u00f7 2.5 hours\n\nAverage speed = 6 miles per hour\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{6}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is total distance divided by time.  In this case, we divide 15 miles by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ hours to find an average speed of $15\\div \\frac{5}{2}=15\\cdot \\frac{2}{5}=\\boxed{6}$ miles per hour."
