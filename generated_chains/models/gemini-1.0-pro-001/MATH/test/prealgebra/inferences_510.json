At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integers $x$ do we have $\\frac14 < \\frac{x}{5} < \\frac23$?",
        "inference": "1. First, let's find the equivalent fraction of $\\frac14$ and $\\frac23$ in terms of the least common multiple of their denominators. For $\\frac14$, we get $\\frac{3}{12}$ and for $\\frac23$, we get $\\frac{8}{12}$.\n2. Now, the inequality $\\frac14 < \\frac{x}{5} < \\frac23$ becomes $\\frac{3}{12} < \\frac{x}{5} < \\frac{8}{12}$.\n3. Multiplying both sides by 60 (the least common multiple of 12 and 5) we get $15 < 12x < 40$.\n4. Dividing both sides by 12, we get $\\frac{15}{12} < x < \\frac{40}{12}$.\n5. Simplifying the fractions, we get $\\frac{5}{4} < x < \\frac{10}{3}$.\n6. Since $x$ is an integer, we check the values of $x$ for which $\\frac{5}{4} < x < \\frac{10}{3}$ holds. We get $x = 2, 3, 4$.\n7. Counting the number of integers that satisfy the inequality, we have 3 integers.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since we are looking for integer solutions, we should isolate $x$ by multiplying by 5.  This gives \\[1\\frac14<x<3\\frac13.\\]The only integers between $1\\frac14$ and $3\\frac13$ are 2 and 3.  Therefore there are $\\boxed{2}$ integers that solve this pair of inequalities."
