At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA card is drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that it is an odd number (3,5,7,9) or a $\\spadesuit$ (or both)?",
        "inference": "The deck has $4$ $\\spadesuit$ cards that are not odd and $12$ odd cards that are not $\\spadesuit$.  There are $4$ cards that are both odd and $\\spadesuit$.  So there are a total of $20$ cards that satisfy the condition.  The probability of drawing such a card is $\\frac{20}{52} = \\frac{5}{13}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{13}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 16 odd-numbered cards, namely 4 suits for each of the 4 odd digits. There are 13 $\\spadesuit$s, but 4 of these we already counted among the odd-numbered cards.  So the total number of cards that are odd or a $\\spadesuit$ is $16+(13-4)=25$, and the probability is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{25}{52}}$."
