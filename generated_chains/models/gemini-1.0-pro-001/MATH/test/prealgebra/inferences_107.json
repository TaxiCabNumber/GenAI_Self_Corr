        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of an equilateral triangle is $180\\degree$. Since there are three angles, each angle measures $180\\degree/3 = 60\\degree$.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a square is $360\\degree$. Since there are four angles, each angle measures $360\\degree/4 = 90\\degree$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of one interior angle of an equilateral triangle to one interior angle of a square is:\n\n$$\\frac{60\\degree}{90\\degree} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{2}{3}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "One interior angle of an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees while one interior angle of a square measures 90 degrees. The ratio is $60/90=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
