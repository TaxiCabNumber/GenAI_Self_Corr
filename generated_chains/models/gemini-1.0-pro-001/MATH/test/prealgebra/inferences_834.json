At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measures of the angles of a triangle are in a ratio of $3:5:7$. What is the degree measure of the largest angle?",
        "inference": "Let the measures of the angles be $3x$, $5x$, and $7x$.\nSince the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have\n\n$$3x+5x+7x=180^\\circ$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 15x=180^\\circ$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow x=12^\\circ$$\n\nTherefore, the largest angle is $7x=\\boxed{84^\\circ}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{84^\\circ}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $3k$ be the measure of the smallest angle.  Then the other two angles measure $5k$ and $7k$.  Since the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $3k+5k+7k=180^\\circ$, which implies $k=180^\\circ/15=12^\\circ$.  The largest angle is $7k=7(12^\\circ)=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
