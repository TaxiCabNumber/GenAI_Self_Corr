At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCharlie is riding on his unicycle. If the unicycle's wheel has a radius of 9 inches and makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, what is the unicycle's speed in inches per second?",
        "inference": "The circumference of the unicycle's wheel is:\n$$C = 2\\pi r = 2\\pi (9) = 18\\pi \\approx 56.55 \\text{ inches}$$\n\nSince the unicycle's wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, the unicycle's speed is:\n$$v = \\frac{C}{t} = \\frac{56.55}{3} \\approx 18.85 \\text{ inches per second}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18.85$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We need to know how many inches are in one revolution of the unicycle's wheel. In other words, we need to know the circumference of the wheel. Since the radius is $9$ inches, the circumference is $18\\pi$ inches. So, if there are $18\\pi$ inches in one revolution, and the wheel makes $2$ revolutions every $3$ seconds, the unicycle's speed is $18\\pi\\cdot\\frac{2}{3} = \\boxed{12\\pi}$ inches per second."
