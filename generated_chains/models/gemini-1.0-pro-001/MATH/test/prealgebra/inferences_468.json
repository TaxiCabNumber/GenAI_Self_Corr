At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different combinations of $\\$5$ bills and $\\$2$ bills can be used to make a total of $\\$17$?  Order does not matter in this problem.",

        "ground_truth": "Since the total $\\$17$ is odd, there must be an odd number of $\\$5$ bills.  One $\\$5$ bill plus six $\\$2$ bills is a solution, as is three $\\$5$ bills plus one $\\$2$ bill.  Five $\\$5$ bills exceeds $\\$17$, so these are the only $\\boxed{2}$ combinations that work."
