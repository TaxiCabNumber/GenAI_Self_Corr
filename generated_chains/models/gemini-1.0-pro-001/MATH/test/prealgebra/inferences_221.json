        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the remainder when the product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is divided by $42$?",
        "inference": "The five smallest prime numbers are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11$ and their product is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = 2310$. \nDividing $2310$ by $42$ gives a quotient of $55$ and a remainder of $0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The product of the $5$ smallest prime numbers is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, while $42=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 7$. Since the prime factorization of $42$ is included in the product $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11$, the former divides the latter perfectly, leaving remainder $\\boxed{0}$."
