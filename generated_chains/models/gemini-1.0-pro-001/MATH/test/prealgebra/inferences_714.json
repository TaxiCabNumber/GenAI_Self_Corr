At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen converting $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$",
        "inference": "Since the denominator is 1 followed by five 1s, the prime factorization of the denominator is $11^5$. Thus, the period length of the repeating decimal must divide 5, which in turn means that the period length must be either 1 or 5. But since $11^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, we have $31\\cdot 11^1 \\equiv 31 \\pmod{10}$, so the period length cannot be 1. Thus, the period length must be $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by noting that    $$\\frac{31}{11111} = \\frac{31 \\times 9}{11111 \\times 9} = \\frac{279}{99999}.$$We will show that   $$\\frac{279}{99999} = 0.\\overline{00279},$$so our final answer is $\\boxed{5}.$\n\nProof that $279/99999 = 0.\\overline{00279}$:\n\nLet $s = 0.\\overline{00279}$. Then multiplying both sides $10^5$ gives   $$10^5 s = 279.\\overline{00279}.$$Subtracting the left side by $s$ and the right side by $0.\\overline{00279}$ gives   $$99999s = 279,$$so $s = 279/99999$. It follows that $0.\\overline{00279} = 279 / 99999,$ as desired."
