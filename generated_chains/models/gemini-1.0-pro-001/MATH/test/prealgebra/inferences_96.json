At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCircle $A$ has a diameter of 12 inches and circle $B$ has a diameter of 22 inches. What is the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
