We see two different endings: $0.05001$ and $0.04999.$ Because the $0.05001$ is greater than $0.05,$ we will round the tenths place up in numbers that end in this. In addition, because $0.04999$ is less than $0.05,$ numbers with this ending will be rounded down. Thus, after rounding according to these rules, we get\n\n$\\bullet$ A. $14.5$\n\n$\\bullet$ B. $14.5$\n\n$\\bullet$ C. $14.4$\n\n$\\bullet$ D. $14.6$\n\nThus, $\\boxed{\\text{C}}$ is the smallest."
