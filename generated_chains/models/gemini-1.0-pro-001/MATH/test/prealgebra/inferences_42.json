        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 2 inch by 2 inch square has its area increased by 21 square inches producing a new square. How many inches long is a side of the new square?",
        "inference": "**Given:**\nOriginal square side length: 2 inches\nArea increase: 21 square inches\n\n**Formula for area of a square:**\nArea = side length^2\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Let x be the side length of the new square.\n\n2. Area of the original square: 2^2 = 4 square inches\n\n3. Area of the new square: x^2 square inches\n\n4. Area increase: x^2 - 4 = 21 square inches\n\n5. Solve for x:\n   x^2 - 4 = 21\n   x^2 = 25\n   x = 5 inches\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The area of the old square is $2\\cdot2=4$ square inches. The new area is $4+21=25$ square inches. So each side of the new square measures $\\sqrt{25}=\\boxed{5}$ inches."
