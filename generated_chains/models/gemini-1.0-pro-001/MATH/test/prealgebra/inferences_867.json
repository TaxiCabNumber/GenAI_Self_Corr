At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBobby stands 10 feet from Sam, and Eric stands 8 feet from Bobby. What is the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam?",
        "inference": "Bobby is 10 feet from Sam, and Eric is 8 feet from Bobby. To find the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam, we need to add the distance between Bobby and Eric with the distance between Bobby and Sam. \n$$10+8=18$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$18$} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Eric is on the circle of radius $8$ centered at Bobby.  The closest point on this circle to Sam is where it intersects the line segment between Bobby and Sam. If Eric is on this line segment, the minimum of $10-8=\\boxed{2}$ feet is obtained."
