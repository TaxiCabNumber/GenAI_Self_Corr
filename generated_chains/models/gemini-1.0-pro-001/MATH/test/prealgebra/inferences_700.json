At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many feet long is the shadow of a 15-foot flagpole if a 5-foot woman standing at the base of the flagpole has a shadow that is six feet long?",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nIf the woman's height is 5 feet and her shadow is 6 feet long, then the ratio of the woman's height to the length of her shadow is 5/6.\n\nSince the flagpole's height is 15 feet, we can use the ratio to find the length of its shadow:\n15 / (5/6) = 15 * 6/5 = 18 feet\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have $5 \\text{ foot object} : 6 \\text{ foot shadow}$. We want to find the length of the shadow of a 15-foot object. Multiplying both parts of the ratio by $\\frac{15}{5}=3$, we have $3 \\cdot 5 \\text{ foot object} : 3 \\cdot 6 \\text{ foot shadow} \\Rightarrow 15 \\text{ foot object} : 18 \\text{ foot shadow}$. Thus, the shadow is $\\boxed{18}$ feet long."
