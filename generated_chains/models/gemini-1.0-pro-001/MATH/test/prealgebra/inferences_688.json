At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has 25 members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer.  In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members can only hold at most one office?",
        "inference": "The president can be chosen in 25 ways.  Once the president is chosen, there are 24 members left, and the secretary can be chosen in 24 ways.  Finally, there are 23 members left, and the treasurer can be chosen in 23 ways.  Therefore, the number of ways to choose the officers is $25\\cdot24\\cdot23 = 13,800$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13,800}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The president can be any of the 25 members, the secretary can be any of the 24 remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining 23 members. There are $25\\times 24\\times 23=\\boxed{13,\\!800}$ ways."
