At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many terms of the sequence $\\sqrt{1},\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{4},\\ldots$ are less than or equal to $20$?",
        "inference": "We want to find the largest $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n}\\le 20$. Squaring both sides, we get $n\\le 400$. So, the largest $n$ such that $\\sqrt{n}\\le 20$ is $n=400$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{400}$ terms of the sequence that are less than or equal to $20$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{400}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "$20^2 = 400$, so each of the square roots up through $\\sqrt{400}$ is less than or equal to $20$. Thus, because the sequence starts at $1$, there are $\\boxed{400}$ such terms."
