        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo complementary angles, A and B, have measures in the ratio of 7 to 23, respectively. What is the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let x be the measure of angle A and y be the measure of angle B. Since the angles are complementary, we have x + y = 90 degrees. Also, x/y = 7/23. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 7/23 * y + y = 90 degrees, which gives y = 23/30 * 90 degrees = 69 degrees. Therefore, x = 90 degrees - 69 degrees = 21 degrees. The complement of angle A has a measure of 90 degrees - 21 degrees = 69 degrees, and the complement of angle B has a measure of 90 degrees - 69 degrees = 21 degrees. Therefore, the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle A to the measure of the complement of angle B is 69 degrees / 21 degrees = 3/1.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{3/1}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The complement of angle $A$ is just $B$, and the complement of $B$ is $A$.  So we seek the ratio of $B$ to $A$, which is reciprocal of $A$ to $B$, or just $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{7}}$."
