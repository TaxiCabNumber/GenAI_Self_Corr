At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTamantha wants to buy boxes in which to put her 77 compact discs. If each box holds 12 discs, how many does she need to buy?",
        "inference": "1. She needs 77 / 12 = 6.416... boxes. \n2. Since she cannot buy a fraction of a box, she needs to buy 7 boxes. \n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{7}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose Tamantha buys $n$ boxes. Since $n$ boxes will hold $12n$ discs, Tamantha will only be able to store all her discs if $12n \\ge 77$.\n\nDividing both sides of this inequality by $12$ gives $n\\ge \\frac{77}{12}$, which we can write as $n\\ge 6\\frac{5}{12}$. Tamantha can only buy a whole number of boxes, so the smallest number that will work is $\\boxed{7}$."
