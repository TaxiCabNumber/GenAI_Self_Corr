At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf each 1/2 inch on a map represents 20 miles, how many inches apart on the map are two cities whose actual distance apart is 120 miles?",
        "inference": "If 1/2 inch represents 20 miles then it takes 1 inch to represent 40 miles.\n\nThe 2 cities that are 120 miles apart would therefore be 3 inches apart on the map.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $20\\times 6=120$, we multiply 1/2 inches times 6 to get $\\boxed{3}$ inches for the distance between the cities on the map."
