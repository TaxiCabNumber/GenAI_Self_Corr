At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe five highest kick return averages, in yards, in the NFL's history were 25.0, 24.3, 24.1, 23.8 and 23.4. What is the median of these five averages? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we arrange these five return averages in ascending order, the median will be the middle number: $$23.4,23.8,\\textbf{24.1},24.3,25.0$$ The median of these five averages is $\\boxed{24.1}$."
