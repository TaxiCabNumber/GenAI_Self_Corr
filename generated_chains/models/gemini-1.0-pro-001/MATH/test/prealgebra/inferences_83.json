        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the prime factorization of $109!$, what is the exponent of $3$?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe prime factorization of $109!$ is the product of each prime that divides any number between 1 and 109 inclusive.\n\nThe exponent of $3$ in the prime factorization is the sum of the number of multiples of $3$, the number of multiples of $9$, and the number of multiples of $27$ in the range 1 to 109.\n\nThere are $\\frac{109}{3}=36$ multiples of $3$, $\\frac{109}{9}=12$ multiples of $9$, and $\\frac{109}{27}=4$ multiples of $27$ in the range 1 to 109, so the number of times a multiple of 3 appears in the range 1 to 109 is $36+12+4=52$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, we check how many of the numbers from $1$ to $109$ are multiples of $3$. We divide $109$ by $3$, and it comes out to be $36$ and a bit. So we know this gives us $36$ times the factor $3$ appears, to begin with.\n\nNow, some numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so they have $3$ as a factor twice, and we've only counted them once so far! There are $12$ multiples of $9$ less than $109$, and we need to add one to our exponent for each of these. That gives another $12$ to the exponent.\n\nSome numbers are also multiples of $3^3=27$. (Horrible, isn't it?) We actually have four such numbers: $27$, $54$, $81$, and $108$. We've counted two $3$s for each of them, so now we need to count one more for each, adding another $4$ to the exponent.\n\nOne more time. What about $3^4=81$? Yes, we do have a multiple of $81$ among our numbers. So we add one more to the exponent, and at last we've gotten all of them.\n\nFinally, we end up with a total of $36+12+4+1=\\boxed{53}$ in the exponent."
