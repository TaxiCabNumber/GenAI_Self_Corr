        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe length of one leg of a right triangle is 9 meters. The lengths of the other two sides are consecutive integer numbers of meters. What is the number of meters in the perimeter of the triangle?",
        "inference": "Let's denote the length of the other two sides of the right triangle as x and x + 1.\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n```\n9^2 = x^2 + (x + 1)^2\n81 = 2x^2 + 2x + 1\n2x^2 + 2x - 80 = 0\nx^2 + x - 40 = 0\n(x + 8)(x - 5) = 0\nx = -8 or x = 5\n```\nSince the lengths of the sides must be positive, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the lengths of the other two sides are 5 and 6 meters.\nThe perimeter of the triangle is:\n```\n9 + 5 + 6 = 20 meters\n```\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n9^2+x^2&=(x+1)^2 \\implies \\\\\n81+x^2&=x^2+2x+1 \\implies \\\\\n2x&=80 \\implies \\\\\nx&=40,\n\\end{align*}where $x$ is the shorter missing side.  It follows that the sides of the triangle are 9, 40, and 41 meters, and the perimeter of the triangle is $9+40+41=\\boxed{90}$ meters.\n\nNote: for any odd integer $n$, the two integers closest to $n^2/2$ along with $n$ form a Pythagorean triple."
