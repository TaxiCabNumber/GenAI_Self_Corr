At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many zeroes are at the end of $42!$ (42 factorial)?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)",
        "inference": "**Solution step by step:**\n\n* The number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number is equal to the number of times the number can be divided by 10.\n* 42 can be divided by 10 four times: 42 \u00f7 10 = 4; 4 \u00f7 10 = 0.4; 0.4 \u00f7 10 = 0.04; 0.04 \u00f7 10 = 0.004.\n* Four of the numbers from 1 to 42 are multiples of 10, so 42! has four trailing zeros.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nEvery time a number is a multiple of $5$, it adds a factor of $5$ to the prime factorization. There are $8$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $42$. Now look at $25$. It actually has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them, so now we need to count one more. This gives a total of $8+1=9$ times the factor $5$ appears, so $42!$ has $\\boxed{9}$ zeroes at the end."
