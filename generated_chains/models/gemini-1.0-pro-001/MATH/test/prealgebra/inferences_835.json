At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4 and 5?",
        "inference": "Divisibility by 3 means that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. Consider only the last digit. If the last digit is 0, 3, 6 or 9, the number is divisible by 3. In the first 500 positive integers, there are 167 numbers with last digit 0, 3, 6 or 9.\n\nDivisibility by 4 means the last two digits are divisible by 4. The possible last two digits are 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, and 96. In the first 500 positive integers, there are 125 numbers with last two digits divisible by 4.\n\nDivisibility by 5 means the last digit is 0 or 5. In the first 500 positive integers, there are 100 numbers with last digit 0 or 5.\n\nThe problem asks for the number divisible by 3, 4 and 5. The previous three paragraphs found the number divisible by 3, 4, and 5 respectively. These three numbers are not all distinct, so it is necessary to do some intersection counting.\n\nThe number divisible by 3 and 4 is the smaller of 167 and 125, which is 125. The number divisible by 3 and 5 is the smaller of 167 and 100, which is 100. The number divisible by 4 and 5 is the smaller of 125 and 100, which is 100. The number divisible by 3, 4, and 5 is the smaller of 125, 100, and 100, which is 100.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The least common multiple of 3, 4, and 5 is $3\\cdot4\\cdot5=60$, so we must find how many multiples of 60 are less than 500.  These multiples of 60 are $1\\cdot 60, 2\\cdot 60, \\ldots 8\\cdot 60$.  Thus, $\\boxed{8}$ of the first 500 positive integers are divisible by 3, 4, and 5."
