At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that we roll two fair 6-sided dice.  What is the probability that the two numbers rolled sum to 4?",
        "inference": "There are 36 possible outcomes when you roll two 6-sided dice. The outcomes that sum to 4 are: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1). \nThus the probability of rolling a sum of 4 is 3 / 36 = 1 / 12.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/12}. I hope it is correct.",
