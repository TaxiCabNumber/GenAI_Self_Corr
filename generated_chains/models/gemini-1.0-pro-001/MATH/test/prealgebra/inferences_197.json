At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBefore taking his last test in a class, the arithmetic mean of Brian's  test scores is 91. He has determined that if he scores 98 on his last test, the arithmetic mean of all his test scores will be exactly 92. How many tests, including the last test, does Brian take for this class?",
        "inference": "Brian's arithmetic mean of all his scores, including the last test, is 92 so, the total of all his scores, including the last test, is 92 times the number of tests, including the last test. This total is the sum of his previous scores and his last score. So we have an equation:\n\n$$92\\times(\\text{number of tests})=91\\times(\\text{number of tests}-1)+98$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$92\\times(\\text{number of tests})= 91\\times(\\text{number of tests})-91+98$$\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n$$92\\times(\\text{number of tests})-91\\times(\\text{number of tests})=98-91$$\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$$(\\text{number of tests})(92-91)=7$$\n\nDividing both sides by 92-91:\n\n$$(\\text{number of tests})=\\frac{7}{92-91}=\\frac{7}{1}=7$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{ 7 }.

        "ground_truth": "Let $S$ be the sum of all of Brian's test scores up to this point, and let $n$ be the number of tests Brian has taken up to this point. Thus the arithmetic mean of his scores now is $\\frac{S}{n}$ and the arithmetic mean of his scores after getting a 98 on the last test will be $\\frac{S+98}{n+1}$. This gives the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{S}{n} &= 91 & \\frac{S+98}{n+1} & = 92\n\\end{align*} From the first equation we have $S = 91n$. Substituting this into the second equation gives: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{S+98}{n+1} &= 92\\\\\nS+98 &= 92(n+1)\\\\\n91n+98 &= 92n+92\\\\\n92n-91n&= 98-92\\\\\nn&= 6\n\\end{align*} So Brian has to take $n+1 = \\boxed{7}$ tests."
