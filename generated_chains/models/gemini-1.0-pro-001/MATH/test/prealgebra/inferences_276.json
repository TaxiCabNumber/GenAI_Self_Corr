At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy classroom has 11 rows of chairs, with 11 chairs in each row.  The chairs in each row are numbered from 1 to 11.  How many chairs have odd numbers?",
        "inference": "There are 11 rows of chairs. Each row has 11 chairs, and each chair is numbered from 1 to 11. So, the total number of chairs is 11 * 11 = 121.\n\nTo find the number of chairs with odd numbers, we can first find the number of chairs with even numbers. There are 5 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), so there are 5 * 11 = 55 chairs with even numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of chairs with odd numbers is 121 - 55 = 66.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$66$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each row has odd-numbered chairs $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11$ for a total of 6 odd-numbered chairs in each row.  Since there are 11 rows, there are a total number of $11 \\times 6 = \\boxed{66}$ chairs with odd numbers."
