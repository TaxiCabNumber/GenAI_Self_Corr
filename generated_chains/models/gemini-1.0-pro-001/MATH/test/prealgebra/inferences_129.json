At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBenjamin is trying to break a combination lock. This particular type of lock has 5 digits from 0 to 9, and Benjamin just happens to know that there can be no repeated digits in the code for this type of lock. How many valid codes are there?",
        "inference": "1. There are 10 digits (0-9) that can be used for each of the 5 digits in the code.\n2. For the first digit, there are 10 choices.\n3. For the second digit, there are 9 choices (since the digit used for the first digit cannot be used again).\n4. For the third digit, there are 8 choices.\n5. For the fourth digit, there are 7 choices.\n6. For the fifth digit, there are 6 choices.\n7. Therefore, the total number of valid codes is: 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 = 30,240.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30,240}$. I hope it is correct.",
