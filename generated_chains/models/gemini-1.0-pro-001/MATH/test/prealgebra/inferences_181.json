At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA particular convex pentagon has two congruent, acute angles. The measure of each of the other interior angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two acute angles. What is the common measure of the large angles, in degrees?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nLet $x$ be the measure of each of the acute angles. Then, the other interior angles are $2x$. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $540^\\circ$, so we have\n\n$$x+2x+2x+2x+2x=540^\\circ\\Rightarrow 9x=540^\\circ\\Rightarrow x=60^\\circ.$$Therefore, the common measure of the large angles is $2x=\\boxed{120^\\circ}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{120^\\circ}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the measure in degrees of each of the acute angles, then each of the larger angles measures $2x$ degrees.  Since the number of degrees in the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$, we have \\[\nx+x+2x+2x+2x=540 \\implies 8x = 540 \\implies x=135/2.\n\\] The large angles each measure $2x=\\boxed{135}$ degrees."
