At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many 3-letter sequences can be formed if the second letter must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, or U), and the third letter must be different from the first letter?",
