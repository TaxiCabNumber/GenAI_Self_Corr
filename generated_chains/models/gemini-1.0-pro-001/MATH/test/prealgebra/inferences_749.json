        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe temperature in a desert rose $1.5$ degrees in $15$ minutes.  If this rate of increase remains constant, how many degrees will the temperature rise in the next $2$ hours?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the time from hours to minutes: $2$ hours $= 2 \\times 60 = 120$ minutes.\n2. Determine how many minutes the temperature rose in the given time: $15$ minutes.\n3. Calculate the rate of increase per minute: $1.5 \\degree / 15 \\text{ minutes} =0.1 \\degree / \\text{ minute}$.\n4. Multiply the rate of increase by the time in minutes to find the total increase in temperature: $0.1 \\degree/\\text{ minute} \\times 120 \\text{ minutes} =12 \\degree$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Firstly, we find that the temperature rises $\\frac{1.5}{15}=0.1$ degrees per minute.  Thus, since $2$ hours contains $120$ minutes, we find that the temperature will rise $0.1 \\times 120=\\boxed{12}$ degrees."
