At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSallie earned a grade of exactly $90 \\%$ for a marking period based on six equally weighed tests. The four test papers she can find have grades of exactly $83 \\%$, $96 \\%$, $81 \\%$, and $82\\%$. What is the sum of the percent scores of the two missing grades?",
        "inference": "The four grades she can find have a combined score of $83+96+81+82=342$ percent.  \nSince she earned a $90$ percent average, her total score should have been $342+90\\cdot 2=522$ percent.  \nThe remaining two grades must, therefore, have a combined score of $522-342=\\boxed{180}$ percent. \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose each test is worth $x$ points.  Then on the tests Sallie found, she has a total of $.83x + .96x + .81 x + .82x = 3.42 x$ points.  In all, she earned $6\\cdot .9x = 5.4 x$ points.  Thus, on the two remaining tests she scored $1.98x$ points, which is a total of $\\boxed{198\\%}$."
