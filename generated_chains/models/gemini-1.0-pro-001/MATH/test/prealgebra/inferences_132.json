At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBekah has exactly three brass house number digits: 2, 3 and 5. How many distinct numbers can she form using one or more of the digits?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of distinct numbers that can be formed using one digit:\n- 2, 3, 5\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of distinct numbers that can be formed using two digits:\n- 23, 25, 32, 35, 52, 53\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the number of distinct numbers that can be formed using three digits:\n- 235, 253, 325, 352, 523, 532\n\n**Step 4:** Add the numbers from each step to get the total number of distinct numbers:\n- 1 (one digit) + 6 (two digits) + 6 (three digits) = 13\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Bekah uses only one digit, she can form three numbers. If she uses two digits, she has three choices for the tens place and two for the units, so she can form six numbers. Finally, if Bekah uses all three digits, she has three choices for the hundreds place, two for the tens, and one for the units, so she can form six numbers. Thus, Bekah can form $3 + 6 + 6 = \\boxed{15}$ distinct numbers."
