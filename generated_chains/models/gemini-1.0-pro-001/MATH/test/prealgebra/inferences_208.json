        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBrass is an alloy created using $80\\%$ copper and $20\\%$ zinc. If Henri's brass trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, how many ounces of zinc are in the trumpet?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the percentages to decimals: $$80\\% = 0.8$$ and $$20\\% = 0.2$$.\n2. Let $x$ be the number of ounces of zinc in the trumpet. Then, the total number of ounces of brass in the trumpet is $$0.8x + 0.2x = x$$.\n3. We know that the trumpet contains 48 ounces of copper, so we can set up the equation: $$0.8x = 48$$.\n4. Solve for $x$: $$\\begin{align*} 0.8x &= 48\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad x &= \\frac{48}{0.8} = 60. \\end{align*}$$\n5. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{60}$ ounces of zinc in the trumpet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{60}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "This means that the trumpet is $\\frac{4}{5}$ copper, and $\\frac{1}{5}$ zinc.  Since there are 48 ounces of copper, and that represents $\\frac{4}{5}$ of the total, we can simply divide by 4 to find the corresponding amount of zinc, making for $\\frac{48}{4} = \\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc."
