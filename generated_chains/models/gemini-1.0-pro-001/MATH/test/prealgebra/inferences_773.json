At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a set of five positive integers whose average (mean) is 5, whose median is 5, and whose only mode is 8. What is the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the set?",
        "inference": "The sum of the five integers is 5 * 5 = 25. Since the mode is 8, there is at least one 8.\n\nThe remaining sum of the four other integers is 25 - 8 = 17. Since the median is 5, there must be two integers that are 5.\n\nThe remaining sum of the two other integers is 17 - 2 * 5 = 7. Since the average is 5, the sum of the two other integers must be 7.\n\nThe two other integers must be 3 and 4.\n\nThe set of five integers is {3, 4, 5, 5, 8}.\n\nThe difference between the largest and smallest integers in the set is 8 - 3 = 5.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 5 is the median, there must be two integers greater than 5 and two less than 5. The five integers may be arranged this way: $\\underline{\\ \\ \\ }, \\ \\underline{\\ \\ \\ },  \\  5, \\  8, \\ 8$. Since the mean is 5, the sum of all five integers is 25. The numbers 5, 8, and 8 total 21, leaving 4 for the sum of the first two. They can't both be 2 since 8 is the only mode, so they are 1 and 3. The difference between 8 and 1 is $\\boxed{7}$."
