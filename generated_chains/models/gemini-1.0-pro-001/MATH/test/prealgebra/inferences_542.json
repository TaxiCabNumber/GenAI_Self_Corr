        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCasey's shop class is making a golf trophy.  He has to paint $300$ dimples on a golf ball.  If it takes him $2$ seconds to paint one dimple, how many minutes will he need to do his job?",
        "inference": "1. Convert 2 seconds to minutes: 2 seconds = 2/60 = 1/30 minutes.\n2. Multiply the number of dimples by the time it takes to paint one dimple: 300 dimples x 1/30 minutes/dimple = 10 minutes.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At $2$ seconds per dimple, it takes $300 \\times 2 = 600$ seconds to paint them.  Since there are $60$ seconds in a minute, he will need $600 \\div 60 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes."
