        "inference": "An interior angle of a regular decagon can be calculated by the formula:\n$$A = 180\\degree\\frac{n-2}{n},$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of sides.\n\nAn interior angle of a regular pentagon can be calculated by the same formula:\n$$A = 180\\degree\\frac{5-2}{5} = 180\\degree\\frac{3}{5} = 108\\degree.$$\n\nTherefore, the measure of an interior angle of a regular decagon is $180\\degree\\frac{10-2}{10} = 180\\degree\\frac{8}{10} = 144\\degree$.\n\nThe measure of an interior angle of a regular decagon is $144\\degree - 108\\degree = 36\\degree$ greater than the measure of an interior angle of a regular pentagon.\n$$\\boxed{\\text{Final Answer: }36}.$$",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the decagon's angles is $180(10-2) = 1440$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\\frac{1440^\\circ}{10} = 144^\\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular pentagon has measure $\\frac{540^\\circ}{5} = 108^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the desired difference is $144^\\circ - 108^\\circ = \\boxed{36^\\circ}$."
