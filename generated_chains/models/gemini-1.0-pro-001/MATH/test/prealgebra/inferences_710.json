At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

This means that the 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point will be the same as the 1000th remainder.\n\nThe 1000th remainder is 0, so the 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point is **0**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{4}{15}=0.2\\overline{6}$. Therefore, every digit to the right of the decimal point besides the $2$ in the tenths place will be $6$. The 1000th digit to the right of the decimal point is $\\boxed{6}$."
