        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Newport Crab Company marks the location of its crab pots with colored balloons. They mark every fourth pot with a red balloon, every sixth pot with a blue balloon, and every tenth pot with a yellow balloon. After placing 600 crab pots in the bay, how many pots have three different colored balloons attached?",
        "inference": "<b>Step 1:</b> Find the number of pots marked with each color of balloon.\nSince every fourth pot is marked with a red balloon, there are $\\frac{600}{4}=150$ red balloons. Similarly, there are $\\frac{600}{6}=100$ blue balloons and $\\frac{600}{10}=60$ yellow balloons.\n\n<b>Step 2:</b> Find the number of pots with two different colored balloons.\nThe pots with two different colored balloons are the pots that are marked with both a red and a blue balloon, both a red and a yellow balloon, and both a blue and a yellow balloon. There are $\\frac{150}{2}=75$ pots with both a red and a blue balloon, $\\frac{150}{2}=75$ pots with both a red and a yellow balloon, and $\\frac{100}{2}=50$ pots with both a blue and a yellow balloon.\n\n<b>Step 3:</b> Find the number of pots with three different colored balloons.\nThe only pots with three different colored balloons are the pots that are marked with a red, a blue, and a yellow balloon. There are $\\frac{150}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{3}\\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{25}$ such pots.\n\n<b>Final Answer: $\\boxed{25}$. I hope it is correct.</b>",
        "ground_truth": "A pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it if it is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10. Thus, we must first find the LCM of 4, 6, and 10. $4=2^2$, $6=2\\cdot3$, and $10=2\\cdot5$. For a number to be a multiple of all three of these numbers, it prime factorization must have a 2 raised to at least the second power, a 3 raised to at least the first power, and a 5 raised to at least the first power. Thus, the least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, every 60th pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it. Because there are 600 total pots, the number of pots with 3 different colored balloons on it is $600 \\div 60=\\boxed{10}$."
