        "inference": "An angle is a figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. In this problem, an angle is formed by two straight lines, AB and BD, intersecting at point B, which is the vertex of the angle. The measure of an angle is a measurement of its size, and is usually expressed in degrees. The number of degrees in the measure of an angle is equal to the number of times the angle can be divided into a right angle. A right angle is an angle that measures 90 degrees.  \n\nIn this problem, angle ABD is a straight angle, which means that the two sides of the angle, AB and BD, form a straight line. A straight line is a line that extends in both directions without bending or curving. The measure of a straight angle is 180 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle ABD is 180 degrees.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$. I hope it is correct",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\angle ABC$ is a straight angle, we have $6x + 3x = 180^\\circ$, so $9x = 180^\\circ$ and $x = 20^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle ABD = 6x = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$."
