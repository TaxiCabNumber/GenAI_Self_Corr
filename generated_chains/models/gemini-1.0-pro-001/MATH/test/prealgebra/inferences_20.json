        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn ordinary $6$-sided die has a number on each face from $1$ to $6$ (each number appears on one face). How many ways can I paint two faces of a die blue, so that the product of the numbers on the painted faces isn't equal to $6$?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Determine the number of ways to paint two faces of the die blue, without regard to the product of the numbers.\nThere are $6$ choices for the first face to be painted blue. Once that face is chosen, there are $5$ choices for the second face to be painted blue. So, the number of ways to paint two faces of the die blue without regard to the product of the numbers is $6 \\times 5 = 30$.\n\n**Step 2**: Determine the number of ways to paint two faces of the die blue so that the product of the numbers is equal to $6$.\nThere are two ways to paint two faces of the die blue so that the product of the numbers is equal to $6$:\n- Paint the faces with the numbers $2$ and $3$.\n- Paint the faces with the numbers $3$ and $2$.\n\n**Step 3**: Subtract the number of ways in Step $2$ from the number of ways in Step $1$ to get the number of ways to paint two faces of the die blue so that the product of the numbers is not equal to $6$.\n\nNumber of ways to paint two faces blue without restriction = $30$\nNumber of ways to paint two faces blue with product $6$ = $2$\nNumber of ways to paint two faces blue with product not $6$ = $30 - 2 = \\boxed{28}$.\n**Final Answer: $28$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, let's ignore the requirement that the product can't be $6$. Then I can pick the first blue face in $6$ ways, and the second blue face in $5$ ways, making $6\\cdot 5 = 30$ choices in all. But we've actually counted each possible result twice, because it makes no difference which of the two blue faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the number of different pairs of faces is really $(6\\cdot 5)/2$, or $15$.\n\nNow we exclude the pairs which have a product of $6$. There are two such pairs: $\\{1,6\\}$ and $\\{2,3\\}$. That leaves me $\\boxed{13}$ pairs of faces I can paint blue."
