At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA pencil costs $p$ dollars and an eraser costs $e$ dollars. Mark buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, and he buys $7$ pencils. Write an expression that represents the amount of money that Mark spent, in dollars.",
        "inference": "Mark spent $p$ dollars per pencil and $e$ dollars per eraser. He bought $7$ pencils and $7 - 3 = 4$ erasers. The total cost of the pencils is $7p$ dollars, and the total cost of the erasers is $4e$ dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money that Mark spent is $(7p) + (4e)$ dollars.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(7p) + (4e)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Mark buys $7$ pencils, and a pencil costs $p$ dollars, so the total cost of all of the pencils is $7\\cdot p$ dollars. He buys $3$ more pencils than erasers, so he buys $4$ erasers. Each eraser costs $e$ dollars, so the total cost of all the erasers is $4\\cdot e$ dollars. Thus, Mark spent $\\boxed{7p+4e}$ dollars in total."
