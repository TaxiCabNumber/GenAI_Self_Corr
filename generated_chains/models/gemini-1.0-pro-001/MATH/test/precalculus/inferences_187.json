At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of complex numbers $z_0,z_1,z_2,\\ldots$ is defined by the rule \\[\nz_{n+1}=\\frac{\\ iz_n\\ }{\\overline{z}_n},\n\\]where $\\overline{z}_n$ is the complex conjugate of $z_n$ and $i^2=-1$. Suppose that $|z_0|=1$ and $z_{2005}=1$. How many possible values are there for $z_0$?",

Similarly, we can show that $z_{2003}=-1$, $z_{2002}=-i$, $z_{2001}=1$, and so on. Therefore, $z_{2005-2n}=(-1)^ni$ for all integers $n$. Since $|z_0|=1$, we have that $|z_1|=|i|=1$, $|z_2|=|-1|=1$, and so on. Therefore, $|z_{2005-2n}|=1$ for all integers $n$. Since $z_0$ is a complex number with modulus $1$, there are two possible values for $z_0$: $z_0=1$ or $z_0=-1$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",

So there are $\\boxed{2^{2005}}$ possible values for $z_0$."
