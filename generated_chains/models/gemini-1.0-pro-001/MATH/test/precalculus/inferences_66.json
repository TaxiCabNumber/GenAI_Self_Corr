        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince $90^\\circ$ is a right angle, the sine of $90^\\circ$ is the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. In a right triangle, the opposite side is the length of the side opposite the angle, and the hypotenuse is the length of the side opposite the right angle. In this case, the opposite side is 1 and the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\\sin 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\).
