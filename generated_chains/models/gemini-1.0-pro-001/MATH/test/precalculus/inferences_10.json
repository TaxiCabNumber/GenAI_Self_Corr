So, the equation of line $AB$ is $y-5=-x$, or $y=5-x$.\n\nSimilarly, line $AC$ has a slope of $\\frac{1-3}{4-2} = -1$ and a y-intercept of $1$. So, the equation of line $AC$ is $y-1=-x$, or $y=1-x$.\n\nFinally, line $BC$ has a slope of $\\frac{4-5}{4-0} = -\\frac{1}{4}$ and a y-intercept of $4$. So, the equation of line $BC$ is $y-4=-\\frac{1}{4}x$, or $y=4-\\frac{1}{4}x$.\n\nSince the center of the cube is equidistant from each of the three vertices, it must lie on the intersection of the three lines $y=5-x$, $y=1-x$, and $y=4-\\frac{1}{4}x$.\nSolving the system of equations \n$$y=5-x,$$$$y=1-x,$$$$y=4-\\frac{1}{4}x$$ \ngives $x=2$.
