At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen rolling two fair, standard six-faced dice, what is the probability of rolling the same number on both dice? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $6$ possible outcomes for each die, and $36$ possible outcomes for rolling both dice. The outcomes where the numbers on the two dice are the same are $(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)$, so there are $6$ possible outcomes where the numbers on the two dice are the same. Therefore, the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is $\\frac{6}{36}=\\frac{1}{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "No matter what the result of the first roll is, there are 6 equally likely possibilities for the second roll, only one of which is the same as the first roll.  Therefore, the probability that the dice show the same number is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
