At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "We can treat each party as a single unit, so there are 3 units: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent.  Therefore, the number of ways they can sit around a circular table is \n$$P(3,3)=3!=6.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Choose any seat in which to place the Independent -- it doesn't matter which seat that we choose, since we can rotate the table. Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats. So, the total number of ways to seat the people around the table is $2\\cdot5!\\cdot5!=2\\cdot120\\cdot120=\\boxed{28800}$."
