At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits from 1 to 6 are arranged to form a six-digit multiple of 5. What is the probability that the number is greater than 500,000? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The number is a multiple of 5, so the last digit must be 0 or 5. There are 2 choices for the last digit.\n\nThe first digit cannot be 0, so there are 5 choices for the first digit.\n\nFor the remaining four digits, there are 5 choices for each digit.\n\nSo, there are $2\\cdot5\\cdot5^4=1250$ six-digit numbers that are multiples of 5.\n\nThe numbers greater than 500,000 are 510,000, 510,005, ..., 599,995, 599,990. There are 90 such numbers.\n\nSo, the probability that the number is greater than 500,000 is $\\frac{90}{1250}=\\frac{9}{125}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{125}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Of the digits 1 to 6, 5 must be the units digit since our number is a multiple of 5. We have five digits remaining, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, for five digit places. The number is greater than 500,000 if and only if the hundred thousands digit is 6. The probability that the hundred thousands digit (which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) is 6 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$."
