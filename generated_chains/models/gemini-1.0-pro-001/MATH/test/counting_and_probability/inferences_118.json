At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the probability that if you roll two fair, standard six-sided dice, the difference between the two numbers rolled will be 0? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The difference between the two numbers rolled will be 0 if and only if the same number is rolled on both dice. There are 6 possible outcomes for each die, so there are $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in total. There are 6 pairs of numbers that are the same, so there are 6 ways to roll the same number on both dice. Therefore, the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is $\\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$. I hope it is correct.",
