At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many non-congruent  triangles can be drawn such that their vertices lie on the corners of a unit cube?",

        "ground_truth": "The distances between corners of a unit cube are 1, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and 1, the third side has to be $\\sqrt{2}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must be $\\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{2}$, the third side must also be $\\sqrt{2}$. There is no case where the shortest side is $\\sqrt{3}$. This gives $\\boxed{3}$ non-congruent triangles."
