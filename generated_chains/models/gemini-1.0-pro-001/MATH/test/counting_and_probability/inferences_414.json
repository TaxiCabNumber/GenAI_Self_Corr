At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLiz has 11 marbles of different colors. In how many ways can she choose 3 of the marbles, if she refuses to choose the green one and the purple one at the same time?",
        "inference": "1. Liz has 11 marbles to choose from, but she cannot choose the green and purple marbles at the same time. So, she has 11 - 2 = 9 marbles to choose from.\n\n2. She can choose 3 marbles from the 9 marbles in ${9 \\choose 3} = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \\frac{9!}{3!6!} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 84$ ways.\n\n3. However, she can choose either the green or the purple marble in ${2 \\choose 1} = 2$ ways. So, she can choose 3 marbles from the 9 marbles, including either the green or the purple marble, in $84 \\cdot 2 = 168$ ways.\n\n**Final Answer: ${ \\boxed{168} }$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can divide this into cases:\n\nCase 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.\n\nCase 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.\n\nThe total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\\boxed{156}$.\n\nAlternatively, there are $\\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen."
