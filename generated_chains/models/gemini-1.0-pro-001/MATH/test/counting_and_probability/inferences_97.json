        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $*(n) = \\left\\{ n-2, n+2, 2n, \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\}$. For example, $*(6) = \\{4, 8, 12, 3\\}$. For how many distinct integers $n$ does $*(n)$ have exactly three distinct elements?",
        "inference": "We have that $*(n) = \\{n-2, n+2, 2n, n/2\\}$. Since $n-2$ and $n+2$ have a difference of $4$, they must be different. Since $n$ and $2n$ have a difference of $n$, they must be different if $n>1$. Since $n/2$ and $n$ have a difference of $n/2$, they must be different if $n>2$. Therefore, $*(n)$ has exactly three distinct elements if and only if $n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \\frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{5}$ such $n$."
