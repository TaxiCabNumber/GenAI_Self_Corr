        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA turn consists of rolling a standard die and tossing a fair coin. The game is won when the die shows a 1 or a 6 and the coin shows heads. What is the probability the game will be won before the fourth turn? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of winning on the first turn is $\\frac{1}{12}$.\n\nThe probability of not winning on the first turn is $\\frac{11}{12}$.\n\nThe probability of winning on the second turn, given that we did not win on the first turn, is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{11}{12} = \\frac{11}{144}$.\n\nThe probability of not winning on the first two turns is $\\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{121}{144}$.\n\nThe probability of winning on the third turn, given that we did not win on the first two turns, is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^2 = \\frac{121}{1728}$.\n\nThe probability of not winning on the first three turns is $\\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1331}{1728}$.\n\nThe probability of winning on the fourth turn, given that we did not win on the first three turns, is $\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1331}{20736}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning before the fourth turn is $1 - \\left(\\frac{11}{12}\\right)^3 = \\frac{5832}{20736} = \\frac{486}{1728}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{486}{1728}}$.

        "ground_truth": "The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3=\\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\\dfrac{125}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{91}{216}}$."
