At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\" can I form?",
        "inference": "1. First, we count the number of letters in the word ``Hawaii\". There are 6 letters.\n2. Next, we use the formula for permutations to calculate the number of distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\". The formula for permutations is:\n\n```\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n```\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be selected.\n\nIn this case, n = 6 and r = 6, so:\n\n```\nP(6, 6) = 6! / (6 - 6)! = 6! / 0! = 6! / 1 = 720\n```\n\n3. Therefore, there are 720 distinct six-letter rearrangements of the word ``Hawaii\".\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$720$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If every letter of ``Hawaii\" were different, there would be $6! = 6\\cdot 5 \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii\" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\\frac{6!}{2\\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 30 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{180}$."
