At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe roll a fair 6-sided die 5 times.  What is the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls?",

        "ground_truth": "The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \\[\\frac{\\binom{5}{2}5^3+\\binom{5}{1}5^4+\\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\\boxed{\\frac{625}{648}}.\\]"
