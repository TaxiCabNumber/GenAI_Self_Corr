At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the famous baseball player for the San Francisco Midgets, Larry Ponds, has a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance of earning a walk on each plate appearance, what is the probability that he will earn a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

The probability of him not earning a walk on his first plate appearance is $1-\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$. The probability of him earning a walk on his second plate appearance is $\\frac{2}{5}$. The probability of him not earning a walk on his second plate appearance is $1-\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe probability of Larry earning a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances is the sum of the probabilities of the following scenarios:\n\n* He earns a walk on his first plate appearance and does not earn a walk on his second plate appearance.\n* He does not earn a walk on his first plate appearance and earns a walk on his second plate appearance.\n\nThe probability of the first scenario is $\\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{6}{25}$. The probability of the second scenario is $\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{6}{25}$.\n\nThe probability of Larry earning a walk exactly once in his next two plate appearances is $\\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{12}{25}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{12}{25}$.

        "ground_truth": "If he earns a walk on exactly one of his next two plate appearances, then one of his at-bats must be a walk and the other must not.
