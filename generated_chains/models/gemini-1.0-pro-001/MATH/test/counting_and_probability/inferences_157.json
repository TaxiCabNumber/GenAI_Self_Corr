Put 2 balls in Box A and 2 balls in Box B.\n4. Put 1 ball in Box A and 3 balls in Box B.\n5. Put no balls in Box A and 4 balls in Box B.\n\nHence, there are 5 ways to put the 4 balls into the 2 boxes.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, the only thing we need to keep track of is how many balls are in each box.  In this case, we can just list the cases: we put either 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 balls into the first box, and the rest into the second box.  Thus there are $\\boxed{5}$ ways to arrange 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes."
