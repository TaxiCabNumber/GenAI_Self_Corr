        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. Two of the dice come up the same, but the other three are all different from those two and different from each other. The pair is set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled. The dice are said to show a \"full house\" if three of the dice show the same value and the other two show the same value (and potentially, but not necessarily, all five dice show the same value). What is the probability that after the second set of rolls, the dice show a full house?",
        "inference": "The probability that the two dice that are initially set aside show the same number is $\\frac{6}{36}=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that the other three dice show three different numbers is $\\frac{20}{36}=\\frac{5}{9}$. The probability that the three dice that are re-rolled show the same number is $\\frac{6}{36}=\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that the two dice that are initially set aside show the same number as the three dice that are re-rolled is $\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that the dice show a full house is therefore $\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{9}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{5}{972}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{972}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.\n\nSo there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{21}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{72}}.$$"
