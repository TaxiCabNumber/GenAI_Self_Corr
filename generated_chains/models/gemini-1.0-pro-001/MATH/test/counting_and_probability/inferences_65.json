        "inference": "There are 15 vertices in a pentagonal prism. A diagonal is formed by connecting two nonadjacent vertices. There are 10 ways to choose the first vertex of a diagonal and 5 ways to choose the second vertex of the diagonal. So there are 10 * 5 = 50 possible diagonals. However, each diagonal is counted twice, since it can be formed by connecting the two vertices in either order. Therefore, the number of diagonals in a pentagonal prism is 50 / 2 = **25**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$25$}. I hope it is correct.",
