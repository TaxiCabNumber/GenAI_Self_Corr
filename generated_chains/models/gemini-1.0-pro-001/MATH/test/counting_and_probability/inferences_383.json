I hope it is correct.'\n3 cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they form a pair?  (A 3-card hand is a 'pair' if two of the cards match in rank but the third card is different.  For example, 668 is a pair, but 999 is not.)",
        "inference": "First, consider the number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52 cards:  C(52, 3) = 22,100\nNext, count the number of ways 3 cards form a pair.  There are 13 ranks, and for each rank, there are 4 cards of that rank.  So, there are C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose 2 cards of the same rank.  Then, there are 12 ranks remaining, and for each rank, there are 3 cards of that rank.  So, there are C(12, 1) = 12 ways to choose the third card.  Thus, there are 13 * 6 * 12 = 936 ways that 3 cards can form a pair.\n\nTo find the probability of choosing a pair, divide the number of ways to choose a pair by the total number of ways to choose 3 cards:\n\nP(pair) = 936 / 22,100\nP(pair) = 0.0423\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.0423$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{52}{3} = 22,\\!100$ ways to choose 3 cards out of 52, without regard to order.  To choose two cards of matching rank, there are 13 different ranks and $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ combinations of suits to choose from, for a total of $13 \\times 6 = 78$ different possibilities.  There are 48 remaining cards not in the same rank as the first two.  This means there are $78 \\times 48 = 3,\\!744$ ways to choose a hand that is a pair.  So the probability that a randomly drawn hand is a pair is $\\dfrac{3744}{22100} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{72}{425}}$."
