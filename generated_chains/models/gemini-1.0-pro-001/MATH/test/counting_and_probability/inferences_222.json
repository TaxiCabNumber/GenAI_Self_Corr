At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the coefficient of $xy$ in the expansion of $(3x+(2y+1))^2$?",
        "inference": "First, expand the square:\n$$(3x+(2y+1))^2 = (3x)^2 + 2(3x)(2y+1) + (2y+1)^2 \\\\ = 9x^2 + 12xy + 4y^2 + 4y + 1.$$\nThe coefficient of $xy$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
