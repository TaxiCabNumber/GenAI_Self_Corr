        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(n)$ return the number of times $n$ appears in Pascal's Triangle. For example, $f(3) = 2$ and $f(4) = 2$. If $n$ is a positive integer, what is the minimum value of $f(n)$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe value of $f(n)$ is equal to the number of binomial coefficients $\\binom{m}{n}$ such that $0 \\leq m \\leq n$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of integer solutions to the equation $m-n \\leq 0$.\n\nThis is the same as finding the number of integer solutions to the equation $m \\leq n$.\n\nThe number of integer solutions to this equation is $n+1$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Every positive integer appears at least once; if we consider an arbitrary integer $k$, it can be written in the form $\\binom{k}{1}$. Almost all integers can be written twice, because $\\binom{k}{1} = \\binom{k}{k-1} = k$, but when $k-1 = 1$, the two occurrences overlap into one. This takes place for $k = 2$, and $2$ only appears once in Pascal's Triangle, because succeeding rows of Pascal's Triangle only contain $1$'s and numbers greater than $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\\boxed{1}$."
