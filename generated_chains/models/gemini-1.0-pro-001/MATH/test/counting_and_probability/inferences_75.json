At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo candidates, Dan and Donald, run for class president. Two other candidates, Freddie and Bernie, run for vice president. Each candidate has a 50$\\%$ chance of winning. What is the probability that both Dan and Freddie win? (Express your answer as a fraction.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe probability that Dan wins is 1/2. The probability that Freddie wins is 1/2.\n\nThe probability that both Dan and Freddie win is the product of their individual probabilities:\n\nP(Dan wins) * P (Freddie wins) = (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/4**\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$1/4$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that Dan wins is $\\frac12$. The probability that Freddie wins is also $\\frac12$. Therefore, the probability that both win is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 =\\boxed{\\frac14}$."
