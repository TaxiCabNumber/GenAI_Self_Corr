At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe letters of the word `SIXTEEN' are randomly arranged.  What is the probability that the two E's are not next to each other?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are \\(17!\\) ways to arrange the letters of the word `SIXTEEN`.  If the two E's are next to each other, there are \\(15!\\) ways to arrange the remaining letters.  So there are \\(17!-15!\\) ways to arrange the letters of the word `SIXTEEN` so that the two E's are not next to each other.  Therefore, the probability that the two E's are not next to each other is \n$$\\frac{17!-15!}{17!}=\\frac{17\\cdot16!}{17!}=16.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$16$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\\dfrac{6!}{\\frac{7!}{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \\dfrac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{7}}$."
