At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBag A contains $3$ white and $2$ red balls. Bag B contains $6$ white and $3$ red balls. One of the two bags will be chosen at random, and then two balls will be drawn from that bag at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two balls drawn will be the same color? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        "ground_truth": "We need to use casework. Suppose first that bag A is chosen: there is a $1/2$ chance of this occurring. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = 10$ total ways to select two balls from bag A. If the two balls are the same color, then they must be either both white or both red. If both are white, then there are ${3\\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the two white balls, and if both are red, then there is $1$ way to pick the two red balls.
