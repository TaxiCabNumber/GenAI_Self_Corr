        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag contains 4 balls. Each ball is a single color, and 3 distinct colors are represented in the bag. What is the probability that the first 2 balls selected without replacement are the same color? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 4 balls in the bag, and 3 of them are of distinct colors.\n\n**Step 1: Find the probability of selecting the first ball of a particular color.**\n\nThere are 3 balls of distinct colors. So, the probability of selecting the first ball of a particular color is 3/4.\n\n**Step 2: Find the probability of selecting the second ball of the same color as the first ball.**\n\nAfter selecting the first ball, there are 3 balls left in the bag, and 2 of them are of the same color as the first ball. So, the probability of selecting the second ball of the same color as the first ball is 2/3.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the probabilities to find the overall probability.**\n\nThe probability of selecting the first 2 balls of the same color is the product of the probabilities of selecting each ball:\n\n$$(3/4) * (2/3) = 6/12 = 1/2$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{1/2}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are exactly ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs of balls that we can choose. Since there are only 4 balls, and 3 different colors, there is exactly one pair of same-colored balls. So, the probability of drawing this exact pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
