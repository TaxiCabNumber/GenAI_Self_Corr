The cubes of the first $n$ positive integers are $1,8,27,64,125,216, \\ldots, n^3$. The positive integers that are neither squares nor cubes are the positive integers that are not in either of the above lists. The first few of these numbers are $2,3,5,6,7,10,11, \\ldots$. The $n$th term of this sequence is the $n$th positive integer that is neither a square nor a cube.\nThe prime factorization of $n$ has the form $2^{a_1}3^{a_2}5^{a_3}7^{a_4} \\ldots$, where $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ are nonnegative integers. The number $n$ is a square if and only if $a_1$ is even. The number $n$ is a cube if and only if $a_2$ is even. The number $n$ is neither a square nor a cube if and only if $a_1$ and $a_2$ are both odd.\nThe $400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ positive integer with $a_1$ and $a_2$ both odd is the $400^{\\mathrm{th}}$ positive integer that is neither a square nor a cube.

        "ground_truth": "Let's try counting the number of perfect squares and cubes less than $441=21^2$. There are twenty perfect squares less than 441: $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 20^2$. There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \\ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.\n\nBut wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes. Thus, the $400^{\\text{th}}$ term is $\\boxed{425}$."
