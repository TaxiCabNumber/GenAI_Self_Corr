At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party?",
        "inference": "The subcommittee must have at least one Republican and one Democrat, so we can choose 1 Republican in 8 ways and 1 Democrat in 6 ways.  The remaining three members can be chosen from either party, so we can choose them in 14 ways.  Therefore, the total number of ways to form the subcommittee is \\(8 \\times 6 \\times 14 = 672\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{672}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $\\binom{14}{5}=2002$ ways of selecting a subcommittee of 5 with no restrictions on the membership. Of these committees, the only ones that will violate the given condition are the ones that consist entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats. There are $\\binom{8}{5}=56$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 8 Republicans and $\\binom{6}{5}=6$ possible subcommittees that have all 5 members selected from among the 6 Democrats. Subtracting the number of subcommittees that don't work from the total number of possible subcommittees gives us our answer: $2002-56-6=\\boxed{1940}$."
