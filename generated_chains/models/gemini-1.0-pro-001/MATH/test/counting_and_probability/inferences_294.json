        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many (non-congruent) isosceles triangles exist which have a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe perimeter of an isosceles triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. So, if the perimeter is 10, then the sum of the lengths of the two equal sides (legs) is 5.\n\nThe only way to represent 5 as the sum of two integers is 2 + 3. Therefore, the legs of the isosceles triangle must have lengths 2 and 3.\n\nThe length of the third side (base) of an isosceles triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two equal sides minus 2. So, the length of the base is 2 + 3 - 2 = 3.\n\nTherefore, there is only one (non-congruent) isosceles triangle with a perimeter of 10 and integer side lengths: a triangle with legs of length 2 and a base of length 3.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5."
