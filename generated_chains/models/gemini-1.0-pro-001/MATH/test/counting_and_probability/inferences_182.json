At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many positive integer values of $n$ is $3^n$ a factor of $15!$?",
        "inference": "Since $3^n$ is a factor of $15!$, then $3^n$ has to be a factor of $3 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9 \\cdots 15$.  Thus, all terms in this product must be divisible by $3^n$.  Since $12=3 \\cdot 4$ and $15=3 \\cdot 5$, the largest values of $n$ for which $3^n$ can divide both 12 and 15 is $n=2$.  The number of positive integer $n$ less than or equal to 2 is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We first determine the largest positive integer value of $n$ such that $3^n | 15!$. We determine this by counting the number of factors of 3 in the product.  There are 5 multiples of 3 in the product, and there is one extra factor of 3 in 9, so there are a total of  $5+ 1 = \\boxed{6}$ factors of 3 in the product of the first 15 integers. So, for all $n$ between 1 and 6, inclusive, $3^n$ is a factor of 15!."
