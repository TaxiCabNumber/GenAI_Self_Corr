At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA teacher has made ten statements for a True-False test. Four statements are true and six are false. How many distinct answer keys could there be for the test?",
