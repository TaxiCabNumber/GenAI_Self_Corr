At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA European train compartment has six seats.  Four of the seats are broken.  Wilhelm needs to fill out a form like the one here to indicate that there are broken seats.  If he randomly checks off four of the seats in the diagram, what is the probability that he marked the correct seats?
