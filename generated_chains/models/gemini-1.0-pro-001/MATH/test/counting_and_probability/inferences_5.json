At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmy's grandmother gave her 3 identical chocolate chip cookies and 4 identical sugar cookies.  In how many different orders can Amy eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both?",
        "inference": "First, we count the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie first.  There are 3 ways to choose which chocolate chip cookie she eats first.  Once she has chosen the first cookie, there are 7 cookies left.  She can eat them in 7! ways.  So, there are 3 * 7! = 3 * 5040 = 15120 ways to eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie first.\n\nNow, we count the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie last.  There are 3 ways to choose which chocolate chip cookie she eats last.  Once she has chosen the last cookie, there are 7 cookies left.  She can eat them in 7! ways.  So, there are 3 * 7! = 3 * 5040 = 15120 ways to eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie last.\n\nFinally, we count the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie both first and last.  There are 3 ways to choose which chocolate chip cookie she eats first and last.  Once she has chosen the first and last cookies, there are 5 cookies left.  She can eat them in 5! ways.  So, there are 3 * 5! = 3 * 120 = 360 ways to eat the cookies such that she eats a chocolate chip cookie both first and last.\n\nIn total, there are 15120 + 15120 + 360 = 30600 ways for Amy to eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30600}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\\dbinom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both."
