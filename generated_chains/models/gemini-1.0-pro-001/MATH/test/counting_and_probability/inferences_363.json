        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different numbers are randomly selected from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and they are multiplied. What is the probability that the product is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $4 \\cdot 3 = 12$ possible pairs of numbers that can be selected.\n\nThe pairs that result in an even product are $\\newline$\n$(1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)$\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a pair that results in an even product is $\\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ whose product is odd is $\\{1,3\\}$.  Since there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\\{1,3\\}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\\dfrac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{6}}$."
