At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 190 people on the beach.  110 are wearing sunglasses, 70 are wearing bathing suits, and 95 are wearing a hat.  Everyone is wearing at least one of these items. 30 are wearing both bathing suits and sunglasses. 25 are wearing both bathing suits and a hat. 40 are wearing both sunglasses and a hat.  How many people are wearing all three items?",
        "inference": "Let's represent the number of people wearing all three items as x.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n\n- 110 people are wearing sunglasses, so the number wearing only sunglasses is 110 - x - 40 = 70 - x.\n- 70 people are wearing bathing suits, so the number wearing only bathing suits is 70 - x - 30 = 40 - x.\n- 95 people are wearing hats, so the number wearing only hats is 95 - x - 40 = 55 - x.\n\nWe know that everyone is wearing at least one of these items, so the total number of people can be represented as:\n\n110 = 70 - x + 40 + x + 30 + 55 - x\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n110 = 195 - x\nSubtracting 195 from both sides, we get:\n\n-85 = -x\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n\nx = 85\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{85}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.\n\nTo find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.\n\nSince the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \\begin{align*}\n190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\\\\n&\\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\\\\n&= 180 + x.\n\\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \\boxed{10}$."
