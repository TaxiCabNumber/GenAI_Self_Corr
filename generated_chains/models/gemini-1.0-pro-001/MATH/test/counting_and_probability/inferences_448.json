At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "This is the probability of flipping no heads (three tails) or one head (two tails). This is the same as the probability of flipping two heads (one tail) or three heads (no tails), since we can just interchange heads and tails. Since all outcomes are covered, both probabilities add up to 1, so the desired probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
