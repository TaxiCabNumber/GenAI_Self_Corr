At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many primes are in the row of Pascal's Triangle that starts with a $1$ followed by a $6$?",

None of those is prime, so there are $\\boxed{0}$ prime numbers in the given row."
