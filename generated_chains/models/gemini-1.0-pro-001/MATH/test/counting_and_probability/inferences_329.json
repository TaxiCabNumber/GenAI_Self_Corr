At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn the student government ballot at Dusable High School, the six candidates for president are listed first, followed by the four candidates for vice president, followed by the five candidates for secretary and ending with the three candidates for treasurer. In how many ways can the candidates be listed on the ballot?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the number of ways the six candidates for president can be listed: 6! permutations\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the number of ways the four candidates for vice president can be listed: 4! permutations\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the number of ways the five candidates for secretary can be listed: 5! permutations\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the number of ways the three candidates for treasurer can be listed: 3! permutations\n\n**Step 5:** Multiply the number of ways each group can be listed to find the total number of ways the candidates can be listed on the ballot: 6! x 4! x 5! x 3!\n\n**Step 6:** Calculate the value of the expression: 6! x 4! x 5! x 3! = 172800\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{172800}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are six candidates for president, the presidential candidates can be ordered in $6! = 720$ ways. Likewise, there are $4! = 24$ vice presidential permutations. And $5! = 120$ secretarial permutations. Finally, $3! = 6$ treasurer permutations. We must multiply the number of permutations for each position, since each ballot includes all the position permutations: $720 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{12441600}$."
