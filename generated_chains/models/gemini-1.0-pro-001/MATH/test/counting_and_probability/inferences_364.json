        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNick, Janet, Huiju, and Amanda go to the World's Largest Brat Fest. Each of them is equally likely to order a meat brat, a hot dog, or a veggie brat. What is the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.\nEach person has 3 choices, so the total number of possible outcomes is 3^4 = 81.\n\n**Step 2**: Determine the number of outcomes where 2 people order a meat brat and the other two order hot dogs.\nThere are 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 people to order a meat brat, and 4 choose 2 = 6 ways to choose the other two people to order hot dogs. So, there are 6 * 6 = 36 outcomes where 2 people order a meat brat and the other two order hot dogs.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the probability.\nThe probability of 2 people ordering a meat brat and the other two ordering hot dogs is 36/81 = 4/9.\n\n**Final Answer:$\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{81}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{27}}$."
