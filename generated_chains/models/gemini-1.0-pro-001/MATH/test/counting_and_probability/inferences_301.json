At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 8 pens along a wall in the pound.  The pound has to allocate 4 pens to dogs, 3 to cats, and one to roosters.  In how many ways can the pound make the allocation?",

Cats: 4 ways to choose 3 pens from 4 pens, which is $4!/ (3!1!)= 4 * 3/1 = 12$\n\n3. Roosters: 1 pen\nso the total number of ways is $70 * 12 * 1 = 840$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{840}$.
