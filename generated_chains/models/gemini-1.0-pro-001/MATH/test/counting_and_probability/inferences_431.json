At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSeven cards each containing one of the following letters C, B, T, A, E, M and H are placed in a hat. Each letter is used only once. Stu will pull four cards out at random and without replacement. What is the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $7$ choices for the first card, $6$ choices for the second card, $5$ choices for the third card, and $4$ choices for the fourth card.\nSo, there are $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 840$ ways to choose $4$ cards from $7$ cards.\nAnd there is only $1$ way to choose $4$ cards M, A, T, H in this order.\nSo, the probability that Stu pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $\\frac{1}{840}$.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{840}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that Stu pulls the M out first is 1/7. The probability that he then pulls the A out next is 1/6, since there are now 6 letter remaining.  Continuing in this way, the probability that he pulls out T next is 1/5 and the probability that H then follows is 1/4.  Therefore, the probability that he pulls out M, A, T, H in this order is $1/7 \\times 1/6 \\times 1/5 \\times 1/4 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{840}}$."
