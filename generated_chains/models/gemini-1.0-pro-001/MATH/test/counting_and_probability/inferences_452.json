At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo numbers between $0$ and $1$ on a number line are to be chosen at random. What is the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit on the number line? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the first number chosen and $y$ be the second number chosen. Then the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\\frac 14$ unit on the number line is given by the integral:\n$$P(x,y>x+\\frac 14)=\\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 I (x,y>x+\\frac 14) \\ dx \\ dy,$$\nwhere $I (x,y>x+\\frac 14)$ is the indicator function which is equal to $1$ if $y>x+\\frac 14$ and $0$ otherwise. This integral can be evaluated as follows:\n$$\\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 I (x,y>x+\\frac 14) \\ dx \\ dy = \\int_0^1 \\int_{x+\\frac 14}^1 1 \\ dy \\ dx = \\int_0^1 \\left [y \\right ]_{x+\\frac 14}^1 dx = \\int_0^1 (1-x-\\frac 14) \\ dx = \\left [x-\\frac{x^2}2-\\frac{x}4 \\right ]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{4}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that the second number is more than $\\frac14$ unit greater than the first number decreases linearly from $\\frac34$ to $0$ as the first number increases linearly from $0$ to $\\frac34$. The average of this probability is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac34= \\frac38$. Since there is a $\\frac34$ chance of choosing a number from $0$ to $\\frac34$, the probability is $\\frac34 \\cdot \\frac38 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{32}}$."
