        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFruit salad can be made with any $3$ of these $5$ fruits: apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and pineapples. If strawberries and pineapples do not taste good together and grapes and bananas do not look appetizing together, how many possible good tasting and appetizing salads are there?",
        "inference": "First, we need to find the number of ways to choose $3$ fruits from $5$. This can be done using combinations, which is given by $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $r$ is the number of items to choose. In this case, $n=5$ and $r=3$, so the number of ways to choose $3$ fruits from $5$ is $\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{5\\times4\\times3!}{3!\\times2} = 10$.\n\nNext, we need to remove the cases where strawberries and pineapples are chosen together, and where grapes and bananas are chosen together. The number of ways to choose strawberries and pineapples together is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$. The number of ways to choose grapes and bananas together is also $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$. Therefore, the total number of cases to remove is $1+1 = 2$.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the number of cases to remove from the total number of ways to choose $3$ fruits. This gives us the number of possible good tasting and appetizing salads, which is $10-2 = 8$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \\boxed{4}$ such salads are possible."
