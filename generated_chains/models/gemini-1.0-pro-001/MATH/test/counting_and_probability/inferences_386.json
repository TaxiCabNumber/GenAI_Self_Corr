        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nAlice and Bob can be seated in 7! ways.\nThe remaining 6 people can be seated in 6! ways.\nTherefore, the total number of ways to seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other is 7! * 6! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 20160.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20160}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 5 \\times 6!}{8} = 5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \\times 6! = \\boxed{3600}$."
