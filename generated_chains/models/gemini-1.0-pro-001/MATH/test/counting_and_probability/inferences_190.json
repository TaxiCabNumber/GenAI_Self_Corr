Then, there are $4$ choices $(A,$ $R,$ $G,$ or $E)$ for the second slot and $3$ for the third, giving a total of $3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 36$ sequences.\n\n$\\bullet$ Case II: Exactly two Ts in the sequence. There are $3$ slots in which the non-$T$ can be placed, and there are $4$ possibilities for the letter choice.
