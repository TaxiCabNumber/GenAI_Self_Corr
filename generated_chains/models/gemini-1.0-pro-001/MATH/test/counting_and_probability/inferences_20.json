At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to arrange 6 people around a circular table with 7 seats?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
