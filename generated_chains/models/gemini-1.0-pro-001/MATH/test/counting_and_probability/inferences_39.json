I hope it is correct.'\nA restaurant offers three desserts, and exactly twice as many appetizers as main courses. A dinner consists of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert. What is the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer so that a customer could have a different dinner each night in the year 2003?",
        "inference": "To find the least number of main courses that the restaurant should offer, we need to determine the total number of different dinners that can be created with the given choices.\n\nSince the number of appetizers is twice the number of main courses, and we have three dessert options, the total number of different dinners is:\n\n(Number of main courses) x (2 x Number of main courses) x (3)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n(Number of main courses) x (6)\n\nTo have a different dinner each night in the year 2003, the restaurant should offer a number of main courses that allows for at least 365 different dinners.\n\nSo, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n(Number of main courses) x (6) >= 365\n\nDividing both sides by 6:\n\nNumber of main courses >= 365 / 6\n\nNumber of main courses >= 60.83\n\nSince the restaurant cannot offer a fraction of a main course, the least number of main courses it should offer is the ceiling of 60.83, which is 61.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$61$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $m$ denote the number of main courses needed to meet the requirement. Then the number of dinners available is $3\\cdot m \\cdot 2m = 6m^2$.  Thus $m^2$ must be at least $365/6 \\approx 61$.  Since $7^2 = 49<61<64 = 8^2$, $\\boxed{8}$ main courses is enough, but 7 is not."
