At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 6 girls and 2 boys sit in a row if the 2 boys insist on sitting next to each other?",
        "inference": "Firstly, consider the 2 boys as one unit. Then there are 7 units (6 girls and 1 unit of 2 boys) that can be arranged in 7! ways. However, the 2 boys within their unit can be arranged in 2! ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is:\nTotal arrangements = 7! x 2!\n= 5040 x 2\n= 10080\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10080$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can consider the two boys as one person, arrange the ``seven'' people first, then arrange the 2 boys.  So the number of seating arrangements in which the boys sit together is $7!\\times 2!=\\boxed{10,\\!080}$."
