I hope it is correct.'\nPat wants to select 8 pieces of fruit to bring in the car for the people he's driving to Montana with. He randomly chooses each piece of fruit to be an orange, an apple, or a banana. What is the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability of each outcome.\n\n- The probability of selecting 3 oranges is $\\binom{8}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 = 0.2032$.\n- The probability of selecting 6 apples is $\\binom{8}{6}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = 0.0908$.\n\n**Step 2:** Add the probabilities of the two outcomes.\n\n- The probability of either 3 oranges or 6 apples is $0.2032 + 0.0908 = 0.294$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{0.294}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^5=\\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\\cdot\\dfrac{32}{6561}=\\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^6\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{6561}=\\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\\dfrac{112}{6561}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$."
