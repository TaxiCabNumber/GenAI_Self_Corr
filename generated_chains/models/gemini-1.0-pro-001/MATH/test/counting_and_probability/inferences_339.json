At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMaria has three identical apples and three identical oranges. How many ways are there for her to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges?  (Note: Maria takes none of the fruit herself, and some of her friends might not receive any fruit at all.)",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** We can first distribute the apples. There are 4 possibilities for who gets the first apple, 3 possibilities for who gets the second apple, and 2 possibilities for who gets the third apple. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to distribute the apples.\n\n**Step 2:** Now we need to distribute the oranges to the three friends who got apples. There are 3 possibilities for who gets the first orange, 2 possibilities for who gets the second orange, and 1 possibility for who gets the third orange. So there are $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to distribute the oranges.\n\n**Step 3:** Finally, we need to multiply the number of ways to distribute the apples by the number of ways to distribute the oranges. So there are $24 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{144}$ ways for Maria to distribute the fruits among her four friends if she doesn't give Jacky any oranges.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{144}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, just consider the apples. Imagine putting three dividers among the apples, so that Maria's first friend gets the apples to the left of the first divider, Maria's second friend gets the apples between the first and second dividers, Maria's third friend gets the apples between the second and third dividers, and Maria's last friend gets the apples after the third divider. With three dividers and three apples, there are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to arrange the dividers. Now, consider the oranges. Since Maria won't give Jacky any oranges, Maria has to distribute the oranges among her other three friends. With three oranges and two dividers, there are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways for Maria to distribute the oranges. The total number of ways for Maria to distribute the fruit is $20\\cdot 10=\\boxed{200}$."
