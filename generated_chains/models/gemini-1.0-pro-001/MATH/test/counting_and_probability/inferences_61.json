        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI draw a card from a standard 52-card deck.  If I draw an Ace, I win 1 dollar.  If I draw a 2 through 10, I win a number of dollars equal to the value of the card.  If I draw a face card (Jack, Queen, or King), I win 20 dollars.  If I draw a $\\clubsuit$, my winnings are doubled, and if I draw a $\\spadesuit$, my winnings are tripled.  (For example, if I draw the $8\\clubsuit$, then I win 16 dollars.)  What would be a fair price to pay to play the game?  Express your answer as a dollar value rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nYour answer should be a number with two digits after the decimal point, like $21.43$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Price for drawing Ace $= 1$ dollar.\n**Step 2**: Price for drawing 2 through 10 = (Ace price + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) / 10 = $5.50\n**Step 3**: Price for drawing face card = $20\n**Step 4**: Total price without multiplier = $1 + $5.50 + $20 = $26.50\n**Step 5**: Price for drawing $\\clubsuit$ x 2 = $26.50 x 2 = $53\n**Step 6**: Price for drawing $\\spadesuit$ x 3 = $26.50 x 3 = $79.50\n**Step 7**: Total price with multiplier = (Total price without multiplier + $53 + $79.50) / 3 = $53\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$53}.

        "ground_truth": "Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\\heartsuit$ or $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \\[ E_1 = \\frac{1}{13}(\\$1+\\$2+\\cdots+\\$10+(3\\times\\$20)) = \\$\\frac{115}{13}. \\]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \\[ E = \\frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \\frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\\$\\frac{805}{52}}, \\]or about $\\boxed{\\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game."
