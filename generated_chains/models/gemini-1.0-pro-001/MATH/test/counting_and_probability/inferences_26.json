How many increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers have a sum of 33?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nLet $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ be the five single-digit positive integers in an increasing list.\n\nThen we have the following system of equations:\n\n$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 33$$\n\n$$x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$$\n\nSince $x_1$ must be a positive single-digit integer, we have $x_1 \\geq 1$.  Since $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 33$, we have $x_5 \\leq 33 - 1 = 32$.  Since $x_5$ is a positive single-digit integer, we have $x_5 \\leq 9$.  Therefore, we have $1 \\leq x_1 \\leq 9$.\n\nIf $x_1 = 1$, then $x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 32$.  Since $x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$, the only possible solution is $x_2 = 2, x_3 = 3, x_4 = 4, x_5 = 23$.  However, $23$ is not a single-digit integer, so there are no increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers with a sum of $33$ that begin with $1$.\n\nIf $x_1 = 2$, then $x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 31$.  Since $x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$, the only possible solutions are $x_2 = 3, x_3 = 4, x_4 = 5, x_5 = 19$ and $x_2 = 3, x_3 = 4, x_4 = 6, x_5 = 18$.  However, $19$ and $18$ are not single-digit integers, so there are no increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers with a sum of $33$ that begin with $2$.\n\nIf $x_1 = 3$, then $x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 30$.  Since $x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$, the only possible solutions are $x_2 = 4, x_3 = 5, x_4 = 6, x_5 = 15$ and $x_2 = 4, x_3 = 5, x_4 = 7, x_5 = 14$.  However, $15$ and $14$ are not single-digit integers, so there are no increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers with a sum of $33$ that begin with $3$.\n\nIf $x_1 = 4$, then $x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 29$.  Since $x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$, the only possible solutions are $x_2 = 5, x_3 = 6, x_4 = 7, x_5 = 11$ and $x_2 = 5, x_3 = 6, x_4 = 8, x_5 = 10$.  However, $11$ and $10$ are not single-digit integers, so there are no increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers with a sum of $33$ that begin with $4$.\n\nIf $x_1 = 5$, then $x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 28$.  Since $x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$, the only possible solution is $x_2 = 6, x_3 = 7, x_4 = 8, x_5 = 7$.  However, $7$ appears twice in the list, so there are no increasing lists of five different single-digit positive integers with a sum of $33$ that",
        "ground_truth": "After some trial and error, we obtain the two lists $\\{4,5,7,8,9\\}$ and $\\{3,6,7,8,9\\}$.\n\nWhy are these the only two?\n\nIf the largest number of the five integers was 8, then the largest that the sum could be would be $8+7+6+5+4=30$, which is too small.  This tells us that we must include one 9 in the list.  (We cannot include any number larger than 9, since each number must be a single-digit number.)\n\nTherefore, the sum of the remaining four numbers is $33-9=24$.\n\nIf the largest of the four remaining numbers is 7, then their largest possible sum would be $7+6+5+4=22$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 8 in the list.\n\nThus, the sum of the remaining three numbers is $24-8=16$.\n\nIf the largest of the three remaining numbers is 6, then their largest possible sum would be $6+5+4=15$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 7 in the list.\n\nThus, the sum of the remaining two numbers is $16-7=9$.\n\nThis tells us that we need two different positive integers, each less than 7, that add to 9.  These must be 3 and 6 or 4 and 5.\n\nThis gives us the two lists above, and shows that they are the only two such lists.  The answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
