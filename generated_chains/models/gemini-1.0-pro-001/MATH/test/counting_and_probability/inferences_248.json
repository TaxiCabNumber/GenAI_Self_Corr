At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDuring the school year, the 10 members of the chess club play a total of 900 games of chess during their practice matches. Each member plays against every other member $N$ times. What is the value of $N$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe total number of games that can be played between two players = $N$\nTotal pairs of players = $\\frac{10 \\times 9}{2}=45$\nTotal number of games played by each member against other members = $N \\times 45$\nTotal number of games played by all 10 members = $10 \\times N \\times 45$\n\nGiven that the total number of games played is 900, we can write:\n\n$10 \\times N \\times 45=900$\n$N \\times 450=900$\n$N=\\frac{900}{450}$\n$N=2$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since there are 10 club members, there are $\\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10\\cdot 9}{2} = 45$ pairings of members.  Thus, each pair must have played $\\frac{900}{45} = \\boxed{20}$ games."
