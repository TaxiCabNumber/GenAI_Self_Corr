        "inference": "In order to get from $A$ to $B$, we need to move $w+h-2$ times: $h-1$ up and $w-1$ right. Hence, the number of paths is the number of ways to choose which of the $w+h-2$ moves are up. That is, we need to choose $h-1$ out of a total of $w+h-2$ moves to be up, which can be done in  $\\binom{(w+h-2)}{(h-1)}$ ways.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\binom{(w+h-2)}{(h-1)} = \\frac{(w+h-2)!}{(h-1)!(w-1)!}$.
