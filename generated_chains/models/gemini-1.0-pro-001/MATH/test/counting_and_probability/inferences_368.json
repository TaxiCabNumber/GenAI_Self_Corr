        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are 360 people in my school.  15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them.  180 take calculus.  Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.  75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry.  Only 30 take both physics and calculus.  How many students take physics?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of students who take physics.\nThen, the number of students who take chemistry is 2x.\nThe number of students who take only calculus is 180 - 30 - 75 = 75.\nThe number of students who take only chemistry is 2x - 75 - 15 = 2x - 90.\nThe number of students who take only physics is x - 30 - 75 = x - 105.\nThe number of students who take none of the three subjects is 15.\nTherefore, the total number of students is\n15 + x + 2x + 75 + 2x - 90 + x - 105 = 360.\nSimplifying, we get\n5x - 115 = 360.\nAdding 115 to both sides, we get\n5x = 475.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get\nx = **95**.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$95$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \\[\n(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.\n\\] We solve for $x$ and find that the number of physics students is $x = \\boxed{110}$."
