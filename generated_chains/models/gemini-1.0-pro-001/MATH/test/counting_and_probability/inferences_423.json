At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA license plate consists of two letters followed by two digits; for example, $MP78$. Neither the digits nor the letters may be repeated, and neither the letter $O$ nor the digit $0$ may be used. When reading from left to right, the letters must be in alphabetical order and the digits must be in increasing order. How many different license plate combinations are possible?",
        "inference": "1. The first letter can be chosen in 26 ways (A to Z, excluding O).\n\n\n2. The second letter can be chosen in 25 ways (A to Z, excluding O and the first letter).\n\n\n3. The first digit can be chosen in 9 ways (1 to 9, excluding 0).\n\n\n4. The second digit can be chosen in 8 ways (1 to 9, excluding 0 and the first digit).\n\n\n5. The total number of different license plate combinations is the product of these four numbers: \n$26 \\times 25 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 46800$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{46800}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Given any set of two distinct letters (neither of which is O) and two distinct digits (neither of which is 0), we can build exactly one license plate because, whatever the letters and digits, there is only one allowed order.  We can choose two distinct letters (excluding O) in $\\binom{25}{2}$ ways and two distinct digits (excluding 0) in $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways.  Thus the total number of license plates is $\\binom{25}{2}\\binom{9}{2} = \\boxed{10800}$."
