At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top two cards are both Aces?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: There are 52 ways to select the first card.\n\n**Step 2**: Once the first card is selected, there are 3 Aces remaining from the 51 remaining cards.\n\n**Step 3**: Therefore, there are 52 * 3 ways to select the first two Aces.\n\n**Step 4**: There are 52 * 51 ways to select any two cards from the 52.\n\n**Step 5**: Therefore, the probability of obtaining Aces as the top two cards is obtained by dividing Step 3 with Step 4.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{51}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 ways to choose the first card to be an Ace, then 3 ways to choose the second card to be another Ace.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{4 \\times 3}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{221}}$."
