        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarkov plays a game for three turns. On each turn, he either rolls a fair, six sided die or flips a fair coin. If he rolls a 1 or 2 on the die, he will switch to the coin on the next turn, and if he flips a tails on the coin, he will switch to the die on the next turn. If Markov starts by rolling the die, what is the probability that he will flip the coin on the third turn?",
        "inference": "In the first turn, there's a $\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}$ chance that he will switch to the coin. In the second turn, if he rolled the die in the first turn, there's a $\\frac{2}{6}\\times\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{9}$ chance he'll switch to the coin; if he flipped the coin in the first turn, there's a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that he'll switch to the die. In the third turn, if he rolled the die in the first turn, there's a $\\frac{2}{6}\\times\\frac{2}{6}\\times\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{54}$ chance he'll flip the coin. If he flipped the coin in the first turn, there's a $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that he'll flip the coin again. There's also a $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that he'll switch to the die, roll a 1 or 2, and then flip the coin in the third turn. So, the total probability that he'll flip the coin in the third turn is $\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\\frac{4}{6}\\cdot \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{2}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{18}}$."
