A factorial is divisible by 9 if and only if the product of its digits is divisible by 9.  The product of the digits of a factorial is divisible by 9 if and only if the number of 9's in the prime factorization of the factorial is at least 2.  The prime factorization of n! is 2^a 3^b 5^c 7^d ..., where a, b, c, d, ... are nonnegative integers.

The first such $n$ for which this is true is 6, since  $6! = \\textbf{6} \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times \\textbf{3} \\times 2 \\times 1$.  Since 9 is a factor of $6!$ and $6!$ is a factor of $n!$ for all $n \\ge 6$, the numbers $6!, 7!, 8!, \\ldots, 99!, 100!$ are all divisible by 9.
