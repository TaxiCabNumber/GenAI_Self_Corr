At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)",
        "inference": "Since there are 2 people on a side, the table can be divided into 4 sections.  If we seat someone in the first section, then there are 7 remaining people, of whom 2 must be seated in that section.  There are 5 remaining people, of whom 2 must be seated in the second section.  There are 3 remaining people, of whom 2 must be seated in the third section.  There is only 1 person left, who must be seated in the fourth section.  Therefore, there are $8\\cdot 7\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 1 = 840$ ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$840$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 4 times (if you move each person 2, 4, or 6 places clockwise you get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{4} = \\boxed{10080}$."
