        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct values are possible for the expression $8 + 4 \\times 6 \\div 2$ if one set of parentheses may be placed in the expression?",

        "ground_truth": "Without parentheses, the expression has the value (following order of operations) $8 + (4 \\times 6)/2 = 20$. The parentheses can modify the order of operations, either through $(8+4) \\times 6 \\div 2 = 36$ or $(8 + 4 \\times 6)/2 = 16$, giving $\\boxed{3}$ distinct values. (Note that placing parentheses that exclude the first number doesn't affect the result, since the only important order of operations here is multiplication before addition.)"
