At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair and six-sevenths of his students are right-handed.  If Mr. Shearer's class has 28 students, what is the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair?",
        "inference": "1. Three-fourths of the students in Mr. Shearer's class have brown hair, so 28 * 3/4 = 21 students have brown hair.\n2. Six-sevenths of his students are right-handed, so 28 * 6/7 = 24 students are right-handed.\n3. The smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is the greatest common factor of 21 and 24, which is 3.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Mr. Shearer has $\\frac{3}{4}(28)=21$ students with brown hair and $\\frac{6}{7}(28)=24$ students who are right-handed.  Since there are $28-24=4$ left-handed students, at most 4 of the 21 brown-haired students are left-handed.  Therefore, at least $\\boxed{17}$ of them are right-handed."
