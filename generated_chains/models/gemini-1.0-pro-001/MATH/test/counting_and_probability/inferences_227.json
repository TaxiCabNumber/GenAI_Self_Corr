At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable and the boxes are distinguishable?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe have 3 boxes and 5 balls. For the first ball, there are 3 choices of boxes. For the second ball, there are 3 choices of boxes. For the third ball, there are 3 choices of boxes. For the fourth ball, there are 3 choices of boxes. For the fifth ball, there are 3 choices of boxes.\nTherefore, the number of ways to put 5 balls in 3 boxes is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 3^5 = \\boxed{243}.$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$243$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 3 different boxes, so each of the 5 balls can be placed in three different locations.  So the answer is $3^5 = \\boxed{243}$."
