At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlyssa has four marbles: a red one, a blue one, a green one, and a yellow one. In how many different ways can she form a set consisting of some of the marbles if she must choose at least one marble?  (In a set of chosen marbles, it does not matter in what order she chose the marbles.)",
        "inference": "She can choose 1 of the 4 marbles, or 2 of the 4 marbles, or 3 of the 4 marbles, or all 4 of the 4 marbles.  The number of ways to choose 1 of the 4 marbles is 4. The number of ways to choose 2 of the 4 marbles is 4 x 3 / 2 = 6. The number of ways to choose 3 of the 4 marbles is 4 x 3 x 2 / 3 x 2 x 1 = 4. The number of ways to choose 4 of the 4 marbles is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 / 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 1.  So the number of different ways she can form a set consisting of some of the marbles if she must choose at least one marble is 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 15.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the four marbles can either be in Alyssa's set, or not.  That gives two possibilities for each marble, for a total of $2^4=16$ possible sets.  However, we are told the set must have at least one marble.  We need to subtract one to eliminate the case of an empty set, which we counted.  Our final answer is $16-1=\\boxed{15}$ sets."
