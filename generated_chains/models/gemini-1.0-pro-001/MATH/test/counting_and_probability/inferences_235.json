At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKrishanu and Shaunak each pick an integer at random between 1 and 10, inclusive. What is the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The product of two numbers is greater than 10 if both numbers are greater than 1. Therefore, we need to find the probability that both numbers are greater than 1.\n\nThere are 9 numbers greater than 1 between 1 and 10, inclusive. Therefore, the probability that Krishanu picks a number greater than 1 is 9/10. The probability that Shaunak picks a number greater than 1 is also 9/10.\n\nThe probability that both Krishanu and Shaunak pick a number greater than 1 is (9/10) * (9/10) = 81/100.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is more than 10 is 81/100.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{81}{100}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\\boxed{\\frac{73}{100}}$."
