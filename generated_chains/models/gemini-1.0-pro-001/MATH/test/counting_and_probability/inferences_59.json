At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTen people are sitting around a round table.  Three of them are chosen at random to give a presentation.  What is the probability that the three chosen people were sitting in consecutive seats?",
        "inference": "First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 10.  This is $$C(10,3)=\\frac{10!}{3!7!}=\\frac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8}{3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=120.$$ Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people.  This is simply the number of ways to choose the first person, which is 10, times the number of ways to choose the next two people, which is 2. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive people is 10*2=20. So the probability of choosing 3 consecutive people is 20/120 = 1/6.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1/6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{120} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{12}}$."
