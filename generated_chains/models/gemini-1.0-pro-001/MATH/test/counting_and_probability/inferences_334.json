At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJulie baked cupcakes for her family at home and for a party at school. She iced 4 cupcakes with red frosting, 2 cupcakes with orange frosting, 2 with yellow, 2 with green, 3 with blue and the last 3 with violet frosting. Each cupcake is iced with exactly one color of frosting. Julie plans to take exactly 10 of the cupcakes to her party, and will take either all of the cupcakes of a particular color or none of the cupcakes of that color. How many different combinations of cupcakes could she take to her party?",

        "ground_truth": "If Julie includes one of the colors that cover three cupcakes, she must also include the other color that covers three cupcakes. This is because she must make ten cupcakes total, and all of the other colors cover an even number of cupcakes, so there is no way to make ten with three and some combination of even numbers. Thus, if she includes blue and violet, she has four cupcakes left to choose. There are three ways in which she can choose four cupcakes if she chooses colors that cover two (green and orange, green and yellow, or orange and yellow). Alternately, she can choose a color that covers four (red). Finally, if she doesn't include any colors that cover three cupcakes, she must choose all of the other cupcakes in order to make ten. Thus, Julie has $\\boxed{5}$ different combinations of cupcakes."
