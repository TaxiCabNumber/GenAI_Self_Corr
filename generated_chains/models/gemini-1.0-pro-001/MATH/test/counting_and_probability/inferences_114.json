At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 8 different people be seated around a round table with 8 places? Two seatings are considered equivalent if one can be rotated to form the other.",
        "inference": "There are 7 choices for who to seat next to the first person, 6 choices for who to seat next to the second person, and so on. So there are $$7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$$ ways to seat 8 people around a round table if no two seatings are considered equivalent.\nBut because a round table has no head or foot, any seating can be rotated to form 7 other equivalent seatings. So the number of inequivalent seatings is $$\\frac{5040}{8} = 630$$\nFinal Answer: $$ \\boxed{630} $$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $8!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 8 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{8!}{8} = 7! = \\boxed{5040}$."
