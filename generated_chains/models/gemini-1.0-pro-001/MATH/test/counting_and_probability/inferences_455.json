        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have two cubes such that, on each cube, three faces are painted red and three faces are painted white. If I roll each of the cubes once, what is the probability that they will land such that there is one red face and one white face up?",
        "inference": "The probability of rolling a red face on the first cube is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling a white face on the second cube is also 1/2. The probability of rolling a red face on the first cube and a white face on the second cube is (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nAlternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
