At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA senate committee has 5 Republicans and 4 Democrats.  In how many ways can the committee members sit in a row of 9 chairs, such that all 4 Democrats sit together?",
        "inference": "The Democrats can be thought of as one block of 4 chairs.  The Republicans and the block can be arranged in 6! ways.  The Democrats within their block can be arranged in 4! ways.  Thus, the total number of ways the committee members can sit is\n$$6!\\cdot 4! = 6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1 \\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot2\\cdot 1 = 2880.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2880}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we consider the group of Democrats as one person, then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 people (the 5 Republicans and the one Democrat group). Then there are $4!$ ways to arrange arranging the 4 Democrats within their group.  So the number of arrangements is $6! \\times 4! = \\boxed{17,\\!280}$."
