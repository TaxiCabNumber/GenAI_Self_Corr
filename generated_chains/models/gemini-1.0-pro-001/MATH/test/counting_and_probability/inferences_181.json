At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many different three-digit odd numbers can be formed using the digits 3, 4, 5 and 6 if digits cannot be repeated?",
        "inference": "We can choose any of the given 4 digits to occupy the hundreds place, 3 digits for the tens place, and 2 digits for the units place.\n\nSo, the number of different three-digit odd numbers = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Begin by constructing the number from the units digit and working up to the hundreds digit. There are two possible choices for the units digit: $3$ and $5$ (since the number must be odd). Then, after choosing that digit, there are three possible choices for the tens digit ($4$, $6$, and the remaining odd digit), since digits cannot be repeated. Finally, there are then two possible choices for the hundreds digit. Thus, there are $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ such numbers that can be formed."
