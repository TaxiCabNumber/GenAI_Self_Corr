        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put five beads on a necklace if there are eight distinct beads to choose from, and rotations and reflections of the necklace are considered the same?",
        "inference": "First, we find the total number of ways to put five beads on a necklace, regardless of rotations and reflections. This is just $8^5 = 32,768$.\n\nNext, we find the number of ways to rotate the necklace. This is just 5, since the necklace can be rotated five times before it returns to its original position.\n\nFinally, we find the number of ways to reflect the necklace. This is also just 2, since the necklace can be reflected across any of its two axes of symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to put five beads on a necklace, considering rotations and reflections, is $32,768/(5 \\cdot 2) = 3,276$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3,276}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4/10=\\boxed{672}$."
