At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many positive integers less than 2008 have an even number of divisors?",
        "inference": "1. The smallest positive integer with an even number of divisors is 4, since 4 has the divisors 1, 2, 4.\n\n2. To find the next integer, you need to find the next smallest perfect square, which is 9.\n9 has the divisors 1, 3, 9.\n\n3. To find the third smallest integer, you need to find the next number whose square has an even number of divisors. This would be 16, which has the divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.\n\n4. From here, the pattern continues for every perfect square. The next smallest perfect square after 16 is 25, which has the divisors 1, 5, 25.\n\n5.

        "ground_truth": "A number $n$ has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. To see this, notice that the divisors $d$ and $n/d$ pair up, except for when $d=n/d$, or $n=d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the only integers not counted are the perfect squares. Since $45^2=2025$ and $44^2=1936$, there are 44 positive integers less than 2008 with an odd number of divisors, leaving $2007-44=\\boxed{1963}$ positive integers less than 2008 with an even number of divisors."
