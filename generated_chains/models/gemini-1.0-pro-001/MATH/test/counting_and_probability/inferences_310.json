At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo fair eight-sided dice have their faces numbered from 1 to 8. What is the expected value of the sum of the rolls of both dice?",
        "inference": "Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) be the random variables that represent the outcomes of rolling the first and second dice, respectively. Then, the sum of the rolls of both dice is \\(S = X + Y\\). The expected value of \\(S\\) is given by\n$$E(S) = E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$$\nSince \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are identically distributed, \\(E(X) = E(Y)\\). To find \\(E(X)\\), we need to calculate the probability mass function of \\(X\\). The probability of rolling any number on a fair eight-sided die is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\). Therefore, the probability mass function of \\(X\\) is given by \\(P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{8}\\) for \\(x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\). The expected value of \\(X\\) is then given by\n$$E(X) = \\sum_{x=1}^8 xP(X = x) = \\sum_{x=1}^8 x \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{x=1}^8 x = \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{8 \\cdot 9}{2} = 4.5$$\nTherefore, \\(E(S) = E(X) + E(Y) = 4.5 + 4.5 = 9\\).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the expected value of a double roll, we can simply add the expected values of the individual rolls, giving $4.5 + 4.5 = \\boxed{9}$."
