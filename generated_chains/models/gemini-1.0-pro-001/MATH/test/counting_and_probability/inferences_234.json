At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that I have 6 different books, 2 of which are math books.  In how many ways can I stack my 6 books on a shelf if I want a math book on both ends of the stack?",

Once the second book is chosen, there are 4 ways to choose a third book.  Once the third book is chosen, there are 3 ways to choose a fourth book.  Once the fourth book is chosen, there are 2 ways to choose a fifth book.  Once the fifth book is chosen, there is only 1 way to choose a sixth book.  Therefore, there are a total of 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720 ways to stack the books.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{720}. I hope it is correct.",

Then we place the four other books in the middle.  There are 4 choices for the first book, 3 choices for the second, 2 choices for the third, and only 1 choice for the fourth.  So the total number of ways the books can be placed is $2 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\boxed{48}$."
