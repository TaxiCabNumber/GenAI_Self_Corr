What is the probability that he flips over the ace of spades before any face card (jack, queen or king)?",
        "inference": "There are 4 face cards in a deck of 52 cards. So the probability of flipping over a face card is 4/52 = 1/13. The probability of flipping over the ace of spades is 1/52.\n\nThe probability of flipping over the ace of spades before any face card is the probability of flipping over the ace of spades multiplied by the probability of not flipping over a face card in the next 12 flips. The probability of not flipping over a face card in the next 12 flips is (48/52)^12 = (6/13)^12.\n\nSo the probability of flipping over the ace of spades before any face card is (1/52) * (6/13)^12 = 0.00053665.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0.00053665}. I hope it is correct.",
