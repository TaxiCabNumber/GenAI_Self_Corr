        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first six rows of Pascal's triangle are shown below, beginning with row 0.\n\nHow many of the first 100 rows contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than $1$? (Rows 2 and 4 have this property, for example.)\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n&&&&&1&&&&&\\\\\n&&&&1&&1&&&&\\\\\n&&&1&&2&&1&&&\\\\\n&&1&&3&&3&&1&&\\\\\n&1&&4&&6&&4&&1&\\\\\n1&&5&&10&&10&&5&&1\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
        "inference": "The $n$th row of Pascal's triangle contains $n+1$ entries, the first and last of which are always $1$. The remaining $n-1$ entries are given by the formula ${{n} \\choose {k-1}}$ for $k=2, 3, \\ldots, n$. By the binomial theorem, we know that if $n$ is even, then all of the binomial coefficients ${{n} \\choose {k}}$ are even, so the entire $n$th row is even. If $n$ is odd, then only the binomial coefficient ${{n} \\choose {n/2}}$ is odd, so the $n$th row contains exactly one odd entry. Thus, the only rows of the first 100 rows that contain at least one even entry and no odd entries other than $1$ are the even rows. There are $100/2 = 50$ even rows in the first 100 rows, so the answer is $\\boxed{50}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{50}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Starting with row $0$, the $k^\\text{th}$ row has the numbers \\[\\binom{k}{0},\\binom{k}{1},\\binom{k}{2},\\ldots,\\binom{k}{k} .\\]For every number in the row except the first and last values to be even, $k$ must only have even factors, so it must be a power of $2$. Since the highest power of $2$ under $100$ is $2^6=64$, $\\boxed{6}$ of the first 100 rows have only even numbers besides $1$."
