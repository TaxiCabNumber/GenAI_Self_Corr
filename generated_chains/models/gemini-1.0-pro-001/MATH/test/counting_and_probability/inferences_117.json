At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "A face of a six-sided dice can have six different values. When you roll three dice, there are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes.\n\nLet's consider the outcomes in which at least two of the faces match. There are three cases to consider:\n\n1. Two of the faces match and the third face is different. There are $6 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 180$ such outcomes.\n2. Two of the faces match and the third face is the same as one of the matching faces. There are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ such outcomes.\n3. All three faces match. There are $6$ such outcomes.\n\nAdding up the number of outcomes in these three cases, we get $180 + 30 + 6 = 216$. Therefore, the probability of getting at least two matching faces when rolling three fair six-sided dice is $\\frac{216}{216} = \\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\\times\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\\frac{5}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$."
