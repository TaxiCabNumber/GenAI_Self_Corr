At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
        "inference": "There are 2 choices for the first ball, 2 choices for the second ball, 2 choices for the third ball, 2 choices for the fourth ball, and 2 choices for the fifth ball. Therefore, there are $2^5=32$ ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{32}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since both the balls and boxes are indistinguishable, we can arrange them with 5 in one and 0 in the other, 4 in one and 1 in the other, or 3 in one and 2 in the other, for a total of $\\boxed{3}$ different arrangements."
