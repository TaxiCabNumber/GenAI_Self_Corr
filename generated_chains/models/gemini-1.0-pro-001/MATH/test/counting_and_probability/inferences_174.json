At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere are seven wombats in a council. Three of them are hairy-nosed wombats, while the rest are all different species. If the hairy-nosed wombats are indistinguishable but the other wombats are, how many ways can the wombats seat themselves in a row?",
