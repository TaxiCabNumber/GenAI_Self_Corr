The smallest three-digit positive integer is 100, and 11 x 9 = 99, so the smallest three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 11 x 10 = 110.\nNext, let's find the largest three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11. The largest three-digit positive integer is 999, and 11 x 90 = 990, so the largest three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 990.\nNow, we can find the number of three-digit positive integers that are multiples of 11 by subtracting the smallest from the largest and adding 1:\n990 - 110 + 1 = 90\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{90}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first three-digit positive integer that is a multiple of 11 is 110, which is $11\\times 10$.  The last is 990, which is $11\\times 90$.  So, the number of three-digit multiples of 11 is the same as the number of numbers in the list $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 90$, which is $90-10+1 = \\boxed{81}$."
