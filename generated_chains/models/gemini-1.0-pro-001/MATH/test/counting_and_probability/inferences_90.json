        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy state's lottery has 30 white balls numbered from 1 through 30 and 20 red balls numbered from 1 through 20.  In each lottery drawing, 3 of the white balls and 2 of the red balls are drawn.  To win, you must match all 3 white balls and both red balls, without regard to the order in which they were drawn.  How many possible different combinations may be drawn?",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose 3 white balls from 30 is C(30, 3) = 4060.\nThe number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 20 is C(20, 2) = 190.\nSo the number of possible different combinations is 4060 * 190 = 771400.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{771400}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 30 ways to draw the first white ball, 29 ways to draw the second, and 28 ways to draw the third.  However, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $3!$ to get $\\dfrac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3!} = 4060$ ways to draw three white balls.  There are 20 ways to draw the first red ball and 19 ways to draw the second, however, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $2!$ to get $\\dfrac{20 \\times 19}{2!} = 190$ ways to draw two red balls.  So the total number of outcomes for both the red and the white balls is $4060 \\times 190 = \\boxed{771,\\!400}$."
