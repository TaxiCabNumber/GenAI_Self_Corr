At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEach digit in the number 2001 is placed on a different card. In how many ways can three different cards be selected so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero?",
        "inference": "There are 4 different digits in the number 2001: 0, 1, and 2.\n\nIf we select three cards, there are 4 choices for the first card, 3 choices for the second card (since it cannot be the same as the first card), and 2 choices for the third card (since it cannot be the same as the first or second card). So there are a total of 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 ways to select three different cards from the number 2001.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the cases where the product of the numbers on the three cards is zero. This can only happen if one of the cards is 0.\n\nIf one of the cards is 0, there are 3 choices for the first card (since it cannot be 0), 3 choices for the second card (since it cannot be 0 or the same as the first card), and 1 choice for the third card (since it must be 0). So there are a total of 3 x 3 x 1 = 9 ways to select three different cards from the number 2001 such that one of the cards is 0.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to select three different cards from the number 2001 so that the product of the numbers on those cards is not zero is 24 - 9 = 15.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$15$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are four cards total, two of which have a zero on them. If three cards are selected, therefore, at least one of them must have a zero on it, making the product of the numbers on those three cards zero. Thus, there are $\\boxed{0}$ ways."
