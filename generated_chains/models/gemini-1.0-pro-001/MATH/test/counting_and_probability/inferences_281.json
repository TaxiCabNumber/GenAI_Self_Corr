At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur club has $25$ members, and wishes to pick a president, secretary, and treasurer. In how many ways can we choose the officers, if individual members are allowed to hold $2,$ but not all $3,$ offices?",
        "inference": "There are $25$ ways to choose the President.\nFor the Secretary, after the president is chosen, there are $24$ ways to choose the Secretary.\nFor the Treasurer, after the president and secretary are chosen, there are $23$ ways to choose the Treasurer.\nTherefore by the multiplication principle, the total number of ways is $25\\times24\\times23 = 13,800$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13800}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.\n\nIf the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\\times 25\\times 25-25=\\boxed{15,600}.$"
