At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA deli sandwich consists of one type of bread, one type of meat, and one type of sauce. The deli offers wheat, rye, and white bread; ham, turkey, roast beef, and tuna; ranch and southwest chipotle sauce. Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce. He tells the server to assemble a random deli sandwich. What is the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the number of ways Javier can order a sandwich that he is not allergic to.**\n\n* Javier is allergic to rye bread, tuna, and southwest chipotle sauce.\n* So he can choose wheat or white bread, turkey or ham, and ranch sauce.\n* Number of ways to choose bread: 2\n* Number of ways to choose meat: 2\n* Number of ways to choose sauce: 1\n* Total number of ways to order a sandwich that he is not allergic to: 2 * 2 * 1 = 4\n\n**Step 2: Find the total number of ways Javier can order a sandwich.**\n\n* He can choose wheat, rye, or white bread.\n* He can choose ham, turkey, roast beef, or tuna.\n* He can choose ranch or southwest chipotle sauce.\n* Total number of ways to order a sandwich: 3 * 4 * 2 = 24\n\n**Step 3: Find the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction.**\n\n* Probability = (Number of ways Javier can order a sandwich that he is allergic to) / (Total number of ways Javier can order a sandwich)\n* Probability = (24 - 4) / 24\n* Probability = 5/6\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5/6}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We find the probability that Javier does not suffer an allergic reaction, and subtract from 1. For Javier to not suffer an allergic reaction, the server must choose wheat or white bread; turkey, roast beef, or ham; and ranch sauce. The probability of this occurring is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability that Javier suffers an allergic reaction is $1-\\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$."
