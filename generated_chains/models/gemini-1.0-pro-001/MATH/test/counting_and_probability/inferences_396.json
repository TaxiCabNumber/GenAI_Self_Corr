At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a lottery, a ticket costs $\\$3$, and the jackpot is worth $\\$250000$. In all, $100000$ tickets are sold, one ticket is randomly drawn, and the winner is awarded the jackpot. What are the expected winnings in dollars of buying one ticket (including the cost of the ticket)?",
        "inference": "The probability of winning the jackpot is $\\frac{1}{100000}$. The expected winnings are the probability of winning times the amount of the winnings minus the cost of the ticket:\n$$E(W) = \\frac{1}{100000} \\times 250000 - 3 = \\frac{250000}{100000} - 3 = 2.5 - 3 = -0.5$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-0.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The chance of winning the jackpot is $\\frac{1}{100000}$. The value of the jackpot is $\\$250000$. The expected winnings, minus the cost of the ticket is $E = \\frac{1}{100000} \\cdot \\$250000 - \\$3 = \\$2.50-\\$3.00 = \\boxed{-\\$0.50}$."
