At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn integer is randomly chosen from the integers 1 through 100, inclusive. What is the probability that the chosen integer is a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 10 perfect squares less than or equal to 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. \nThere are 4 perfect cubes less than or equal to 100: 1, 8, 27, and 64. Two of these are perfect squares so there are 2 perfect cubes that are not perfect squares. Therefore, there are 10 + 2 - 2 = 10 perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both. Since there are 100 integers from 1 to 100, inclusive, the probability that the chosen integer is a perfect square or a perfect cube, but not both, is $\\frac{10}{100}=\\frac{1}{10}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\\frac{10}{100} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$."
