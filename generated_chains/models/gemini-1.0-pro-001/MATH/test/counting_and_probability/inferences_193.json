At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMikka wants to order a pizza with two different toppings. He has 8 different toppings to choose from. How many different pizzas could he order?",
        "inference": "There are 8 different toppings, so for the first topping there are 8 options. For the second topping, there are 7 options left since one topping is already chosen.\n\nSo, the number of different pizzas Mikka could order is 8 x 7 = 56.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{56.} I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 choices of toppings, and we need to choose 2 distinct toppings. This is represented by the number of 2-element subsets of an 8 -element set. We use the binomial coefficient ${8 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{28}$ to compute this."
