        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo jokers are added to a $52$ card deck and the entire stack of $54$ cards is shuffled randomly.  What is the expected number of cards that will be strictly between the two jokers?",
        "inference": "The two jokers divide the deck into three sections: the cards before the first joker, the cards between the two jokers, and the cards after the second joker.  The number of cards in the middle section is uniformly distributed between $0$ and $52$, inclusive.  Thus, the expected number of cards in the middle section is $\\frac{0+52}{2}=26$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each card has an equal likelihood of being either on top of the jokers, in between them, or below the jokers.  Thus, on average, $1/3$ of them will land between the two jokers. Multiplying this by the 52 yields our answer of $\\boxed{\\frac{52}{3}}$."
