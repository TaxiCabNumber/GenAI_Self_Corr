At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMary has $6$ identical basil plants, and three different window sills she can put them on. How many ways are there for Mary to put the plants on the window sills?",
        "inference": "First, there are $3$ ways to put the first plant on a window sill. There are $3$ ways to put the second plant, $3$ ways to put the third plant, and so on. So, the total number of ways to put all $6$ plants on the window sills is $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 3^6$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{729}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.\n\nIf all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.\n\nIf $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.\n\nIf $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.\n\nIf $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.\n\nIn total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.\n\nSee if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills."
