At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHarold tosses a nickel four times.  What is the probability that he gets at least as many heads as tails?",
        "inference": "When a coin is tossed four times, there are 24 possible outcomes. These outcomes can be represented by a tree diagram.\n\nThe probability of getting at least as many heads as tails is the probability of getting 2 heads and 2 tails, 3 heads and 1 tail, or 4 heads and 0 tails.\n\nThe probability of getting 2 heads and 2 tails is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nThe probability of getting 3 heads and 1 tail is 4/24 = 1/6.\n\nThe probability of getting 4 heads and 0 tails is 1/24.\n\nSo, the probability of getting at least as many heads as tails is 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/24 = 11/24 = 0.4583.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0.4583}. I hope it is correct.",
