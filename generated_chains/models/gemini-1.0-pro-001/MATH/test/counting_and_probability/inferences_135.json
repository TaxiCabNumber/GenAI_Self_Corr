At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the rectangular region with the following points as vertices: $$(5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4).$$ How many points with integer coordinates will be strictly in the interior of this rectangular region?",
        "inference": "The interior of the rectangular region consists of all points inside the rectangle but not on its boundary. The boundary of the rectangle consists of the four sides, each of which is parallel to one of the coordinate axes.\n\nThe x-coordinates of the points on the left and right sides of the rectangle are -5 and 5, respectively. The y-coordinates of the points on the top and bottom sides of the rectangle are 4 and -4, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the interior of the rectangular region consists of all points (x, y) such that:\n\n* -5 < x < 5\n* -4 < y < 4\n\nThere are 10 integers between -5 and 5 (inclusive), and there are 9 integers between -4 and 4 (inclusive). Therefore, there are 10 * 9 = 90 points with integer coordinates in the interior of the rectangular region.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{90}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The rectangular region is 10 units by 8 units, resulting in an 8 by 6 rectangular region in the interior, which forms a 9-by-7 array of lattice points. That's $\\boxed{63}$ points with integer coordinates, as shown in the figure. [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nadd(grid(10,8));\ndraw((1,1)--(9,1)--(9,7)--(1,7)--cycle,linewidth(1.2));\n[/asy] Note: We are counting points, not squares. It is a common mistake to count the interior squares, for 48, instead of interior lattice points, which gives the correct answer of 63."
