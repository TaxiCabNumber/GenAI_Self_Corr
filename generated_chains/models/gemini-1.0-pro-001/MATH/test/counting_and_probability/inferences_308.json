At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven 5 colors to choose from, how many ways can we color the four unit squares of a $2\\times 2$ board, given that two colorings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other? (Note that we can use the same color for more than one square.)\n[asy]\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((.5,0)--(.5,1));\ndraw((0,.5)--(1,.5));\n[/asy]",

There are $5$ choices for the uncolored square. Once the uncolored square is chosen, there are $5$ choices for each of the other $3$ squares.

If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color).
