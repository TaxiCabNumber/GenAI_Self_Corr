At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOne fair die has faces 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 and another has faces 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. The dice  are rolled and the numbers on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum will be odd?",
