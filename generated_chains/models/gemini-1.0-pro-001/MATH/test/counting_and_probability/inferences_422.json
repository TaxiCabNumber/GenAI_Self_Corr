At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA group of 10 Caltech students go to Lake Street for lunch. Each student eats at either Chipotle or Panda Express.  In how many different ways can the students collectively go to lunch?",
