At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive balls are numbered with the integers 1 through 5 and placed in a jar. Three are drawn without replacement. What is the probability that the sum of the three integers on the balls is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are $5 \\choose 3 = 10$ ways to choose three balls from five.\n\nThe sum of three integers is odd if and only if an odd number of integers are odd.\n\nThere are three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and two even numbers (2, 4).\n\nThere are $3 \\choose 1 \\cdot 2 \\choose 2 = 3$ ways to choose one odd number and two even numbers.\n\nThere are $3 \\choose 2 \\cdot 2 \\choose 1 = 3$ ways to choose two odd numbers and one even number.\n\nThere are $3 \\choose 3 = 1$ way to choose three odd numbers.\n\nSo there are $3 + 3 + 1 = 7$ ways to choose three balls such that the sum of the integers on the balls is odd.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the three integers on the balls is odd is $\\frac{7}{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.

        "ground_truth": "The sum of the three integers on the drawn balls is 15 minus the sum of the integers on the two balls that were left behind.  Therefore, we are looking for the probability that the two balls that were left behind sum to an even number.  There are $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose these two balls.  Their sum is even only if they are both even or both odd.  The probability they are both even is $\\frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that they are both odd is $\\frac{3}{10}$.  In total, the probability that their sum is even is $\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{3}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
