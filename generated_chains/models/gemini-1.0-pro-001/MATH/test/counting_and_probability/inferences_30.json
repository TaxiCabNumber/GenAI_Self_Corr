        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf two distinct members of the set $\\{ 2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98 \\}$ are randomly selected and multiplied, what is the probability that the product is a multiple of 196? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The only pairs of numbers whose product is a multiple of 196 is 14 and 14.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 numbers from the set is $^7C_2 = 21$.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\frac{1}{21}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{21}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since a multiple of 196 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 7, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 7. For one thing, 98 can be paired with any even number as it has 1 factor of 2, since $98=2 \\cdot 7^2$ takes care of all the other primes. So, 98 can be paired with 2, 4, 12, 14, and 28, for 5 pairs. Then, 28 can be paired with (excluding 98 which we already counted) 21 and 14, both of which have the necessary factor of 7, giving us 2 more pairs. There are no remaining pairs of numbers 21 and smaller that are multiples of 196, because the only pair with two factors of 7, $\\{14, 21 \\}$, has a factor of 2 but not 4. So, there are $5+2=7$ pairs. And in total, there are ${7 \\choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\\frac{7}{21} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
