In general, the $n$th row of Pascal's triangle starts with 1, ends with 1, and has middle numbers of the form $C(n, k)$, where $C(n, k)$ is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\nSo, the ninth number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts 1, 11 is $C(10, 8) = 45$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$.
