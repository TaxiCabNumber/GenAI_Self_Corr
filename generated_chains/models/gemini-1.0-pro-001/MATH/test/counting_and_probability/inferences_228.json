I hope it is correct.'\nAn unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac35$, on tails with probability $\\frac15$, and on its edge with probability $\\frac15$.  If it comes up heads, I win 4 dollars.  If it comes up tails, I lose 1 dollar.  But if it lands on its edge, I lose 10 dollars.  What is the expected winnings from one flip?
