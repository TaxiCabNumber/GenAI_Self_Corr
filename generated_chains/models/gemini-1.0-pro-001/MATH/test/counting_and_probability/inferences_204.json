At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA drawer contains 3 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
        "inference": "There are 9 balls in the drawer. 2 of the 9 are white. So, the probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw is 2/9. After the first white ball is drawn, there are 8 balls left in the drawer, and 1 of the 8 is white. So, the probability of drawing a white ball on the second draw is 1/8. The probability of drawing two white balls is the product of the probabilities of drawing a white ball on the first draw and a white ball on the second draw:\n\n$$P(\\text{white, white}) = P(\\text{white}) \\times P(\\text{white}|\\text{white}) = \\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{36}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{36}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{3}{36} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}}$."
