At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cook has 10 red peppers and 5 green peppers. If the cook selects 6 peppers at random, what is the probability that he selects at least 4 green peppers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are $\\binom{10 + 5}{6} = \\binom{15}{6} = 5005$ ways to select 6 peppers out of the 15 peppers.\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways to select 4 green peppers out of the 5 green peppers.\n\nThere are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to select 2 red peppers out of the 10 red peppers.\n\nTo select at least 4 green peppers, the cook can select either 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers, or 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper, or 6 green peppers and 0 red peppers.\n\nThe number of ways to select at least 4 green peppers is $5 \\cdot 45 + 1 \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 226$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers is $\\frac{226}{5005} = \\frac{113}{2502}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{113}{2502}}$.

        "ground_truth": "We can count the number of ways to choose a group of 4 green and 2 red peppers and the number of ways to choose 5 green and 1 red peppers. These are $\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{10}{2}=5\\cdot45=225$ and $\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{10}{1}=10$. The total number of ways the cook can choose peppers is $\\binom{15}{6}=5005$. Therefore, the probability that out of six randomly chosen peppers at least four will be green is $\\frac{235}{5005}=\\boxed{\\frac{47}{1001}}$."
