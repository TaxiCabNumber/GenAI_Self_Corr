At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI coach a soccer team with 15 members.  I want to choose a starting lineup consisting of 11 players, two of whom will represent the team in the captains meeting at the beginning of the game.  In how many ways can I choose my starting lineup, including designating the two captains?",
        "inference": "- First, the team needs to choose the 11 out of 15 players to be in the lineup.  This can be done in $$C(15,11) = \\frac{15!}{11!4!} = 1365$$ ways.  Once the lineup has been chosen, the team must choose the two captains.  This can be done in $$C(11,2) = \\frac{11!}{9!2!} = 55$$  ways.  Therefore, the team can choose a starting lineup including designating the two captains in $$1365 \\cdot 55 = \\boxed{75075}$$  ways.\nFinal Answer: $\\\\boxed{75075}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{15}{2}=105$ ways to select the 2 captains from among the 15 players on the team. We then need to choose the remaining 9 starters from among the remaining 13 players, which can be done in $\\binom{13}{9}=715$ ways. This gives us a total of $\\binom{15}{2}\\cdot\\binom{13}{9}=105\\cdot715=\\boxed{75,\\!075}$ ways."
