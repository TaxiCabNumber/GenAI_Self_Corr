At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 6 people at a round table if John and Sam insist on sitting next to each other? (Two seatings are equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "1. We can consider John and Sam as one unit, so we have 5 units to arrange.\n2. There are 5! ways to arrange these units.\n3. For each of these arrangements, there are 2 ways to arrange John and Sam within their unit.\n4. Therefore, the total number of ways is 5! * 2 = 240.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{240}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To take care of rotations, we can fix John at the topmost seat.  We then have two choices for Sam: either side of John. The other four may sit anywhere in the other four seats. Thus there are $2\\times 4! = \\boxed{48}$ ways."
