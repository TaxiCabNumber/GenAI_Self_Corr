At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag contains 12 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. Two marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and one is blue? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "There are 18 marbles total. The probability of selecting a red marble first is 12 / 18 = 2 / 3. After selecting a red marble, there are 11 red marbles and 6 blue marbles left in the bag, for a total of 17 marbles. The probability of selecting a blue marble second is 6 / 17.\n\nThe probability of selecting one red marble and one blue marble is the probability of selecting a red marble first and then a blue marble second, or the probability of selecting a blue marble first and then a red marble second.\n\nProbability = (2 / 3) * (6 / 17) + (1 / 3) * (12 / 17)\nProbability = (12 / 51) + (12 / 51)\nProbability = 24 / 51\n**Final Answer: $\\frac{24}{51}$**",
        "ground_truth": "If a red marble is chosen first ($\\frac{12}{18}=\\frac{2}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{6}{17}$ chance that a blue marble will be chosen second. If a blue marble is chosen first ($\\frac{6}{18}=\\frac{1}{3}$ chance), then there is a $\\frac{12}{17}$ chance that a red marble will be chosen second.
