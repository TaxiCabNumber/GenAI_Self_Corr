At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBeginning at point $A$ in the diagram below, Dora selects one of the four possible directions with equal probability. Each time she comes to an intersection, she again randomly selects one of the possible directions. What is the probability that, in her first four steps, she will walk completely around the gray square? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        "inference": "Step 1: Dora can take 4 different directions from A.\n\nStep 2: If she goes right or down, she has no chance to walk around the gray square, so we just consider the cases when she goes up or left.\n\nStep 3: If she goes up, she has 3 different directions to go. Only one of them leads to walking around the gray square.\n\nStep 4: If she goes left, she has 4 different directions to go. Only two of them lead to walking around the gray square.\n\nStep 5: The probability of Dora walking around the gray square in the first four steps is\n$$\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\times\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{4}\\times\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{36}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{5}{72}=\\frac{5}{72}.$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{5}{72}$}.

        "ground_truth": "The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{256}$.  Therefore, the probability that she ends up where she started is $\\dfrac{1}{256}+\\dfrac{1}{256}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{128}}$."
