At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob plays a game where, for some number $n$, he chooses a random integer between 0 and $n-1$, inclusive. If Bob plays this game for each of the first four prime numbers, what is the probability that the sum of the numbers he gets is greater than 0?",
        "inference": "Bob has four choices for $n$: 2, 3, 5, and 7. In each game, if he chooses $0$, the sum is less than or equal to 0. If he chooses any other integer, the sum is greater than 0. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum greater than 0 in each game is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of getting a sum greater than 0 in all four games is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4=\\frac{1}{16}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{16}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first four primes are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The only way for the sum of the numbers Bob gets to not be greater than 0 is if he gets a 0 each time he plays the game. The chance that Bob will get a 0 each time he plays is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{1}{210}$. Therefore, the probability that Bob will not get all 0's is $1-\\frac{1}{210}=\\boxed{\\frac{209}{210}}$."
