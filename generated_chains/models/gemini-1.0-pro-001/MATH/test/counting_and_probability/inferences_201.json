At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have a spinner that lands on 1 with a probability of $\\frac{1}{10}$, 2 with a probability of $\\frac{2}{10}$, 3 with a probability of $\\frac{3}{10}$, and 4 with a probability of $\\frac{4}{10}$. If Phil and Sarah both spin the spinner, what is the probability that they get the same number?",
        "inference": "The probability that Phil gets 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}$, and the probability that Sarah gets 1 is also $\\frac{1}{10}$. The probability that they both get 1 is $\\frac{1}{10}\\cdot\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{1}{100}$.\n\nThe probability that Phil gets 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}$, and the probability that Sarah gets 2 is also $\\frac{2}{10}$. The probability that they both get 2 is $\\frac{2}{10}\\cdot\\frac{2}{10}=\\frac{4}{100}$.\n\nThe probability that Phil gets 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}$, and the probability that Sarah gets 3 is also $\\frac{3}{10}$. The probability that they both get 3 is $\\frac{3}{10}\\cdot\\frac{3}{10}=\\frac{9}{100}$.\n\nThe probability that Phil gets 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}$, and the probability that Sarah gets 4 is also $\\frac{4}{10}$. The probability that they both get 4 is $\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{16}{100}$.\n\nThe probability that they get the same number is the sum of the probabilities that they both get 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the probability that they get the same number is $\\frac{1}{100}+\\frac{4}{100}+\\frac{9}{100}+\\frac{16}{100}=\\frac{30}{100}=\\frac{3}{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.

There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{10}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{100}$.
