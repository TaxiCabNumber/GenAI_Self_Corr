At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA mathematical prodigy wishes to put 2 of his indistinguishable IMO gold medals and 2 of his indistinguishable IPhO gold medals in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?",
        "inference": "There are 2! ways to arrange the IMO medals and 2! ways to arrange the IPhO medals. Since the medals are indistinguishable, we must divide by 2! to avoid overcounting. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is:\n\n$$2! \\cdot 2! / 2! = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
