At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to assign each of 6 friends to either the chemistry class or the biology class if one of these six, Manoj, refuses to be in a class without any of his friends?",
        "inference": "Since Manoj must be in a class with at least one of his friends, we will assume that there is one class with Manoj and at least one friend and one class with the remaining five friends. \n\nThere are 5 friends who can join Manoj in his class.  For each of these, there are two choices: join Manoj's class or the other class.  Thus, for the class with Manoj, there are \\(2^5 = 32\\) choices.  For the other class, there is only one choice since all five remaining students must be in that class.\n\nThus, the total number of ways to assign the friends to the two classes is \\(32\\).\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$32$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For each friend, there are 2 choices for which class to place them in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 6 friends, we multiply the number of choices together. Hence there are $2^6 = 64$ ways to split the friends into two classes. However, 2 of those 64 arrangements are invalid: we can't put Manoj in chemistry and everyone else in biology, and we can't put Manoj in biology and everyone else in chemistry. So our final answer is $64-2=\\boxed{62}$."
