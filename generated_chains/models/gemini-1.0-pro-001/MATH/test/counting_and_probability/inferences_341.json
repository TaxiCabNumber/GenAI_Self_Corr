At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA 12-slice pizza was made with only pepperoni and mushroom toppings, and every slice has at least one topping. Only five slices have pepperoni, and exactly eight slices have mushrooms. How many slices have both pepperoni and mushrooms?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nLet's represent the slices with pepperoni as \"P\" and the slices with mushrooms as \"M\".\n\nWe know that there are 12 slices in total: P + M = 12.\n\nWe also know that 5 slices have pepperoni: P = 5.\n\nAnd 8 slices have mushrooms: M = 8.\n\nTo find the number of slices with both pepperoni and mushrooms, we need to subtract the number of slices with only pepperoni and the number of slices with only mushrooms from the total number of slices:\n\n(P + M) - P - M = 12 - 5 - 8 = -1.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\\boxed{1}$."
