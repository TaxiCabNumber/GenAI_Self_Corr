At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDuring a party, a total of 78 handshakes occurred. If each person shook hands once with each of the other people, how many people were at the party?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of people at the party.\n\nEach person shook hands with x-1 other people.\n\nSince there were 78 handshakes in total, we have the equation:\n\nx-1 * x / 2 = 78\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx^2 - x - 156 = 0\n\n(x-13)(x+12) = 0\n\nx = 13 or x = -12\n\nSince the number of people at a party cannot be negative, we have:\n\nx = 13\n\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$13$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \\choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \\cdot 78 = 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 13 = 12 \\cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\\boxed{13}$ people at the party."
