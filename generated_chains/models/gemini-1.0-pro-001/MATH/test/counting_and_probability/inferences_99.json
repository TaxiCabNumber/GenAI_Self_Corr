In how many ways can they be seated in a row of 7 chairs such that all 3 girls sit next to each other?",
        "inference": "The number of ways the boys can be seated is 4! = 24.\nThe number of ways the girls can be seated is 3! = 6.\nThe number of ways the boys and girls can be seated together is 24 * 6 = 144.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{144}. I hope it is correct.**",

Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.\n\nTherefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \\times 4! \\times 3! = \\boxed{720}$."
