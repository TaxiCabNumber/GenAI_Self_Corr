At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $S$ be the set of points $(a,b)$ in the coordinate plane, where each of $a$ and $b$ may be $-1$, 0, or 1. How many distinct lines pass through at least two members of $S$?",
        "inference": "Since there are three choices for $a$ and three choices for $b$, there are $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ points in $S$.\n\nFor each point $(a_1, b_1)$ in $S$, there are two choices for the slope of a line passing through $(a_1, b_1)$ and another point in $S$. (The slope is either $\\frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_2 - a_1}$ or $\\frac{b_2 - b_1}{a_1 - a_2}$.)\n\nTherefore, there are $2 \\cdot 9 = 18$ lines passing through at least two points in $S$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{18}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{9}{2}=36$ pairs of points in $S$, and each pair determines a line. However, there are three horizontal, three vertical, and two diagonal lines that pass through three points of $S$, and these lines are each determined by three different pairs of points in $S$. Thus the number of distinct lines is $36 - 2 \\cdot 8= \\boxed{20}$."
