I hope it is correct.'\nHow many of the natural numbers from $1$ to $800,$ inclusive, contain the digit $6$ at least twice? (The numbers $266$ and $663$ are two natural numbers that contain the digit $6$ at least twice, but $430$ or $16$ are not.)",

That's a total of 200 numbers.\n190 of the numbers from 1 to 800 are 2-digit numbers that contain 6 at least once.\n100 of the numbers from 1 to 800 are 3-digit numbers that contain 6 at least once but not in the hundreds place.\n10 of the numbers from 1 to 800 are 4-digit numbers that contain 6 at least once but not in the hundreds or tens place.\n1 of the numbers from 1 to 800 is a 5-digit number that contains 6 at least once but not in the hundreds, tens, thousands, or ten thousands place.\n\nSo the total number of numbers from 1 to 800 that contain the digit 6 at least twice is:\n\n200 + 190 + 100 + 10 + 1 = 501\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$501$}.

(Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)\n\nAdding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times.
