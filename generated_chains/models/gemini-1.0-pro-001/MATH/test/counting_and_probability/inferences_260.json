        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo different positive integers less than 100 are randomly chosen and multiplied together. What is the probability that the resulting product is a multiple of 3?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of possible pairs of integers.  Since both integers are less than 100, there are 99 possible choices for the first integer and 99 possible choices for the second integer. Therefore, the total number of possible pairs is 99 * 99 = 9801.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of pairs that result in a product that is a multiple of 3, First, find the number of integers less than 100 that are multiples of 3. There are 33 such integers: 3, 6, 9, ..., 96, 99. For each of these integers, there are 33 possible choices for the other integer. Therefore, there are 33 * 33 = 1089 pairs that result in a product that is a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the probability that the resulting product is a multiple of 3.  The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 1089, and the total number of possible outcomes is 9801. Therefore, the probability that the resulting product is a multiple of 3 is 1089 / 9801 = 1/9.\n\n**Final Answer:  $\\\\boxed{1/9}.$ I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can choose two numbers in $\\binom{99}{2}=4851$ ways. Two numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 3 if at least one of them is a multiple of 3. We can more easily count the number of ways for the product to not be a multiple of 3: this happens when neither of the numbers is a multiple of 3. There are $\\frac{99}{3}=33$ multiples of 3 less than 100, and $99-33=66$ numbers which aren't multiples of 3. The number of ways to choose two of these numbers is $\\binom{66}{2}=2145$, so the number of way to choose two numbers where at least one is a multiple of 3 is $4851-2145=2706$. The final probability is $\\frac{2706}{4851}=\\boxed{\\frac{82}{147}}$."
