At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe letters $A, B$ and $C$ are used to form every possible three letter ``word.'' When these ``words'' are arranged in alphabetical order and numbered so that $AAA$ is Word 1 and $CCC$ is Word 27, what number will correspond to the position of word $BAB$ on the list?",
        "inference": "The number of ways to arrange $3$ objects is $3!=6$. Therefore, there are $6$ words with one letter repeated three times: $AAA, BBB, CCC, AAA, BBB, CCC$.\n\nThere are $3\\cdot5=15$ words with two letters the same: $AAB, AAC, AAB, AAC, ABA, ACA, BAA, BCA, CAA, CAB$.\n\nThere is only $1$ word with three different letters: $ABC$.\n\nSo, $1+6+15=22$ words precede $BAB$ on the list.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$22$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 9 possible words that start with A to begin the list, so the first word starting with B, BAA, is the 10th word. BAB is the next word after BAA, or word number $\\boxed{11}$."
