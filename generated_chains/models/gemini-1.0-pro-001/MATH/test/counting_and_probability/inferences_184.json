At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a class of 28 students, the teacher selects four people at random to participate in a geography contest. What is the probability that this group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students in the class? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

Probability of selecting at least two of the top geography students: 1 - Probability of selecting none of the top geography students\n3. Probability of selecting none of the top geography students: 25/28 * 24/27 * 23/26 * 22/25 = 2187/18564\n4. Probability of selecting at least two of the top geography students: 1 - 2187/18564 = 16697/18564\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{16697/18564}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We count the number of ways to choose a group of four students including at least two of the top three geography students.  This is just  $\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot \\binom{25}{2} + \\binom{3}{3}\\cdot\\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.  In all, there are $\\binom{28}{4} = 20475$ groups of four students.  Thus our desired probability is $\\frac{925}{20475} = \\boxed{\\frac{37}{819}}$."
