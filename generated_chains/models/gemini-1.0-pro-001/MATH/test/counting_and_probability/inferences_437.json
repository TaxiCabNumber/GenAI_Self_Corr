At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA nursery employee wishes to plant 2 identical Golden Delicious apple trees and 5 identical Bartlett pear trees in one row. How many distinct arrangements are possible?",
        "inference": "The number of distinct arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose (without replacement) the 2 positions in the row for the Golden Delicious apple trees from the 7 available positions, multiplied by the number of ways to order the 2 Golden Delicious apple trees and the 5 Bartlett pear trees, i.e., (No. of ways to choose 2 positions for Golden Delicious trees) * (No. of arrangements with the 7 trees in those 7 positions).\n\n(No. of ways to choose 2 positions for Golden Delicious trees) = $_7C_2$ = 21\n\n(No. of arrangements with the 7 trees in those 7 positions) = 7! = 5040\n\nSo, the number of distinct arrangements is 21 * 5040 = 105840.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{105840}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have 7 places to plant trees in our row.  We can choose two of these to be Golden Delicious in $\\binom{7}{2}= \\boxed{21}$ ways.  For each of these choices, we plant the Bartlett pears in the remaining 5 places."
