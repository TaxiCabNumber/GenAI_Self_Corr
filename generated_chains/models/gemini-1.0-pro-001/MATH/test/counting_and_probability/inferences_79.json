At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Coventry School's European debate club has 6 German delegates, 5 French delegates, and 3 Italian delegates.  In how many ways can these 14 delegates sit in a row of 14 chairs, if each country's delegates insist on all sitting next to each other?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe German delegates can be arranged in 6! ways.\n\nThe French delegates can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\nThe Italian delegates can be arranged in 3! ways.\n\nSo the total number of ways the delegates can be arranged is 6! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 3! = 12,960.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12960}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We first think of the German delegates forming a single German block, denoted G, the French delegates forming a single French block F, and the Italian delegates forming a single Italian block I.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large FGI, FIG, GFI, GIF, IFG, IGF.}} $$ Within each block, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the German delegates, $5!$ ways to arrange the French delegates, and $3!$ ways to arrange the Italian delegates.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 6! \\times 5! \\times 3! = 6 \\times 720 \\times 120 \\times 6 = \\boxed{3,\\!110,\\!400} $$ ways to seat all 14 delegates."
