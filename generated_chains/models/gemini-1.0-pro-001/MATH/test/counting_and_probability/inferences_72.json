        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a three-digit number, the hundreds digit is greater than 5, the tens digit is greater than 4 but less than 8, and the units digit is the smallest prime number. How many three-digit numbers satisfy all of these conditions?",
        "inference": "1. The hundreds digit is greater than 5, so it can be 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n2. The tens digit is greater than 4 but less than 8, so it can be 5, 6, or 7.\n3. The units digit is the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\nSo, we have 4 choices for the hundreds digit, 3 choices for the tens digit, and 1 choice for the units digit.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-digit numbers that satisfy all of these conditions is $4 \\times 3 \\times 1 = \\boxed{12}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have four choices for the hundreds digit, three choices for the tens digit, and only one choice for the units digit.  Thus we have a total of $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{12}$ possible numbers."
