At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bag has 4 red and 6 blue marbles.  A marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected.  What is the probability that both are the same color?",
        "inference": "The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10, and the probability of selecting a blue marble on the second draw is 6/9. The probability of selecting two red marbles is (4/10) * (3/9) = 2/15. The probability of selecting two blue marbles is (6/10) * (5/9) = 1/3. The probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 2/15 + 1/3 = 11/15.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11/15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\\text{both red}) = P(\\text{1st red}) \\times P(\\text{2nd red \\textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both red}) = \\frac{4}{10}\\times \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = P(\\text{1st blue}) \\times P(\\text{2nd blue \\textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\\text{both blue}) = \\frac{6}{10}\\times \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.
