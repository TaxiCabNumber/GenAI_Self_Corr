        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA large, regular hexagon is drawn on the ground, and a man stands at one of the vertices.  The man flips a coin.  If the coin lands heads, he walks counterclockwise along the edge of the hexagon until reaching the next nearest vertex.  If the coin lands tails, he walks clockwise around the hexagon until reaching another vertex.  Once there, he repeats the process.  The man flips the coin a total of six times.  What is the probability that the man is standing where he started when he is finished?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nAfter the first flip, the man either moves one vertex counterclockwise or one vertex clockwise.  After the second flip, he is either two vertices clockwise or two vertices counterclockwise from where he started.  Thus, after two flips, he is either back where he started or three vertices away.  Similarly, after four flips, he is either back where he started, three vertices away, or five vertices away.  After six flips, he is either back where he started, three vertices away, five vertices away, or he has made a complete circuit of the hexagon and is two vertices away from where he started.  Thus, there are four possibilities for his final position, and only one of them is where he started.  Therefore, the probability that he is standing where he started when he is finished is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{4}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are a total of $2^6=64$ equally likely sequences of heads and tails coin flips.  Each toss corresponds to a movement clockwise or counterclockwise, so each sequence of coin tosses corresponds to a sequence of six movements, $L$ or $R$.  If the man gets six consecutive heads or tails, corresponding to $RRRRRR$ or $LLLLLL$, then he will return to the starting point.  But, the man could also flip three heads and three tails in some order, corresponding to a sequence like $RRLRLL$.  There are a total of $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ sequences of moves that include three moves counterclockwise, and three clockwise.  The probability that the man ends up where he started is: $$\\frac{20+1+1}{64}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{32}}$$"
