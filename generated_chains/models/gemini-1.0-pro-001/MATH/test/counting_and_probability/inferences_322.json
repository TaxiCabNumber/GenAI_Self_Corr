        "inference": "From $C$ to $B$ there are two possible moves: up and to the right. Thus, we can get to $C$ from $B$ by making a sequence of $w-2$ moves to the right and $h-3$ moves up. Therefore, the number of paths is equal to the number of ways to permute a sequence of $w-2$ Rs and $h-3$ Us. The number of permutations of n different objects is n!. So, the final answer is $(w-2)!(h-3)!$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(w-2)!(h-3)!}$. I hope it is correct.",
