At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books. In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math books to be next to each other?",
        "inference": "First, we need to subtract the number of ways in which the math books are next to each other.\n\nThere are $4 !$ ways to arrange the non-math books, and $2!$ ways to arrange the math books. However, we need to divide by $2!$ to account for the fact that the math books are indistinguishable. Therefore, there are $4!\\cdot2!/2!=48$ ways to arrange the math books next to each other.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the books such that the math books are not next to each other. This is simply the total number of ways to arrange the books minus the number of ways in which the math books are next to each other.\n\nThere are $6!$ ways to arrange the books in total.

There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.\n\nSo the total number of ways the books can be placed is $4\\times3\\times2\\times1\\times5\\times 4 =\\boxed{480}.$"
