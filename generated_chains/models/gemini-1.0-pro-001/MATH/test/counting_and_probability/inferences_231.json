At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many prime numbers have squares between 100 and 300?",
        "inference": "The square of 10 is between 100 and 300, so 10 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nThe square of 11 is between 100 and 300, so 11 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nThe square of 13 is between 100 and 300, so 13 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nThe square of 17 is between 100 and 300, so 17 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nThe square of 19 is between 100 and 300, so 19 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nThe square of 23 is between 100 and 300, so 23 is a prime number that has a square between 100 and 300.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $10^2 =100$, $17^2 = 289$, and $18^2=324$, we know that the integers whose squares are between 100 and 300 are the integers between 10 and 18.  Between 10 and 18, 3 primes exist: 11, 13, 17, thus the answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
