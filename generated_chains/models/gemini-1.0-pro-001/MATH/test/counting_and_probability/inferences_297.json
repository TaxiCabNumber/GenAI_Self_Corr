I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are dealt at random from a standard deck (13 clubs, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts, and 13 spades) of 52 cards.  What is the probability that all three cards are $\\heartsuit$s?",

        "ground_truth": "The probability is $\\dfrac{13}{52} \\times \\dfrac{12}{51} \\times \\dfrac{11}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{850}}$."
