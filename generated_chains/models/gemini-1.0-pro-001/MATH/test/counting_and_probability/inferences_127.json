At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the total number of possible outcomes when two dice are rolled.  Each die has 6 possible outcomes, so there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes when two dice are rolled.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the number of outcomes where the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive.  For a sum of 3, there is 1 outcome:  (1, 2).  For a sum of 4, there are 2 outcomes:  (1, 3) and (2, 2).  For a sum of 5, there are 3 outcomes:  (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2).  For a sum of 6, there are 4 outcomes:  (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2).  For a sum of 7, there are 5 outcomes:  (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (5, 2).  For a sum of 8, there are 4 outcomes:  (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3).  For a sum of 9, there are 3 outcomes:  (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4).  For a sum of 10, there are 2 outcomes:  (4, 6) and (5, 5).  For a sum of 11, there is 1 outcome:  (5, 6). So, there are a total of 25 outcomes where the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is between 3 and 11, inclusive.  The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability is 25 / 36 = 5 / 7.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}$, or $\\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\\frac{1}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{18}}$."
