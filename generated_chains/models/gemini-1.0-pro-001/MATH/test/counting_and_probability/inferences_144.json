        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4?",
        "inference": "For the first three digits, there are $6$ choices for each digit: $5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0$. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ choices for the first three digits.\n\nFor the last two digits, there are $10$ choices for each digit: $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$. Therefore, there are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ choices for the last two digits.\n\nSo, there are $216 \\times 100 = \\boxed{21600}$ five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21600}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are five digits greater than $4$ (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and each of the first three zip code digits could be any of them. Hence, there are $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5 = 125$ ways to choose the first three digits. The last two zip code digits have no restrictions, so there are $10 \\cdot 10 = 100$ ways to choose them. Thus, there are $125 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{12500}$ such zip codes."
