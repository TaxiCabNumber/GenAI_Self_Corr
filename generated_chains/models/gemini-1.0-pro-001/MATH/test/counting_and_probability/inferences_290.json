        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA palindrome is a number which reads the same forward as backward. How many five-digit palindromes can be made from the digits 1, 2, and 9?  (Each digit may be used more than once.)",
        "inference": "- There are 2 choices for each of the 2 center digits.\n- There are 2 choices for each of the 2 outside digits.\n- There is 1 choice for the middle digit.\n- So, the number of 5-digit palindromes = 2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 8.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A five-digit palindrome would be of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits (not necessarily distinct) from $0$ to $9$ (with $A$ from $1$ to $9$). We have three possibilities for each of $A$, $B$ and $C,$ which gives us $3^3 = \\boxed{27}$ possible palindromes."
