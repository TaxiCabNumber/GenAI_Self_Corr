At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA target consists of four concentric circles with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches as shown. Given that a dart is thrown that hits the target at a random point, what is the probability that it hits a shaded region? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]size(100); import graph; fill(Circle((0,0),5),gray(.6));\n\nclip(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4),fillrule(1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2) ^^ Circle((0,0),3) ^^ Circle((0,0),4) ^^ Circle((0,0),5));[/asy]",
        "inference": "The area of the shaded regions is the area of the circle with radius 10 inches minus the area of the circle with radius 4 inches. The area of the circle with radius 10 inches is $10^2 \\pi=100\\pi$ square inches, and the area of the circle with radius 4 inches is $4^2 \\pi=16\\pi$ square inches. Therefore, the area of the shaded regions is $100\\pi-16\\pi=84\\pi$ square inches. The total area of the target is the area of the circle with radius 10 inches, which is $100\\pi$ square inches. Therefore, the probability that the dart hits a shaded region is $84\\pi/100\\pi=84/100=\\boxed{21/25}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{21/25}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The total area of the target is $\\pi\\cdot 10^2=100\\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\\pi\\cdot 4^2=16\\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\\pi \\cdot 8^2 - \\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 28\\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\\pi+28\\pi=44\\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\\frac{44\\pi}{100\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{25}}$."
