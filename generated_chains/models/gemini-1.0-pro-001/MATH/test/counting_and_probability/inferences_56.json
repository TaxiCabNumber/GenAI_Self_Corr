At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo fair, 6-sided dice are thrown.  What is the probability that the product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The product of the two numbers is a multiple of 5 only if both dice show either 1 or 5. There are 4 ways to get a 1 (out of 6 possibilities) and 1 way to get a 5 (out of 6 possibilities). Thus there are 4 * 1 = 4 ways to get a multiple of 5.\nAll other outcomes (36 - 4 = 32) do not give a multiple of 5.\nTherefore, the probability of getting a multiple of 5 is 4/40 = 1/10.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Probability questions are sometimes answered by calculating the ways the event will NOT happen, then subtracting.  In this problem the $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$ faces are paired to create $5 \\times 5 = 25$ number pairs whose product is NOT multiples of 5.  This leaves $36 - 25 = 11$ ways to get a multiple of $5$, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}$."
