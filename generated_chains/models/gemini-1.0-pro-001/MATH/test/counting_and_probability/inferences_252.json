I hope it is correct.'\nA 6-sided die is weighted so that the probability of any number being rolled is proportional to the value of the roll.  (So, for example, the probability of a 2 being rolled is twice that of a 1 being rolled.)  What is the expected value of a roll of this weighted die?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
