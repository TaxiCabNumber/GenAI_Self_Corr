At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can 5 different keys be placed on a keychain?  (Two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated or flipped to be identical to the other.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThere are 5 choices for the first key, 4 choices for the second key, 3 choices for the third key, 2 choices for the fourth key, and 1 choice for the last key.  Therefore, there are $5\\times 4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1=120$ ways to place the keys on the keychain.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{120}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $5!$ ways to place the keys on the keychain, but we must divide by 5 for rotational symmetry (5 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the keychain to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5 \\times 2} = \\boxed{12}$."
