At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBeth rolls a fair six-sided die. If she rolls a prime number, she wins 1 dollar, but if she rolls a composite number, she loses 1 dollar. If she rolls 1 nothing happens. What is the expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince the die is fair, the probability of rolling each number is $\\frac{1}{6}$.  \nIf Beth rolls a prime number, she wins $1.  \nThe prime numbers on a six-sided die are $2, 3, and 5$.  \nSo the probability of rolling a prime number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.  \nThe expected value of winning for rolling a prime number is $1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nIf Beth rolls a composite number, she loses $1.  \nThe composite numbers on a six-sided die are $4$ and $6$.  \nSo the probability of rolling a composite number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.  \nThe expected value of losing for rolling a composite number is $-1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe expected value of the amount of money Beth will win if she rolls the die once is the sum of the expected values of winning and losing:\n$$EV = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.
