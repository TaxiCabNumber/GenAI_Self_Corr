At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to arrange $6$ beads of distinct colors in a $2 \\times 3$ grid if reflections and rotations are considered the same? (In other words, two arrangements are considered the same if I can rotate and/or reflect one arrangement to get the other.)",
        "inference": "First, choose two of the six beads to fill the top row. This can be done in $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways.\n\nFor the second row, the remaining four beads can be arranged in $4! = 24$ ways.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements is $15 \\times 24 = 360$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{360}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $6! = 720$ ways to put the beads on the grid ignoring distinguishability. On the other hand, there are $4$ possible transformations of the board using rotations and reflections (including the identity):\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nA & B & C & & C & B & A\\\\\nD & E & F & & F & E & D\n\\end{tabular}\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\nF & E & D & & D & E & F\\\\\nC & B & A & & A & B & C\n\\end{tabular}None of these transformations besides the identity fixes an arrangement, so each arrangement is equivalent to three others. As a result, there are $\\tfrac{720}{4} = \\boxed{180}$ different arrangements."
