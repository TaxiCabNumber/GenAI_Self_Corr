I hope it is correct.'\nFourteen white cubes are put together to form the figure on the right.  The complete surface of the figure, including the bottom, is painted red.  The figure is then separated into individual cubes.

        "inference": "First, one cube has 6 faces painted red.  Removing this cube leaves 13 cubes.  Each of the 13 cubes has two faces painted red.  Thus, a total of $13*2=26$ faces that are painted red.  Since there are 84 faces in total, subtracting the 26 faces that are painted red leaves $84-26=58$ faces that are not painted red.  Since each cube has 6 faces, this means that $58/6=9.67$ cubes have no red faces, which must be rounded down to $9$.  Since there are $14-1=13$ cubes that have some red faces, and $9$ of these have no red faces, this means that $13-9=4$ cubes have exactly four red faces.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "A cube has four red faces if it is attached to exactly two other cubes.  The four top cubes are each attached to only one other cube,  so they have five red faces.  The four bottom corner cubes are each attached to three others, so they have three red faces.  The remaining $\\boxed{6}$ each have four red faces."
