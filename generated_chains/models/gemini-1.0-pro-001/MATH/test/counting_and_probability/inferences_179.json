At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn an orchestra, $60\\%$ of the musicians play string instruments, and the remainder play woodwind, brass, or percussion instruments. If the orchestra has 130 members, how many musicians do not play string instruments?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe know that $60\\%$ of the orchestra plays string instruments. This means that $100\\% - 60\\% = 40\\%$ of the orchestra does not play string instruments. Therefore, the number of musicians who do not play string instruments is $40\\%\\cdot130=52$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{52}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know a person can either play a string instrument or not play a string instrument. $60\\% \\times 130 = 78$ musicians play string instruments, yielding $130-78 = \\boxed{52}$ musicians who do not play string instruments."
