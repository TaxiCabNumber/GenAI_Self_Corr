At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose 2 distinct integers are chosen from 1 through 9, inclusive.  What is the probability that they are both odd?",

Of these pairs, 5 are odd: (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (1,9), and (3,5).  Therefore, the probability that both integers are odd is 5/36 = 1/7.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1/7}$. I hope it is correct.**",

There are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose 2 numbers from our set of 9 if we don't care about order.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose 2 numbers from the 5 odd numbers without regard to order.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$."
