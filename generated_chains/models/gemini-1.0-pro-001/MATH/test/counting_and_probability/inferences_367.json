At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA singles tournament had six players. Each player played every other player only once, with no ties. If Helen won 4 games, Ines won 3 games, Janet won 2 games, Kendra won 2 games and Lara won 2 games, how many games did Monica win?",
        "inference": "Helen won 4 games and played 5 games. So, she lost 1 game.\nInes won 3 games and played 5 games. So, she lost 2 games.\nJanet won 2 games and played 5 games. So, she lost 3 games.\nKendra won 2 games and played 5 games. So, she lost 3 games.\nLara won 2 games and played 5 games. So, she lost 3 games.\nMonica played 5 games. If she won x games, then she lost (5 - x) games.\nThe total number of games lost by all 6 players is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + (5 - x) = 17 - x.\nThe total number of games played by all 6 players is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30.\nSo, 17 - x = 30, which gives x = 13.\nTherefore, Monica won 13 games.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Each of the six players played 5 games, and each game involved two players. So there were $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ games. Helen, Ines, Janet, Kendra and Lara won a total of $4+3+2+2+2=13$ games, so Monica won $15-13=\\boxed{2}$ games."
