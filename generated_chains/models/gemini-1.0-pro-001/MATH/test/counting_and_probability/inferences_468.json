At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA theater group has eight members, of which four are females. How many ways are there to assign the roles of a play that involve one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender?",
        "inference": "1. The female lead can be chosen in 4 ways.\n2. The male lead can be chosen in 4 ways.\n3. The three objects can be chosen in 8C3 = 56 ways.\n4. Therefore, the total number of ways to assign the roles is 4 * 4 * 56 = 896.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$896$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 4 ways to select the female lead and 4 ways to select the male lead. Afterwards, there are 6 members who can play the first inanimate object, 5 who can play the second, and 4 for the last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4\\times4\\times6\\times5\\times4 = \\boxed{1920\\text{ ways.}}$"
