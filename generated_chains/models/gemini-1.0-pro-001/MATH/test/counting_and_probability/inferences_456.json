I hope it is correct.'\nA Senate committee consists of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats, and 2 Independents.  A subcommittee of 3 members is randomly chosen.  What is the probability that the subcommittee consists of 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent?",
        "inference": "1. **Total number of possible subcommittees:** The total number of possible subcommittees is the number of ways to choose 3 members from a group of 13 members, which is  $$C(13,3) = \\frac{13!}{3!(13-3)!} = \\frac{13!}{3!10!} = \\frac{13\\times12\\times11\u00d7\\cancel{10!}}{(3!)\u00d7\\cancel{10!}} = 286$$\n\n2. **Number of subcommittees with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent:** The number of subcommittees with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is the product of the number of ways to choose 1 Republican, the number of ways to choose 1 Democrat, and the number of ways to choose 1 Independent:  $$5\u00d76\u00d72 = 60$$\n\n3. **Probability of choosing a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent:** The probablity of choosing a subcommittee with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent is the number of subcommittees with 1 Republican, 1 Democrat, and 1 Independent divided by the total number of possible subcommittees:  $$P = \\frac{60}{286} = 0.21$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$0.21$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 ways to choose a Republican, 6 ways to choose a Democrat, and 2 ways to choose an Independent for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 60$ different subcommittees of a Republican, Democrat, and Independent.   There are $\\binom{13}{3} = \\dfrac{13\\cdot12\\cdot 11}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1} = 286$ ways to choose 3 people from 13 to form a committee, so there are 286 possible committees.
