At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA fisherman can see seven aquatic creatures in a lake --- four crocodiles, a catfish, and two giant squid. If he does not wish to fish two crocodiles consecutively, in how many orders can he catch all seven creatures? (Individuals from the same species are indistinguishable.)",
        "inference": "The fisherman has 7 creatures to catch, and he does not want to fish two crocodiles consecutively.\n\nThere are 7 ways to choose the first creature.\n\nIf the first creature is a crocodile, there are 6 ways to choose the second creature (not a crocodile).\n\nIf the first creature is not a crocodile, there are 7 ways to choose the second creature.\n\nOnce the first two creatures have been chosen, there are 5 ways to choose the third creature.\n\nOnce the first three creatures have been chosen, there are 4 ways to choose the fourth creature.\n\nOnce the first four creatures have been chosen, there are 3 ways to choose the fifth creature.\n\nOnce the first five creatures have been chosen, there are 2 ways to choose the sixth creature.\n\nOnce the first six creatures have been chosen, there is only 1 way to choose the seventh creature.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040 ways to catch all seven creatures.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5040}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The crocodiles must be separated from each other by one of the other creatures, so he must catch them first, third, fifth, and seventh. For the second, fourth, and sixth slots, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the remaining three creatures.\n\nHowever, there are two giant squid, so we must divide by $2!$, the number of ways to arrange the squid.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3!}{2!}=\\boxed{3}$ ways."
