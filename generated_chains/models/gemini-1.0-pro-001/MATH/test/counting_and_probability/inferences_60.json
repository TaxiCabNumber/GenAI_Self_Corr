At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we choose 3 distinct letters of the alphabet, without regard to order, if we must choose 1 vowel (A, E, I, O, or U) and 2 consonants?",

(We divide by 2 because order does not matter.)\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the number of ways to choose 1 vowel by the number of ways to choose 2 consonants.\n5 * 210 = **1050**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$1050$}.
