At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOur basketball team has 10 players.  We need to divide into two teams of 5 for an intra-squad scrimmage.  In how many ways can we do this without restrictions?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Choose 5 players for the first team. This can be done in $\\binom{10}{5}=252$ ways.\n\n**Step 2:** The remaining 5 players automatically form the second team. Therefore, the total number of ways to divide the team into two teams of 5 without restrictions is $\\binom{10}{5}=252$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$252$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{10}{5} = 252$ ways to choose players for the first team, and the second team gets the remaining players.  However, since the teams are interchangeable, we must divide by two, so the answer is $252 / 2 = \\boxed{126}$."
