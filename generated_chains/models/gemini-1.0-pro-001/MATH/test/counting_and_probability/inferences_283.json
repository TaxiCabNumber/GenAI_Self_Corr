        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we form an international commission if we must choose one European country from among 6 European countries, one Asian country from among 4, one North American country from among 3, and one African country from among 7?",
        "inference": "For each of these options, we might have several choices. For example, there are 6 possible European countries that might be selected, so the first selection offers 6 choices. Similarly, there are 4 choices for Asian countries, 3 for North American countries, and 7 for African countries. Using the multiplication principle, we can form an international commission in $6\\times4\\times3\\times7 = 504$ ways.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{504}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are six ways in which one European country can be chosen, four in which one Asian country can be chosen, three in which one North American country can be chosen, and seven in which one African country can be chosen. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{504}$ ways to form the international commission."
