At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 18 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 8 white, 6 brown, and 4 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of white socks.\n\nThere are 8 white socks. To choose a pair, we need to select 2 socks out of 8. This can be done in 8C2 ways.\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of brown socks.\n\nThere are 6 brown socks. To choose a pair, we need to select 2 socks out of 6. This can be done in 6C2 ways.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the number of ways to choose a pair of blue socks.\n\nThere are 4 blue socks. To choose a pair, we need to select 2 socks out of 4. This can be done in 4C2 ways.\n\n**Step 4:** Add up the number of ways to choose a pair of socks of the same color.\n\nNumber of ways = 8C2 + 6C2 + 4C2\n= 28 + 15 + 6\n= 49\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$49$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  So the total number of choices for socks is $28 + 15 + 6 = \\boxed{49}$."
