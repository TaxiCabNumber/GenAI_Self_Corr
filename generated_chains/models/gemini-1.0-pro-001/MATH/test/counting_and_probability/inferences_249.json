At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn airline serves a dinner to all the passengers on an airplane. They get their choice of steak or fish. Three steak meals and three fish meals are set aside for the six-member crew. If the meals are distributed to the crew members randomly, what is the probability that both pilots get the fish?",
        "inference": "There are 6C2 ways to choose the 2 crew members who get the fish. There are 2 steak meals and 1 fish meal left for the remaining 4 crew members, so there are 3C2 ways to choose the 2 crew members who get the steak meals. Multiplying these two values together gives the total number of ways to distribute the meals, which is 6C2 * 3C2 = 15 * 3 = 45.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{15/45}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose 2 of the 6 meals for the pilots. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose 2 of the 3 fish meals. So the probability is $3/15 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$."
