        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer be chosen from a group of $4$ guys and $4$ girls and at least one girl and at least one guy holds at least one of those three positions? One person cannot serve in more than one position.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFirst, choose $1$ guy and $1$ girl to hold at least one of the three positions. \n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{1} \\binom{4}{1} = 16$ ways to do this. \n\nNow, there are $3$ positions to fill and $6$ people (the guy and girl chosen above, and the remaining $2$ guys and $3$ girls) to fill them. \n\nTherefore, there are $3! \\cdot 6 = 360$ ways to fill the positions. \n\nHowever, we have overcounted because we have included cases where neither a guy nor a girl holds at least one of the three positions. \n\nThere are $\\binom{4}{3} \\binom{4}{3} = 16$ ways to choose $3$ guys and $3$ girls to fill the positions. \n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to choose a President, Vice-President, and Treasurer with at least one girl and at least one guy holding at least one of those positions is $360 - 16 = \\boxed{344}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{344}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\\times7\\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\\times3\\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.\n\nThus, there are $336-48=\\boxed{288}$ good choices."
