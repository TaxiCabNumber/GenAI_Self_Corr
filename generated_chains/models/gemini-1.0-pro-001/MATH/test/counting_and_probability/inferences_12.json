At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that they are not all the same color?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the probability that all three cards are the same color.\n\nThere are 4 different colors in a standard deck of cards: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.  So, the probability of drawing a card of a specific color is 1/4.  If all three cards are the same color, then the probability of this happening is (1/4)^3 = 1/64.\n\n**Step 2:** Find the probability that the three cards are not all the same color.\n\nThe probability that the three cards are not all the same color is the complement of the probability that they are all the same color.  So, the probability that they are not all the same color is 1 - (1/64) = 63/64.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$63/64$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can find the probability they are all same color, then subtract that from 1. There are 26 cards of each color, so 3 of them can be selected in $\\binom{26}{3}$ ways, and of course there are 2 colors.  So the answer is \\[1-2\\frac{\\binom{26}{3}}{\\binom{52}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{17}}.\\]"
