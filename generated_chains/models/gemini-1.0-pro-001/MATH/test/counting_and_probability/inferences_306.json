She needs to buy three items: entree, drink, and dessert.\nStep 2: Let's list all the possible combinations of entree, drink, and dessert that cost less than $\\$7.50$.\nStep 3: The possible combinations are:\n- Pizza, Lemonade, Frozen Yogurt: $3.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00 (over her budget)\n- Pizza, Soda, Frozen Yogurt: $3.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $7.75 (over her budget)\n- Pizza, Lemonade, Cookies: $3.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $7.00 (within her budget)\n- Pizza, Soda, Cookies: $3.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $6.75 (within her budget)\n- Corn Dog, Lemonade, Frozen Yogurt: $2.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $7.00 (within her budget)\n- Corn Dog, Soda, Frozen Yogurt: $2.50 + $1.25 + $3.00 = $6.75 (within her budget)\n- Corn Dog, Lemonade, Cookies: $2.50 + $1.50 + $2.00 = $6.00 (within her budget)\n- Corn Dog, Soda, Cookies: $2.50 + $1.25 + $2.00 = $5.75 (within her budget)\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8}$.

        "ground_truth": "First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\\boxed{8\\text{ meals}}$ total."
