At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCamy made a list of every possible distinct five-digit positive integer that can be formed using each of the digits 1, 3, 4, 5 and 9 exactly once in each integer. What is the sum of the integers on Camy's list?",
        "inference": "First, we find the possible thousands digit. Since all digits must be used exactly once, the thousands digit must be either 1, 3, 4 or 5. There are four possibilities for the thousands digit.\n\nNext, we find the possible hundreds digit. Since the thousands digit has been chosen, there are three possibilities for the hundreds digit.\n\nSimilarly, since the thousands digit and hundreds digit have been chosen, there are two possibilities for the tens digit and one possibility for the units digit.\n\nTherefore, the number of 5-digit integers that can be formed is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.\n\nTo find the sum of the integers on Camy's list, we find the sum of a list of all integers from 10000 to 59432 in steps of 108. The formula for the sum of a list of integers in steps of d is n(n + 1)d/2, where n is the number of terms in the list.\n\nIn this case, n = 46, so the sum is 46 x 47 x 108 / 2 = 248508.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{248508}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Note that there are $4! = 24$ numbers ending in 1, since we have 4 choices for the 10s digit, 3 choices for the 100s digit, 2 choices for the 1000s digit, and 1 choice for the remaining digit.  Thus there are also 24 numbers ending in each of 3, 4, 5, 9, and the total contribution of ones digits to the sum is $24 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9) = 528$.  But we can make a similar argument about the contribution of the digits in the other places (10s, 100s, etc.), so our total sum is $528 + 5280 + \\ldots + 5280000 = 528 (1 + 10 + \\ldots + 10000) = 528\\cdot 11,111 = \\boxed{5,\\!866,\\!608}$."
