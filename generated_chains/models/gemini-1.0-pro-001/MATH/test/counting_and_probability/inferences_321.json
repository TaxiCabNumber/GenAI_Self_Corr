        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA player pays $\\$5$ to play a game. A six-sided die is rolled. If the number on the die is odd, the game is lost. If the number on the die is even, the die is rolled again. In this case the player wins some amount of money if the second number matches the first and loses otherwise. How much money should the player win if the game is fair? (In a fair game the probability of winning times the amount won is what the player should pay.)",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe probability of getting an odd number on the first roll is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of getting an even number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. If the first number is even, the probability of getting the same number on the second roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability of getting a different number is $\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nIf the player wins, they win $x$, the amount we are trying to find. If the player loses, they lose $\\$5$. So we can write the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot x+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot x = 5$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{1}{12}x = 5$$\n\n$$\\frac{6}{12}x+\\frac{1}{12}x = 5$$\n\n$$\\frac{7}{12}x = 5$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{5}{\\frac{7}{12}} = \\frac{5}{7}\\cdot12 = \\frac{60}{7}=8.57$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$8.57}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ represent the amount the player wins if the game is fair.  The chance of an even number is $1/2$, and the chance of matching this number on the second roll is $1/6$. So the probability of winning is $(1/2)(1/6)=1/12$. Therefore $(1/12)x=\\$5$ and $x=\\boxed{60}$."
