At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Roman alphabet (26 letters, A through Z).  Each word in their language is 3 letters, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once.  How many 3-letter words are possible?",
        "inference": "**Roman Alphabet:** 26 letters\n**Letters with A:** 5 (A, B, C, D, E)\n\n**First Letter:** 5 choices\n**Second Letter:** 25 choices (excluding first letter)\n**Third Letter:** 24 choices (excluding first and second letter)\n\n**Number of Words:** 5 * 25 * 24 = 30,000\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{30,000}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are $26^3$ possible words that can be formed. Of those words, $25^3$ have no A. Thus, our answer is $26^3 - 25^3 = \\boxed{1951}$."
