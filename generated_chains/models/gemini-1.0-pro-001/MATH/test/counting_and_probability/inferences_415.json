        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDerek's phone number, $336$ - $7624,$ has the property that the three-digit prefix, $336,$ equals the product of the last four digits, $7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 4.$ How many seven-digit phone numbers beginning with $336$ have this property?",
        "inference": "The three-digit prefix is $336.$ The product of the last four digits is $7 \\times 6 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 336.$ So the last four digits must be $7624.$ \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \\cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \\begin{align*}\n&1, 6, 7, 8\\\\\n&2, 4, 6, 7\\\\\n&2, 3, 7, 8 \\\\\n&3, 4, 4, 7\n\\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \\cdot 24 + 12 = \\boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property."
