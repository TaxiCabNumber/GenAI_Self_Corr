At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can we seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)",
        "inference": "There are 5! ways to seat the 5 people other than Fred and Gwen (since they are sitting opposite each other).  That is 120 ways.  \n\nTo account for the rotation around the table we divide by 6, since the table is round.\n\nTherefore the number of ways is: 120/6\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 choices of seats for Fred to sit in.  Once Fred is seated, then Gwen must sit opposite him.  This leaves 4 people to place in the four remaining seats, which can be done in $4!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 6 to account for the 6 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\\dfrac{6 \\times 1 \\times 4!}{6} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$.  Alternatively, we could start by fixing the table around Fred, thus removing the rotation.  There is 1 option for Gwen's seat, since she must sit across from him.  This leaves 4 people to place in four unique seats, so the number of arrangements is $4! = \\boxed{24}$."
