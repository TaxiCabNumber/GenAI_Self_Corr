At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA school organization consists of 5 teachers, 7 parents and 6 students. A subcommittee of this group is formed by choosing 2 teachers, 3 parents and 3 students. How many different subcommittees can be formed?",
        "inference": "First, we need to calculate the number of ways 2 teachers can be chosen from 5:\nC(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5-2)!) = 10\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways 3 parents can be chosen from 7:\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the number of ways 3 students can be chosen from 6:\nC(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6-3)!) = 20\n\nThe total number of different subcommittees that can be formed is then:\n10 * 35 * 20 = 7000\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7000}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can break this problem into three parts.  First, we will count the number of ways to choose teachers for the subcommittee.  We need to choose 2 teachers from the 5 in the school organization, which gives $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the teachers.  Next, we choose parents.  We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.  Each of these selections is independent, so the total number of possible subcommittees will be $10\\cdot 35\\cdot 20=\\boxed{7000}$."
