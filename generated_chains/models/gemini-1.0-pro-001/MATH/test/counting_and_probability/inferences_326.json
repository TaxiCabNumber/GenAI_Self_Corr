At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Greek army contained two types of soldiers: the upper class and the lower class soldiers. If there were a total of 5 upper class soldiers, and 10 lower class soldiers in a certain part of Athens, and the battle of Thermopylae demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers, how many different battalions can be sent?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the number of ways to select 4 upper class soldiers from a total of 5. This can be done using combinations:\n\n```\nC(5, 4) = 5! / (4! * 1!) = 5\n```\n\n**Step 2**: Find the number of ways to select 8 lower class soldiers from a total of 10. This can be done using combinations:\n\n```\nC(10, 8) = 10! / (8! * 2!) = 45\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Multiply the number of ways to select the upper class soldiers by the number of ways to select the lower class soldiers to get the total number of different battalions:\n\n```\n5 * 45 = 225\n```\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$225$}. I hope it is correct.**",
