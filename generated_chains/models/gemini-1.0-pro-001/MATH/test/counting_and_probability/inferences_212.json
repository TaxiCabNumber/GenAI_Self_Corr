        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct positive integers can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\\}$?",
        "inference": "We can pair the numbers in the set in ${7 \\choose 2} = 21$ ways.\nEach pair represents a single positive integer, so there are 21 distinct positive integers that can be represented as the difference of two numbers in the set.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{21}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since all of the integers are odd, the differences between any pair of them is always even. So, $13 - 1 = 12$ is the largest even integer that could be one of the differences. The smallest positive (even) integer that can be a difference is 2. So, the integers include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$ integers."
