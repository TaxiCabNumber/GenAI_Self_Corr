At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many subsets of the set of divisors of $72$ contain only composite numbers? For example, $\\{8,9\\}$ and $\\{4,8,12\\}$ are two such sets. Include the empty set in your count.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe divisors of $72$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72$. The composite numbers among them are $4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72$. \n\nSince the empty set is included, there are $2^{9}$ subsets of the set of divisors of $72$. \n\nAmong them, there are $2^{8}$ subsets that contain only composite numbers. \n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2^{8}=256}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \\cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors."
