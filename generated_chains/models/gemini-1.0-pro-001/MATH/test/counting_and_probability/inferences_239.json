At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if two balls are indistinguishably green, two are indistinguishably red, and the boxes are distinguishable?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: First, we need to place one of the green balls in one of the three boxes. There are three ways to do this.\n\n**Step 2**: Next, we need to place the second green ball in one of the three boxes. However, since the boxes are distinguishable, and one of the balls is already in one of the boxes. There are two ways to do this.\n\n**Step 3**: Now, we need to place one of the red balls in one of the three boxes. Again, there are three ways to do this.\n\n**Step 4**: Finally, we need to place the second red ball in one of the three boxes. Since one of the balls is already in one of the boxes, there are two ways to do this.\n\n**Step 5**: Multiply the number of ways to do each step to find the total number of ways to put the balls in the boxes.\n\n* 3 (placing one green ball) * 2 (placing the second green ball) * 3 (placing one red ball) * 2 (placing the second red ball) = 36\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$36$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \\times 6 = \\boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls."
