At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf you flip a fair coin four times, what is the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Determine the probability of flipping a head on a single flip.\nP(head) = 1/2\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the probability of flipping three heads in a row.\nP(3 heads) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8\n\n**Step 3:** Determine the probability of flipping at least three heads in a row.\nThis is the probability of flipping three heads or four heads.\nP(at least 3 heads) = P(3 heads) + P(4 heads)\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the probability of flipping four heads.\nP(4 heads) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16\n\n**Step 5:** Add the probabilities from steps 3 and 4 to get the final probability.\nP(at least 3 heads) = 1/8 + 1/16 = 3/16\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{16}$}** I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The quickest way to solve this problem is to count the number of outomes that have three heads in a row, as we already know very clearly that there are $2^4$ outcomes total. So, HHHH, HHHT, THHH are the only 3 outcomes that have three consecutive heads. So, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
