At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo circles with spinners at their centers are divided into three equal regions as shown. When both spinners are spun, what is the probability that the product of the two values is negative? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        "inference": "The product of the two values will be negative if and only if _both_ values are negative. The probability of the first spinner landing on -1 is 1/3. The probability of the second spinner landing on -6 is 1/3. So the probability of _both_ spinners landing on negative numbers is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$."
