At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many integers $n$ where $2 \\le n \\le 100$ is $\\binom{n}{2}$ odd?",
        "inference": "There are 50 odd integers between 2 and 100, inclusive: 3, 5, 7, ..., 99.\n\nTherefore, there are 50 integers $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{2}$ is odd.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{50}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "$\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. In order for this fraction to be odd, neither $n$ nor $n-1$ can be divisible by $4$, because only one of $n$ and $n-1$ can be even. There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \\boxed{50}$ valid integers."
