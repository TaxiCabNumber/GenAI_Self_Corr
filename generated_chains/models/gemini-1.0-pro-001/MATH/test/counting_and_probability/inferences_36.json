At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "The square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, and the square root of 1000 is approximately 31.62. So, the perfect squares between 10 and 1000 are those with a square root between 3.16 and 31.62.\n\nTo find the number of perfect squares, we can count the number of integers between 3 and 31 (inclusive) and subtract 1 to account for the fact that 1 is not a perfect square.\n\nSo, the number of perfect squares between 10 and 1000 is:\n```\n31 - 3 - 1 = 27\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$27$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can see that $3^2 = 9 < 10 < 4^2 = 16$. Thus, $4^2 = 16$ is the smallest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nWe also see that $31^2 = 961 < 1000 < 32^2 = 1024$. Thus, $31^2 = 961$ is the greatest perfect square between 10 and 1000.\n\nIt follows that there are $31 - 4 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$ perfect squares between 10 and 1000."
