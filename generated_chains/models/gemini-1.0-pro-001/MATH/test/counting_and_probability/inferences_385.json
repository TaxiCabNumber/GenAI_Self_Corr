        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many nine-digit numbers can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with the digits alternating between odd and even?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. We can arrange the digits in the following way:\n\n1. Start with an odd digit.\n2. Follow it with an even digit.\n3. Follow it with an odd digit.\n4. Follow it with an even digit.\n5. Follow it with an odd digit.\n6. Follow it with an even digit.\n7. Follow it with an odd digit.\n8. Follow it with an even digit.\n9. End with an odd digit.\n\nThere are 5 choices for the first digit (any of the odd digits). For each of these choices, there are 4 choices for the second digit (any of the even digits except the one used for the first digit). For each of these choices, there are 3 choices for the third digit (any of the odd digits except the one used for the first digit and the one used for the second digit), and so on. Therefore, the number of nine-digit numbers that can be made using each of the digits 1 through 9 exactly once with the digits alternating between odd and even is\n\n5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = **2880**.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2880}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are five odd digits and four even digits to be used. Because the digits must alternate between odd and even, this means that there is only one possible way to distribute odds (O) and evens (E): OEOEOEOEO. Now, there are $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 = 120$ ways to arrange the odd numbers, as there are five choices for the first slot, four for the second, and so on. Similarly, there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ ways to arrange the even numbers. Our final answer is the product of $120$ and $24$, which is $\\boxed{2880}$."
