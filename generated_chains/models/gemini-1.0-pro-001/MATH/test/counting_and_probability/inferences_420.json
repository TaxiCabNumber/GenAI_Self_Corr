At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the total number of four-digit palindromes. (Recall that a palindrome is a nonnegative sequence of digits which reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 1331. Zero cannot be the first digit.)",
        "inference": "Solution:\nA four-digit palindrome can be written as $1000a+100b+10c+d,$ where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are digits. Since $a$ cannot be $0,$ there are $9$ choices for $a.$ Once $a$ is chosen, there are $10$ choices for $b,c,$ and $d.$ Therefore, there are $9\\cdot10^3=9000$ four-digit palindromes.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9000}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In a four-digit palindrome, the first digit is the same as the last, and the second digit is the same as the third digit.  There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).  This gives us $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes."
