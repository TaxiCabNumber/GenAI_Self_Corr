        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe digits 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 will be put in random order to make a positive five-digit integer. What is the probability that the resulting integer will be divisible by 11? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "An integer is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. In the context of the problem, there are $5!$ ways to order the digits, out of which $2!$ ways make the digits in even positions equal to 2 and 8. For each such way, there are $3!$ ways to order the remaining digits 3, 4 and 7. Thus, there are $2! \\cdot 3! = 12$ ways to order the digits so that the alternating sum of the digits is even. Since there are $5!$ ways to order the digits, the probability that the resulting integer is divisible by 11 is $\\frac{12}{5!} = \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the resulting integer is divisible by 11 then the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits has the same remainder when divided by 11 as the sum of the second and fourth digits. This only occurs when the first, third, and fifth digits are 2, 3, and 7 (in some order) and the second and fourth digits are 4 and 8 (in some order).\n\nThere are $\\binom{5}{2}$ total ways to partition these five digits into a group of 3 and a group of 2. From above, only one of these partitions will result in five-digit integers that are divisible by 11. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$."
