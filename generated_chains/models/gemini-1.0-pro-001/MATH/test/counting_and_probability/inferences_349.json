        "ground_truth": "We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\\dfrac{5\\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\times\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3\\times10=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\\dbinom{5}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^3=\\boxed{\\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method."
