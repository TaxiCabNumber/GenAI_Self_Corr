At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA club has 20 members, 12 boys and 8 girls.  Two of the members are chosen at random.  What is the probability that a boy and a girl are chosen?",
        "inference": "The probability of choosing a boy is 12/20. \nThe probability of choosing a girl is 8/20. \nThe probability of choosing a boy and a girl is (12/20) * (8/20) = 96/400 = 6/25.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{6}{25}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are $\\binom{20}{2} = 190$ ways to choose two members of the group. There are $12$ ways to choose a boy and $8$ ways to choose a girl for a total of $12 \\cdot 8 = 96$ ways to choose a boy and a girl.  This means that there is a $\\dfrac{96}{190} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{48}{95}}$ chance that the two random members of the group are a boy and a girl."
