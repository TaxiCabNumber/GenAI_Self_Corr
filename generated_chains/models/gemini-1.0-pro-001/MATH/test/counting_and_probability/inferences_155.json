        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen flips a fair nickel four times. What is the probability that Ben flips Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The probability of getting a Head on any single flip is 1/2. The probability of getting a Tail on any single flip is also 1/2. Since the flips are independent, the probability of getting Head, Tail, Head, Tail, in that order is:\n\n1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{1}{16}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since any given flip has equal probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of being a Head or a Tail, and all outcomes are equally likely, the precise sequence given is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$."
