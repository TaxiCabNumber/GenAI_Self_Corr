At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA solid 6-by-6-by-6 cube is constructed from unit cubes and the entire outer surface is painted. What fraction of the unit cubes has at least two painted faces? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "* There are 8 cubes on each face, so there are 6 * 8 = 48 cubes on the surface of the cube.\n* There are 4 cubes on each corner, so there are 8 * 4 = 32 cubes that have three painted faces.\n* There are 12 edges, each with 2 cubes, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 cubes that have two painted faces.\n* There are 6 * 6 * 6 - 48 - 24 - 32 = 128 cubes that have zero or one painted face.\n* The fraction of cubes with at least two painted faces is (48 + 24) / 216 = 72 / 216 = 1 / 3.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{1/3}. I hope it is correct.",
