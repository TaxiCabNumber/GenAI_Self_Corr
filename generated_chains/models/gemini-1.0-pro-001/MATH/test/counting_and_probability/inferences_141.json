She has a 1/4 probability of solving it each day.  What is the probability that she will solve it before her sixth try?",

The probability of failure on each try is $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$, so the probability that she fails on each of her first 5 tries is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^5 = \\frac{243}{1024}$.
