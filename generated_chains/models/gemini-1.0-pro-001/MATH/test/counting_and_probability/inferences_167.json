        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMs. Hamilton's eighth-grade class wants to participate in the annual three-person-team basketball tournament.  Lance, Sally, Joy, and Fred are chosen for the team.  In how many ways can the three starters be chosen?",
        "inference": "There are 4 choices for the first starter; 3 choices for the second starter, and 2 choices for the third starter.  Thus, we have:\n$$4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2=24$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "When three players start, one is the alternate.  Because any of the four players might be the alternate, there are four ways to select a starting team: Lance-Sally-Joy, Lance-Sally-Fred, Lance-Joy-Fred, and Sally-Joy-Fred.  Or, we can simply note that we have $\\boxed{4}$ choices for who to leave out!"
