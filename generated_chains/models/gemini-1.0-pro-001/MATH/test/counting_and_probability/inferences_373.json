        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe planning committee at school has 11 members. Exactly five of these members are teachers. A four-person subcommittee with at least one member who is not a teacher must be formed from the members of the planning committee. How many distinct subcommittees are possible?",
        "inference": "The non-teacher (NT) members can be selected in $11-5 = 6$ ways. There are 4 NT members and 4 available positions, so $4^4$ possible arrangements of NT members. The teacher (T) members can be selected in $5$ ways. There are 5 T members and 1 available position, so there is only one arrangement of T members. Therefore, the total number of distinct subcommittees is\n\n$$6 \\times 4^4 \\times 5 = 3,456$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3,456}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \\choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \\choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \\boxed{325}$."
