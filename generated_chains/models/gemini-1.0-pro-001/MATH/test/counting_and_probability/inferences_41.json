        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA state had three letters followed by three digits as the format for license plates. In order to increase the number of plates available, the state changed the format to four letters followed by two digits. What is the positive difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the number of plates available with the old format.\n\nThere are 26 possible letters for each of the three letter positions, and 10 possible digits for each of the three digit positions. So, the total number of plates available with the old format is:\n\n$$26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 17,576,000$$\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the number of plates available with the new format.\n\nThere are 26 possible letters for each of the four letter positions, and 10 possible digits for each of the two digit positions. So, the total number of plates available with the new format is:\n\n$$26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 26 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 456,976,000$$\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the difference between the number of plates available with the new format and the number of plates available with the old format.\n\nThe difference is:\n\n$$456,976,000 - 17,576,000 = 439,400,000$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$439,400,000$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "With the original format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first three slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last three. Therefore, there are $26^3 \\cdot 10^3$ license plates possible. With the new format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first four slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last two: thus, there are now $26^4 \\cdot 10^2$ license plates possible. Subtracting the two yields an answer of $26^3 \\cdot 10^2 \\cdot (26 - 10)$, which equals $\\boxed{28121600}$."
