There are 2 ways to choose an even number from the first six primes: 2 and 6.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.

        "ground_truth": "The only way for the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose to be odd is if one of them chooses 2 and the other chooses an odd prime. There are five ways for Paul to choose 2 and Jesse to choose an odd prime, and there are five ways for Jesse to choose 2 and Paul to choose an odd prime. Since there are $6\\cdot 6=36$ total possible ways for Paul and Jesse to choose their numbers, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is NOT even is $\\frac{10}{36}=\\frac{5}{18}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose IS even is $1-\\frac{5}{18}=\\boxed{\\frac{13}{18}}$."
