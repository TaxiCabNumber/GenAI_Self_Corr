At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n**Step 1: Find the number of zeros at the end of 100!**\n- Every number from 1 to 100 has 20 factors of 5.\n- Therefore, 100! has 20 factors of 5.\n- Each factor of 5 can be paired with a factor of 2 to form a factor of 10.\n- 100! also has 10 factors of 10.\n- Therefore, 100! has 10 zeros at the end.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of zeros at the end of 200!**\n- 200! has 40 factors of 5.\n- 200! has 20 factors of 10.\n- Therefore, 200! has 20 zeros at the end.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of zeros at the end of 300!**\n- 300! has 60 factors of 5.\n- 300! has 30 factors of 10.\n- Therefore, 300! has 30 zeros at the end.\n\n**Step 4: Add the number of zeros for each factorial.**\n- The product of 100!, 200!, and 300! has 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 zeros at the end.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$60$}.

        "ground_truth": "The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.\n\nTo count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5}\\right\\rfloor$ means \"divide 100 by 5 and round down.\")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.\n\nSimilarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$. So, our answer is $24 + 49 + 74 = \\boxed{147}$."
