At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob and Meena play a two-person game which is won by the first person to accumulate 10 points. At each turn Bob gains a point with probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ . If he doesn't get a point, then Meena gets a point. Meena is now ahead 9 to 8. What is the probability that Meena will win? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "Let $P_n$ be the probability that Bob wins with $n$ points and Meena with $9-n$ points.
