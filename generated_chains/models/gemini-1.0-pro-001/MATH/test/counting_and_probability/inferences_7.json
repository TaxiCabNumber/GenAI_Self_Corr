At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray. How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected? (Note that cookies of the same type are not distinguishable.)",
        "inference": "The number of ways to choose 6 cookies from the chocolate chip cookies is:\n\n$$C(6,6) = 1.$$\n\nThe number of ways to choose 6 cookies from the oatmeal cookies is:\n\n$$C(6,6) = 1.$$\n\nThe number of ways to choose 6 cookies from the peanut butter cookies is:\n\n$$C(6,6) = 1.$$\n\nTherefore, the number of different assortments of 6 cookies that can be selected is:\n\n$$1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1.$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The numbers of the three types of cookies must have a sum of six. Possible sets of whole numbers whose sum is six are \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ 0,3,3;\\ 1,1,4;\\ 1,2,3;\\ \\ \\text{and}\\ 2,2,2.\n\\]Every ordering of each of these sets determines a different assortment of cookies. There are 3 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,0,6;\\ 0,3,3;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,1,4.\n\\]There are 6 orders for each of the sets \\[\n0,1,5;\\ 0,2,4;\\ \\text{and}\\ 1,2,3.\n\\]There is only one order for $2,2,2$. Therefore the total number of assortments of six cookies is $3\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{28}$."
