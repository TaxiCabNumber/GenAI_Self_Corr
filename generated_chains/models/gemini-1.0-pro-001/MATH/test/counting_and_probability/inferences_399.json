At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn integer $x$, with $10 \\leq x \\leq 99$, is to be chosen.  If all choices are equally likely, what is the probability that at least one digit of $x$ is a 7?",
        "inference": "Let \\(E\\) be the event that at least one digit of \\(x\\) is a 7.\n\nThe complementary event \\(\\overline{E}\\) is that neither digit of \\(x\\) is a 7.  Hence, the probability of event \\(E\\) is\n$$P(E)=1-P(\\overline{E}).$$\n\nNow, there are 9 choices for each of the two digits of \\(x\\).  Given that neither digit of \\(x\\) is a 7, there are 8 choices for each of the two digits.  Hence,\n$$P(\\overline{E})=\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^2.$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$P(E)=1-\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right)^2=1-\\frac{64}{81}=\\frac{81-64}{81}=\\frac{17}{81}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{\\frac{17}{81}}$$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "There are 90 possible choices for $x$.  Ten of these have a tens digit of 7, and nine have a units digit of 7.  Because 77 has been counted twice, there are $10 + 9 - 1 = 18$ choices of $x$ for which at least one digit is a 7.  Therefore the probability is $\\frac{18}{90} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$."
