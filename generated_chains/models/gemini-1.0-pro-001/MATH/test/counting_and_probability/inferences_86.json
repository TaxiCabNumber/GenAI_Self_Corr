        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA complete cycle of a traffic light takes 60 seconds. During each cycle the light is green for 25 seconds, yellow for 5 seconds, and red for 30 seconds. At a randomly chosen time, what is the probability that the light will NOT be green?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "The light is not green for 5 + 30 = 35 seconds out of every 60 seconds. So the probability that the light will not be green is 35/60 = 7/12.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{7/12}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The probability that it will be green is $\\frac{25}{60}=\\frac{5}{12}$. So the probability that it is not green is simply $1-\\frac{5}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$."
