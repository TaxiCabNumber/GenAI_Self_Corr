        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $n$ be the number of the row in Pascal's Triangle, and let $k$ be the diagonal. Then the value of the $k$th diagonal on row $n$ is given by $\\binom{n}{k-1}$.  Since the numbers on the third diagonal are triangular numbers, we know that\n\n$$\\binom{n}{3-1} = 1+2+\\ldots +n$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\binom{n}{2} = 1+2+\\ldots +n$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n(n-1) = n(n+1)$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n^2 - n = n^2 + n$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 2n = 0$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow n = 0$$\n\nHowever, this is not valid because $n$ cannot be $0$.
