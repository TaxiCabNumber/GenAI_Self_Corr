At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?",
        "inference": "Let $p$ be the probability of drawing a black ball.\n\nSince there are 5 white balls and $k$ black balls, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{5}{5+k} + p = 1$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow p = \\frac{k}{5+k}$$\n\nThe expected loss is:\n\n$$\\frac{5}{5+k} \\times 1 + \\frac{k}{5+k} \\times (-1) = -\\frac{5}{5+k}$$\n\nSince the expected loss is 50 cents, we have:\n\n$$-\\frac{5}{5+k} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow 5+k = 10$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{5}.$$\nFinal Answer: $5$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \\[ E = \\frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \\frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}. \\] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\\boxed{k = 15}$."
