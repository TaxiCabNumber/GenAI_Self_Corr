        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn how many ways can the letters of the word BANANA be rearranged such that the new word does not begin with a B?",
        "inference": "Since the word has 6 letters, the number of rearrangements is 6!. Since B cannot be the first letter, there are 5 choices for the first letter. Thus the number of rearrangements that start with a B is 5 * 5!. Therefore the number of arrangements with no Bs in the first spot is: 6! - 5 * 5! = 5! * (6 - 5) = 5!\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$5!$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The first thing to do is place the B since it has a restriction on it. We can put it anywhere but the first place, so we have 5 options. Once we have done that, we just need to place the two N's and then the rest of the spots will just be A's. We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N. However, the two N's are identical, which means that we've counted each new word twice. So our answer is $\\frac{5\\times5\\times4}{2}=\\boxed{50}$."
