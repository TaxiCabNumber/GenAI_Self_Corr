        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe two positive integer solutions of the equation $x^2 - mx + n = 0$ are $k$ and $t$, where $m$ and $n$ are both prime numbers and $k > t$. What is the value of $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k$?",
        "inference": "Using Vieta's formulas, we have $k + t = m$ and $kt = n$. Since $m$ and $n$ are prime, they are both odd.  Therefore, $k$ and $t$ must be even and odd, respectively.  Since $k > t$, we have $k = 2$ and $t = 1$.  Thus, $m = k + t = 3$ and $n = kt = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = 3^2 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 1^2 = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{20}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From $x^2-mx+n=0$, we get $k+t=m$ and $kt=n$. Since $n$ is prime, one of $k$ and $t$ is $n$ and the other is 1. $k>t$, so $k=n$ and $t=1$. Then $m=n+1$. $m$ is also prime, so we have two consecutive integers that are prime. Since one of every two consecutive integers is even, and the only even prime is 2, we must have $n=2$ and $m=3$. Therefore, $m^n+n^m+k^t+t^k= 3^2+2^3+2^1+1^2=9+8+2+1=\\boxed{20}$."
