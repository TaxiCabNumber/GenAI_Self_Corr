It follows that $P(y) = (y-y)^3 + (y-z)^3 + (z-y)^3 = 0$, so $y$ is a root of $P(x) = 0$ and $x-y$ divides into $P(x)$. By symmetry, it follows that $y-z$ and $z-x$ divide into $P(x)$. Since $P$ is a cubic in its variables, it follows that $P = k(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)$, where $k$ is a constant. By either expanding the definition of $P$, or by trying test values (if we take $x = 0, y = -1, z = 1$, we obtain $P = -6 = k \\cdot (-2)$), it follows that $k = 3$.
