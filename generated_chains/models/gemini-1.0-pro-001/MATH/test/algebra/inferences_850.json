        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{x-3}{x^2+7x-30}$ have?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe denominator of the fraction is equal to zero when $x^2+7x-30=0$. Factoring, we get:\n\n$$(x+10)(x-3)=0$$\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes occur at $x=-10$ and $x=3$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Factoring the denominator $x^2 + 7x - 30$, we get \\[y = \\frac{x - 3}{x^2 + 7x - 30} = \\frac{x - 3}{(x-3)(x+10)}.\\]The graph has a vertical asymptote at $x = -10$.  There is no vertical asymptote at $x = 3$, because the factors of $x - 3$ in the numerator and denominator cancel.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{1}$ vertical asymptote."
