        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 32$), then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the revenue as a function of price.\n\nRevenue = Price * Quantity Sold\nRevenue = $p * (128 - 4p)$\nRevenue = $128p - 4p^2$\n\n**Step 2:** Find the derivative of the revenue function.\n\nRevenue' = $128 - 8p$\n\n**Step 3:** Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point.\n\n$128 - 8p = 0$\n$8p = 128$\n$p = 16$\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the concavity of the revenue function.\n\nRevenue'' = $-8 < 0$, so the revenue function is concave down.\n\n**Step 5:** Check the critical point.\n\nSince the revenue function is concave down and has a critical point at $p = 16$, this critical point is a maximum.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{$16}. I hope it is correct.$",
        "ground_truth": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.\n\nAlternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum."
