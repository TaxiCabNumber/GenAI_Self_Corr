At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $x$ be a value such that $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0$ and $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0.$ What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a simplified common fraction.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = 0$, we have $(3x+2)(3x-8) = 0$, so either $3x+2 = 0$ or $3x-8 = 0$.  Thus, $3x = -2$ or $3x = 8$, so $x = -\\frac{2}{3}$ or $x = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nSince $15x^2 + 28x + 12 = 0$, we have $(5x+4)(3x+3) = 0$, so either $5x+4 = 0$ or $3x+3 = 0$.  Thus, $5x = -4$ or $3x = -3$, so $x = -\\frac{4}{5}$ or $x = -1$.\n\nSince $x$ must satisfy both equations, we have $x = -\\frac{2}{3}$ or $x = -1$.  Thus, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We solve each equation separately. First off, we have $9x^2 - 18x - 16 = (3x+2)(3x-8) = 0.$ We can also see that $15x^2+28x+12 = (3x+2)(5x+6) = 0.$ It is clear that both equations are satisfied only when $3x + 2 = 0,$ therefore $x = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}.$"
