        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn audience of $450$ people is seated in an auditorium. Each row contains the same number of seats and each seat in the auditorium is occupied. With three fewer seats per row, and five extra rows, the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats. How many rows does the auditorium have?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of rows in the auditorium.\nSince each row contains the same number of seats, the total number of seats is $450/x$.\nWith three fewer seats per row, the number of seats per row would be $450/x - 3$.\nWith five extra rows, the number of rows would be $x + 5$.\nSince the same audience could still be seated, occupying all seats, we have\n\n$$450/x = (450/x - 3)(x + 5)$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad 450 = 450 + 2250/x - 15x - 9x$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad 24x = 2250/x - 9x$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad 33x = 2250/x$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad x^2 = 2250/33 = 68.18$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\sqrt{68.18} = 8.26$$\n\nSince the number of rows must be a whole number, we have $x = 8$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $r$ be the number of rows, and $s$ be the number of seats per row. It follows that $rs = 450$ and $(r + 5)(s - 3) = 450$. Expanding the second equation, it follows that $rs - 3r + 5s - 15 = 450$, and substituting the value of $rs$, it follows that $3r - 5s + 15 = 0$. Substituting $s = \\frac{450}{r}$ into this new equation, we obtain that $$3r - 5 \\cdot \\frac{450}{r}+ 15 = 0 \\Longrightarrow r +5 -\\frac{750}{r} = 0.$$ Multiplying both sides of the equation by $r$ yields the quadratic equation $r^2 + 5r - 750 = 0$, which factors as $(r + 30)(r - 25) = 0$. Thus, $r = \\boxed{25}$."
