At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA company that sells widgets has to pay $\\$1000$ in one-time equipment fees and then it costs $\\$0.50$ for each widget it makes. It sells widgets at a price of $\\$2.75$ per widget. What is the least number of widgets the company has to sell in order to make a profit?",
