        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $m$ is a real number and $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots, then what are the possible values of $m$?  Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $2x^2+mx+8=0$ is $m^2-32$.  For the quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than $0$.  Therefore, we have $m^2-32>0$.  Solving this inequality, we get $m<-4\\sqrt{2}$ or $m>4\\sqrt{2}$.  In interval notation, the possible values of $m$ are $(-\\infty,-4\\sqrt{2})\\cup(4\\sqrt{2},\\infty)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-4\\sqrt{2})\\cup(4\\sqrt{2},\\infty)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By considering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-8)\\cup (8,\\infty)}$."
