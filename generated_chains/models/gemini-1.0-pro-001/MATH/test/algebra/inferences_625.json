        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo cones have the same volume. If one has a base with radius 3 times as large as the other's and a height of 24 inches, how many inches tall is the other?\n\nNote: The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.",
        "inference": "Let $r_1$ and $h_1$ represent the radius and height of the first cone, and let $r_2$ and $h_2$ represent the radius and height of the second cone. Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Write the given information: $V_1 = V_2, r_1 = 3r_2, h_1 = 24$\n2. Use the formula for the volume of a cone: $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$\n3. Substitute the given values into the volume formula for the first cone: $V_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (r_1)^2 h_1$\n4. Substitute the given values into the volume formula for the second cone: $V_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (r_2)^2 h_2$\n5. Set the two volume equations equal since the volume of the two cones is the same: $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (r_1)^2 h_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (r_2)^2 h_2$\n6. Cancel the common terms: $\\pi = \\pi$ and $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n7. Substitute $r_1 = 3r_2$ from the given information: $(3r_2)^2 h_1 = r_2^2 h_2$\n8. Expand and simplify: $9r_2^2 h_1 = r_2^2 h_2$\n9. Divide both sides by $r_2^2$: $9h_1 = h_2$\n10. Solve for $h_2$: $h_2 = \\frac{9h_1}{9} = h_1$\n11. Substitute the given height $h_1 = 24$ inches: $h_2 = 24$ inches\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$24$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The volume is proportional to the square of the base radius and to the height, so if these have the same volume, their heights are inversely proportional to the square of the radii. This means that with a radius 1/3 as big as the first, the second cone has a height of $24\\left(\\frac1{1/3}\\right)^2=24\\cdot9=\\boxed{216}$ inches."
