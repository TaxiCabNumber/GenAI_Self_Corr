        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the greatest prime factor of the sum of the arithmetic sequence $1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 80$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION**\nNote that the sum is the sum of two arithmetic series:\n$$\\begin{split} 1+2+3+\\cdots +80 & = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\\\\\ & = \\frac{80(80+1)}{2} \\\\\\ & = 3240. \\end{split}$$\n\nSince $3240=2^4\\cdot 3\\cdot 5$, its prime factorization contains $2^4$ as the highest power of $2$. Therefore, the greatest prime factor of $3240$ is $2^4$, i.e. $16$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$16$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1+2+3+\\dots+80=\\frac{80 \\cdot 81}{2}=40\\cdot81=2^3\\cdot5\\cdot3^4$. Thus, the greatest prime factor of the sum is $\\boxed{5}$."
