        "inference": "The $y$-intercept of the line is the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. The $y$-coordinate of this point is called the $y$-intercept.\n\nThe given line passes through the point $(4,365)$. This means that the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept is $365$.\n\nThe $y$-intercept is on or between $1$ and $9$. This means that $1 \\le y \\le 9$.\n\nThe slope of a line is defined as the ratio of the change in $y$ to the change in $x$. If the $y$-intercept is $y$, then the change in $y$ is $365 - y$. The change in $x$ is $4$.\n\nThe slope of the line is $\\frac{365-y}{4}$.\n\nThe minimum possible slope of the line is when the $y$-intercept is as large as possible. This means that $y = 9$.\n\nThe slope of the line when $y = 9$ is $\\frac{365-9}{4} = \\frac{356}{4} = 89$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{89}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We don't know the $y$-intercept, so let the $y$-intercept be $a$, where $1\\le a \\le 9$. Our line contains the points $(0,a)$ and $(4,365)$, so its slope is $\\frac{365-a}{4-0}=\\frac{365-a}{4}$. We are trying to find the smallest possible value of this expression, to minimize the slope. The denominator is fixed, so we must find the smallest possible value of the numerator, $365-a$. The smallest value will occur when $a$ is as large as possible, so $a=9$. Then the slope will be $\\frac{365-9}{4}=\\frac{356}{4}=\\boxed{89}$."
