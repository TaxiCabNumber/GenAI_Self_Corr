        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4$ relates the height $y$ (in meters) to the elapsed time $t$ (in seconds) for a ball thrown downward at 3.5 meters per second from a height of 2.4 meters from the ground. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
        "inference": "To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to find the time $t$ when the height $y$ is 0. Substituting $y = 0$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$$0 = -4.9t^2 - 3.5t + 2.4$$\n\nSolving for $t$ using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n$$t = \\frac{-(-3.5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3.5)^2 - 4(-4.9)(2.4)}}{2(-4.9)} = \\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{12.25 + 47.04}}{-9.8}$$\n\n$$t = \\frac{3.5 \\pm \\sqrt{59.29}}{-9.8} \\approx -0.73 \\text{ or } 0.6$$\n\nSince the ball cannot hit the ground before it is thrown, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the ball will hit the ground in $t \\approx 0.6$ seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.60}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Setting $y$ equal to zero, we find the following: \\begin{align*}\n0& = -4.9t^2 -3.5t + 2.4\\\\\n& = 49t^2 + 35t - 24\\\\\n& = (7t-3)(7t + 8)\\\\\n\\end{align*}As $t$ must be positive, we can see that $t = \\frac{3}{7} \\approx \\boxed{0.43}.$"
