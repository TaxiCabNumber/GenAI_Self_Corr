        "ground_truth": "Rewrite the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $(h,k)$ are the coordinates of the vertex. If the parabola has a vertical line of symmetry at $x=1$, then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=1$, so $h=1$. The equation of the parabola becomes $y=a(x-1)^2+k$. Plugging in the two given points into this equation, we have the two equations \\begin{align*}\n3&=a(-1-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow 3=4a+k\\\\\n-2&=a(2-1)^2+k \\Rightarrow -2=a+k\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $5=3a$, so $a=5/3$. Plugging this value into the second equation to solve for $k$, we find that $k=-11/3$. So the equation of the parabola is $y=\\frac{5}{3}(x-1)^2-\\frac{11}{3}$.
