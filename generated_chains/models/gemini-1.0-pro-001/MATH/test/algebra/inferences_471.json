At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf six cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, and four brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, how many cupcakes can Bob buy for the price of eighteen cookies?",
        "inference": "* **Step 1**: If 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, then 1 cookie costs the same as 2/6 = 1/3 of a brownie.\n* **Step 2**: If 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, then 1 brownie costs the same as 10/4 = 5/2 cupcakes.\n* **Step 3**: Therefore, 1 cookie costs the same as (1/3) * (5/2) = 5/6 of a cupcake.\n* **Step 4**: If 18 cookies cost the same as x cupcakes, then x = 18 * (5/6) = 15 cupcakes.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since 6 cookies cost the same as 2 brownies, 18 cookies will cost the same as 6 brownies.  Similarly, 4 brownies cost the same as 10 cupcakes, so 6 brownies will cost the same as $10\\cdot \\frac{6}{4} = 15$ cupcakes.  Therefore, 18 cookies have the same price as $\\boxed{15}$ cupcakes."
