At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -6t^2 + 43t$ describes the height (in feet) of a projectile $t$ seconds after it is launched from the surface of Mars at 43 feet per second. In how many seconds will the projectile first reach 77 feet in height? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest tenth.",
