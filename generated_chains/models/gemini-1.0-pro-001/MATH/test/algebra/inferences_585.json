At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what value of the constant $a$ does the system of equations below have infinitely many solutions?  \\begin{align*} 2x + 5y &= -8,\\\\ 6x &= 16 + a - 15y \\end{align*}",

So, we must have: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{6}&=\\frac{5}{a-15}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6a-90&=60\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6a&=150\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=\\boxed{25}.\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}$.

        "ground_truth": "Putting the $x$ and $y$ terms of the second equation on the left gives $6x+15y = 16+a$. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives $6x + 15y = -24$.  So, our system now is \\begin{align*} 6x+15y &= -24,\\\\ 6x + 15y&=16+a. \\end{align*}This system has infinitely many solutions only if the two right sides are the same, which would make the two equations the same.  So, we must have $-24 = 16+a$, so $a= \\boxed{-40}$."
