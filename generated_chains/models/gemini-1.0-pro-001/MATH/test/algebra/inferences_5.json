At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ...?",
        "inference": "The 100th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: \n$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$$\n\nwhere \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nIn this case, \\(a_1 = 6\\) and \\(d = 4\\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$a_{100} = 6 + (100-1)4$$\n$$a_{100} = 6 + 99 \\times 4 $$\n$$a_{100} = 6 + 396 $$\n$$a_{100} = 402$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{402}.
