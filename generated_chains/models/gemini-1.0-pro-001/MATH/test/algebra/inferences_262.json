At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)=\\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^2+4x+c}$ has a domain of all real numbers?",
        "inference": "The denominator of the function $f(x)$ cannot be zero for any real number $x$. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of $c$ such that $x^2+4x+c=0$ has no real solutions.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2+4x+c=0$ is $4^2-4(1)(c)=16-4c$. For the equation to have no real solutions, the discriminant must be negative. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer value of $c$ such that $16-4c<0$.\n\nSolving the inequality $16-4c<0$, we get $c>4$. The smallest integer value of $c$ that satisfies this inequality is $c=5$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer value of $c$ such that the function $f(x)=\\frac{2x^2+x+5}{x^2+4x+c}$ has a domain of all real numbers is $c=\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The given function has a domain of all real numbers if and only if the denominator is never equal to zero.  In other words, the quadratic $x^2 + 4x + c = 0$ has no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $16 - 4c$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $16 - 4c < 0$, or $c > 4$.  The smallest integer $c$ that satisfies this inequality is $c = \\boxed{5}$."
