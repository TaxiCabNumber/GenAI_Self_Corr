At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $6x^2 + 17x + 5$ can be written in the form $(Ax+1)(Bx+5)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is the value of $AB$?",
        "inference": "Solution: \n\nThe product of the first coefficients is 6, and the product of the last constants is 5. \n\nThe product of the middle coefficients is A*B = 17. \n\nThe only factors of 17 that add up to 17 are 1 and 17. \n\nTherefore, $A = 1$ and $B = 17$. \n\nThe value of AB is: $AB = 1*17 = \\boxed{17}$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$.
