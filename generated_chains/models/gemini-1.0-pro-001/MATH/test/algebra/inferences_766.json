        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMy baseball team won $2/9$ of its games this season.  If we lost 15 more games than we won, how many games did we play this year?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of games played.\n\nWe know that the team won 2/9 of its games, so it won (2/9)x games.\n\nWe also know that the team lost 15 more games than it won, so it lost (2/9)x + 15 games.\n\nSince the team played a total of x games, we can write the equation:\n\n(2/9)x + (2/9)x + 15 = x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(4/9)x + 15 = x\n\nSubtracting (4/9)x from both sides, we get:\n\n15 = (5/9)x\n\nMultiplying both sides by (9/5), we get:\n\n27 = x\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$27$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose we played $x$ games.  Since we won $2/9$ of the games we played, we won $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. Therefore, we lost $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games.  Since we lost 15 more games than we won, we have \\[\\frac{7x}{9} - \\frac{2x}{9} = 15.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $5x/9 = 15$, and solving this equation gives $x = \\boxed{27}$ games played."
