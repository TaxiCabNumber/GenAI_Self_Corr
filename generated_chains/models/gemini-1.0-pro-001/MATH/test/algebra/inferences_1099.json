At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "First, we simplify the denominator of the right side: \\[2 + \\frac{1}{x-2} = \\frac{2(x-2)}{x-2} + \\frac{1}{x-2} = \\frac{2x-4+1}{x-2} = \\frac{2x-3}{x-2}.\\] So, we can now write the right side as \\[\\frac{1}{2+\\dfrac{1}{x-2}} = \\frac{1}{\\phantom{o}\\frac{2x-3}{x-2}\\phantom{0}} = \\frac{x-2}{2x-3},\\] so our equation is  \\[x = \\frac{x-2}{2x-3}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $2x-3$ gives  \\[2x^2 - 3x = x-2,\\] so $2x^2 -4x + 2 = 0$.
