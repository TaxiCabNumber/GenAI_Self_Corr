        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo bricklayers, Alan and David, each place 30 bricks per hour. Alan worked three times as many hours as David, and the two of them placed a total of 600 bricks. How many bricks did David lay?",
        "inference": "Let \\(d\\) be the number of hours David worked. \nThen Alan worked 3d hours and together they laid \\( 30d + 30 (3d) = 120 d\\) bricks. Setting this equal to the given total we get \n\n$$120d = 600$$\n\n$$d = \\frac{600}{120} = 5$$\n\n**Final Answer: $$\\boxed{150}$$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t$ equal the amount of time David worked. Therefore, Alan worked $3t$ hours. They placed a total of $30 \\cdot t +30 \\cdot 3t=600$ bricks. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=5$ hours. Therefore, David placed $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ bricks."
