At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose we define $\\ell(n)$ as follows: If $n$ is an integer from $0$ to $20,$ inclusive, then $\\ell(n)$ is the number of letters in the English spelling of the number $n;$ otherwise, $\\ell(n)$ is undefined. For example, $\\ell(11)=6,$ because \"eleven\" has six letters, but $\\ell(23)$ is undefined, because $23$ is not an integer from $0$ to $20.$\n\nHow many numbers are in the domain of $\\ell(n)$ but not the range of $\\ell(n)?$",

The range of $\\ell(n)$ is the set of numbers of letters in the English spelling of the numbers from $0$ to $20,$ which is a set with $7$ elements: $2,3,4,5,6,7,$ and $8.$ Therefore, the number of numbers in the domain of $\\ell(n)$ but not the range of $\\ell(n)$ is $21-7=\\boxed{14}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}.$ I hope it is correct.",
