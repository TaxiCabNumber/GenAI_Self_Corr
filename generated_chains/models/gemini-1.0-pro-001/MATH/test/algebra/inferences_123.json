        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLine $j$ is perpendicular to $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. What is the slope of line $j$?",
        "inference": "Since the perpendicular line to $y/3 + 2x/5 = 2$ has an undefined slope, its equation is of the form $x = constant$. Hence, the slope of the perpendicular line is $\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the slope of $\\frac{y}{3}+\\frac{2x}{5}=2$. We change the form to slope-intercept form. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $y+\\frac{6x}{5}=6$. Moving the $x$ to the right, we get $y=-\\frac{6x}{5}+6$. The slopes of two perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals. Therefore, the slope of line $j$ is the opposite reciprocal of $-\\frac{6}{5}$ which is $\\boxed{\\frac56}$."
