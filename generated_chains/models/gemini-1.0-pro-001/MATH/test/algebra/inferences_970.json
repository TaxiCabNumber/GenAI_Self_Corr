        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many real values of $x$ is $\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}$ an integer?",
        "inference": "Since $\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer, $63-\\sqrt{x}$ must be a perfect square.  Let the integer be $y$. \n\n$$63-\\sqrt{x}=y^2$$$$y^2+\\sqrt{x}=63$$$$x=63-y^2$$\n\nFor $x$ to be real, $63-y^2 \\ge 0$.  Therefore, $y \\le 7.937$.  Since $y$ is an integer, the possible values of $y$ are $-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.\n\n There are $15$ possible integer values for $y$, so there are $15$ real values of $x$ for which $\\sqrt{63-\\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose that  $k = \\sqrt{63 - \\sqrt{x}}$ is an integer. Then $0\\le k \\le \\sqrt{63}$. 7 is the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{63}$, and since $k$ is an integer, we have $0\\le k \\le 7$. Thus there are 8 possible integer values of $k$. For each such $k$, the corresponding value of $x$ is $\\left(63 - k^2\\right)^2$. Because  $\\left(63 -\nk^2\\right)^2$ is positive and decreasing for $0\\le k \\le 7$, the $\\boxed{8}$ values of $x$ are distinct."
