        "ground_truth": "If the given quadratic equation has one solution, it follows that its discriminant must be equal to $0$. The discriminant of the given quadratic is given by $(2b)^2 - 4(a-b)$, and setting this equal to zero, we obtain another quadratic equation $4b^2 + 4b - 4a = 0$. Since the value of $b$ is unique, it follows that again, the discriminant of this quadratic must be equal to zero. The discriminant is now $(4)^2 - 4(4)(-4a) = 16 + 64a = 0$, so it follows that $a = \\boxed{-0.25}$."
