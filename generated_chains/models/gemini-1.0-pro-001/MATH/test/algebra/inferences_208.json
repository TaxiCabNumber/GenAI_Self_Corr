        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nLet $a$, $b$, $c$ be the sides of the triangle.  Since $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence, we have $a=b-d$ and $c=b+d$ for some integer $d$.  The perimeter of the triangle is $60$, so $a+b+c=60$.  Substituting $a=b-d$ and $c=b+d$, we get $3b=60$, so $b=20$.  Therefore, $a=20-d$ and $c=20+d$.  Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, we have $20-d>0$, $20>0$, and $20+d>0$.  The largest possible value of $d$ is $d=19$, corresponding to $a=1$, $b=20$, and $c=39$, which is not a valid triangle.  The next largest possible value of $d$ is $d=18$, corresponding to $a=2$, $b=20$, and $c=38$, which is a valid triangle.  We can continue this process until we find the smallest possible value of $d$ that corresponds to a valid triangle.  The smallest possible value of $d$ that corresponds to a valid triangle is $d=9$, corresponding to $a=11$, $b=20$, and $c=29$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{11}$ distinct, non-equilateral triangles with a perimeter of 60 units have integer side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a$, $b$, $c$ is an arithmetic sequence.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference, so $a = b - d$ and $c = b + d$.  We can assume that $d$ is positive.  (In particular, $d$ can't be 0, because the triangle is not equilateral.)  Then the perimeter of the triangle is $a + b + c = (b - d) + b + (b + d) = 3b = 60$, so $b = 20$.  Hence, the sides of the triangle are $20 - d$, 20, and $20 + d$.\n\nThese sides must satisfy the triangle inequality, which gives us \\[(20 - d) + 20 > 20 + d.\\] Solving for $d$, we find $2d < 20$, or $d < 10$.  Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are 1, 2, $\\dots$, 9, which gives us $\\boxed{9}$ possible triangles."
