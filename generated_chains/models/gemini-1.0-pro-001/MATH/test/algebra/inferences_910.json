At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the 7th term is 30, and the 11th term is 60. What is the 21st term of this sequence?",
        "inference": "Let d be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.  The 7th term is given by a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 30.  The 11th term is given by a_11 = a_1 + 10d = 60.  Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we have 30 + 4d = 60, which gives d = 7.5.  Substituting d back into the first equation, we have a_1 = 30 - 6d = 15.  Therefore, the 21st term is given by a_21 = a_1 + 20d = 15 + 20(7.5) = 165.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{165}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term in this arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $7^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 6d = 30$, and the $11^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 10d = 60$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $4d = 30$, so $d = 30/4 = 15/2$.\n\nThen the $21^{\\text{st}}$ term is $a + 20d = (a + 10d) + 10d = 60 + 10 \\cdot 15/2 = \\boxed{135}$."
