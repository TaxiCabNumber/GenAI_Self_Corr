        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA rectangular patio has an area of $180$ square feet and a perimeter of $54$ feet. What is the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared?",
        "inference": "Since the area is $180$ square feet, we know that $length\\times width=180$.\nSince the perimeter is $54$ feet, we know that $2(length+width)=54$.\nWe can solve this for $width$ to get $width=27-length$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get $length\\times(27-length)=180$.\nExpanding and rearranging, we get $length^2-27length+180=0$.\nFactoring, we get $(length-12)(length-15)=0$.\nTherefore, the length is either $12$ feet or $15$ feet.\nSince the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length $length$ and $width$, we have $diagonal^2=length^2+width^2$.\nSubstituting in the two possible values for $length$, we get $diagonal^2=(12)^2+(27-12)^2=144+225=369$ or $diagonal^2=(15)^2+(27-15)^2=225+144=369$.\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is $369$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{369}$.

        "ground_truth": "Set one side of the patio equal to $a$ and the other equal to $b$, producing two equations: \\begin{align*}\nab&=180,\\text{ and}\\\\\n2a+2b&=54.\n\\end{align*}The second equation can be rewritten as $b=27-a$. Substituting, we have \\begin{align*}\n180&=a\\left(27-a\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n180&=27a-a^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n-180&=a^2-27a \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=a^2-27a+180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n0&=\\left(a-12\\right)\\left(a-15\\right).\n\\end{align*}So $12$ feet and $15$ feet are the lengths of the two sides of the patio.
