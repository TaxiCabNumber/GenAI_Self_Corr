At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA population of bacteria is doubling every four hours. At noon there are $600$ bacteria. If this rate continues, how many bacteria will be present at midnight, twelve hours later?",

        "ground_truth": "Twelve hours later is three four-hour intervals later, so the population will double three times. The population size will be $600\\times2\\times2\\times2=600\\times2^3=\\boxed{4800}$ bacteria."
