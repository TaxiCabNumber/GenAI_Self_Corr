        "inference": "Let the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism be $l$, $w$, and $3$, respectively. The surface area of the prism is given by $2lw+2lh+2hw$. Since the surface area of the prism is equal to $52$, we have\n\n$$2lw+2lh+2hw=52\\Rightarrow lw+lh+hw=26\\Rightarrow l(w+h)+h(w+l)=26\\Rightarrow l(w+3)+3(w+l)=26$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $$l(w+3)+3(w+l)=26\\Rightarrow lw+3l+3w+3l=26\\Rightarrow lw+6l+3w=23\\Rightarrow lw+2(3l+3w)=23$$\n\nSince $lw$ is integer, $3l+3w$ must also be integer. Thus, $l$ and $w$ must be factors of $23$. The only pair of factors of $23$ that satisfy the condition $lw+2(3l+3w)=23$ are $l=1$ and $w=23$. Therefore, the volume of the prism is $lwh=1\\cdot23\\cdot3=\\boxed{69}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{69}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $l$ be the length and $w$ be the width of the rectangular prism. Then, the surface area of the prism is given by $$2lw + 2l \\cdot 3 + 2w \\cdot 3 = 2lw + 6l + 6w = 52.$$Dividing through by $2$, we obtain $lw + 3l + 3w = 26$, and using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, it follows that $$lw + 3l + 3w + 9 = (l+3)(w+3) = 35.$$The pairs of (positive) factors of $35$ are given by $\\{1,35\\},\\{5,7\\}$.
