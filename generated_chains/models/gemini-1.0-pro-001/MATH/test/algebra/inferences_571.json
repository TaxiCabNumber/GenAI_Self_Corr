        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)=\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^x\\right\\rfloor$ be a function that is defined for all values of $x$ in $[0,\\infty)$ such that $f(x)$ is a real number. How many distinct values exist in the range of $f(x)$?",
        "inference": "The range of $f(x)$ is the set of all possible values that $f(x)$ can take. Since $f(x)$ is an integer-valued function, its range is a subset of the integers.\n\nFor $x=0$, we have $f(0)=\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^0\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lfloor1\\right\\rfloor=1$.\n\nFor $x>0$, we have $f(x)=\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^x\\right\\rfloor\\le0$. This is because $-\\frac58$ is negative, and raising it to a positive power makes it even more negative. Therefore, $f(x)$ is always less than or equal to $0$ for $x>0$.\n\nThus, the range of $f(x)$ is the set of integers $\\{0,-1,-2,-3,\\ldots\\}$. Since there are infinitely many integers, the range of $f(x)$ has infinitely many distinct values.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\infty}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $-\\frac58$ is a negative number, $f(x)$ is only defined for integer values of $x$, and will alternate between positive and negative values. Additionally, $\\left|-\\frac58\\right|< 1$, so $|f(x)|$ will continually decrease and approach 0 as $x$ increases in the interval $x\\ge0$. Therefore, the largest positive value will occur at $x=0$, giving us the positive upper bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^0\\right\\rfloor=1$. The negative value that is greatest in magnitude then occurs at the next integer value of $x$: $x=1$, giving us the negative lower bound of $\\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac58\\right)^1\\right\\rfloor=-1$. This tells us that $-1 \\le f(x) \\le 1$. Since the $f(x)$ must be an integer, the only possible distinct values contained in the range are -1, 0, and 1. This gives us a total of $\\boxed{3}$ values of $f(x)$ when $x\\ge0$."
