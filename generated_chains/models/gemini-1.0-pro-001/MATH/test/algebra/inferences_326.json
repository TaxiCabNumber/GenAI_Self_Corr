        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $125^b=5$ and $27^b=c$, what is the value of $c$?",
        "inference": "Since $5=125^b$, we have $b=-\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, $c=27^b=27^{-\\frac{1}{3}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{27}}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite the first equation as $(5^3)^b=5^{3\\cdot b}=5\\Rightarrow 3b=1\\Rightarrow b=\\frac{1}{3}$. Plugging in the value of $b$, we get $27^{\\frac{1}{3}}=c$. So, $c=(3^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}=3^{3\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}}=\\boxed{3}$."
