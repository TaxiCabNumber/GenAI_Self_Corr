        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJane has been growing two bacteria farms.\n\nBacteria farm Rod has a starting population of 2 bacteria, while Bacteria farm Sphere has a starting population of 8 bacteria.  However, Jane starts growing Rod five hours before she starts growing Sphere.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Jane checks her farms and finds that they have the exact same population. If the population of Rod doubles every hour, but the population of Sphere is quadrupled every hour, how many hours ago did she start growing Sphere?",
        "inference": "Let \\(t\\) be the number of hours ago Jane started growing Sphere. Then, the population of Rod is \\(2 \\cdot 2^t\\) and the population of Sphere is \\(8 \\cdot 4^t\\). Since both populations are the same at 8 p.m., we have:\n\n$$2 \\cdot 2^t = 8 \\cdot 4^t$$\n\nDividing both sides by 8, we get:\n\n$$2 \\cdot 2^t = 4^t$$\n\nSince \\(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\\), we have:\n\n$$2 \\cdot 2^t = 2^{2t}$$\n\nDividing both sides by \\(2^t\\), we get:\n\n$$2 = 2^t$$\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n$$t = 1$$\n\nTherefore, Jane started growing Sphere 1 hour ago.\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{1}\\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ denote the number of hours Sphere has been growing. We can express this problem as an exponential equation, as follows: $$2^{x+6} = 2\\cdot 4^{x+1}.$$Now, since $4 = 2^2$, we have $2\\cdot 4^{x+1} = 2\\cdot (2^2)^{x+1} = 2\\cdot 2^{2x+2} = 2^{2x + 3}$, which means our equation is: $$2^{x + 6} = 2^{2x + 3}.$$Then, we set the exponents equal to each other, and obtain $$x + 6 = 2x + 3.$$Solving for $x$, we get $\\boxed{x = 3}$."
