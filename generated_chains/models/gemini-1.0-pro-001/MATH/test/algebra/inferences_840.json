        "ground_truth": "Call the price of a pencil $p$ and the price of a jumbo eraser $e$, in terms of cents. We can use the following system of equations to represent the information given: \\begin{align*}\n3p + e &= 124 \\\\\n5p + e &= 182 \\\\\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $2p = 58$, or $p = 29$.
