At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, then what is the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$?",
        "inference": "$f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, so its degree can be any integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. Similarly, $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, so its degree can be any integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.\n\nThe minimum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 0, which occurs when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the zero polynomial. The maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 14, which occurs when both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 7.\n\nTherefore, the product of the minimum and maximum possible degrees of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $0 \\times 14 = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The minimum possible degree is $0$, since we can find polynomials such that $f(x) = -g(x)+c,$ where $c$ is some nonzero constant. This gives us $f(x) + g(x)=c,$ which has degree $0$. Since we are looking for the product of the minimum and the maximum possible degrees, we can easily see that our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$\n\nNote: The maximum possible degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $7,$ since it is impossible for a sum of two polynomials of degree $7$ to include any terms of degree higher than $7.$"
