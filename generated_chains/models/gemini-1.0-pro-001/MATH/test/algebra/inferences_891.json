At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDr. Zaius invests $\\$10,000$ in a CD with an annual interest rate of $4\\%$ that compounds semi-annually (twice a year).  After six months, he rolls over the CD into another CD with an annual interest rate of $5\\%$ that also compounds semi-annually.  After six months in the second CD, how much does Dr. Zaius have, in dollars?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nAfter six months in the first CD, the amount of money Dr. Zaius has is:\n\n$$10,000\\left(1 + \\frac{0.04}{2}\\right)^2 = 10,202$$\n\nAfter six months in the second CD, the amount of money Dr. Zaius has is:\n\n$$10,202\\left(1 + \\frac{0.05}{2}\\right)^2 = 10,404.02$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$10,404.02}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The first CD compounds at a rate of $4/2 = 2$ percent for the first six months, so Dr. Zaius has $10000 \\cdot 1.02 = 10200$ dollars.  The second CD compounds at a rate of $5/2 = 2.5$ percent for the next six months, so Dr. Zaius then has $10200 \\cdot 1.025 = \\boxed{10455}$ dollars."
