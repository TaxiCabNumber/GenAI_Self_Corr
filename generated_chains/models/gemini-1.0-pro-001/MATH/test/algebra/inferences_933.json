At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn the equation $|x-4| -10 = 2$, what is the product of all possible values of $x$?",

Solve for $x$ in each equation.\n$x = 16$ or $x = -8$\n\n4. Find the product of the two possible values of $x$.\n$16 \\times (-8) = -128$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-128}$. I hope it is correct.",
