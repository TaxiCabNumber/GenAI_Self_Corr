        "inference": "**Solution:**\nCompleting the square to get the equation of the circle in standard form:\n$$x^2+6x+9+y^2+8y+16=9+16 \\Rightarrow$$ $$(x+3)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 25.$$ This means that the center of the circle is $(-3,-4)$. Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of the center is $-3 + (-4) = \\boxed{-7}.$\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{-7}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We complete the square for the equation by observing that the given equation is equivalent to \\[\n(x^2+6x+9)+(y^2+8y+16)=25,\n\\] so the equation for the circle becomes \\[\n(x+3)^2 +(y+4)^2 =5^2.\n\\]  Hence, the center is $(-3,-4)$ which implies that the answer is $-3-4 =\\boxed{-7}$."
