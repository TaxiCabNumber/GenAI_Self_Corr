        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo weeks ago, Alice came home from vacation and noticed that a bean plant was growing in her garden. Today, the stalk is $452$ centimeters tall, and Alice observed that its height increases by $5\\%$ every day.  How tall was the plant $2$ weeks ago when she first noticed it growing? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "1. Find the daily growth rate as a decimal: 5% = 0.05\n2. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks: 2 weeks = 14 days\n3. Calculate the growth factor for 14 days: (1 + 0.05)^14 \u2248 1.996\n4. Divide the current height by the growth factor to find the initial height: 452 cm / 1.996 \u2248 226.5 cm\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$226.5$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "One week is equal to $7$ days, and the plant grows by $5\\%$ each day.  We can work backwards to find the previous size of the plant.  We can reverse the compound interest formula to solve this problem, as if the plant loses five percent of its height every day for $14$ days.  So the height of the plant two weeks ago is equal to $$452\\div(1+0.05)^{14}= 452\\div1.98=228.29$$So, the bean plant was $\\boxed{228.3}$ centimeters tall when Alice first found it."
