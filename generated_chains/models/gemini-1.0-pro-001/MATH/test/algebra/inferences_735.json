        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA store carries chocolate, vanilla, peppermint, and lemon candies. One day, the store clerk notices that he has fifteen candies total. Furthermore, the number of peppermint and lemon candies together is twice the number of chocolate and vanilla candies together, and there are eight more peppermint candies than lemon candies. How many lemon candies are there?",
        "inference": "Let x be the number of chocolate candies, y be the number of vanilla candies, z be the number of peppermint candies, and w be the number of lemon candies. We know that x + y + z + w = 15. We also know that z + w = 2 * (x + y). Finally, we know that z = w + 8. Substituting the third equation into the second equation, we get w + 8 + w = 2 * (x + y), which simplifies to 2w + 8 = 2 * (x + y). We can simplify this further to w + 4 = x + y. Substituting this into the first equation, we get x + y + z + w = 15, which becomes x + y + z + (x + y - 4) = 15. Combining like terms, we get 2 * (x + y) + z = 19. Substituting the second equation into this, we get 2 * (x + y) + 2 * (x + y) = 19, which simplifies to 4 * (x + y) = 19. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x + y = 19/4. Substituting this into the equation w + 4 = x + y, we get w + 4 = 19/4. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get w = 19/4 - 4 = 3/4. Therefore, the number of lemon candies is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$\\frac{3}{4}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ denote the number of chocolate candies, $b$ the number of vanilla, $c$ the number of peppermint, and $d$ the number of lemon. We can represent the information given in the problem with the following system of linear equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &= 15 \\\\\n2(a+b) &= c+d \\\\\nc-8 &= d\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $c+d$ in terms of $a+b$ into the first equation gives $3a + 3b = 15$, or $a + b = 5$. This means that $c + d = 10$. The third equation can also be expressed as $c - d = 8$. Adding these two equations gives $2c = 18$, so $c = 9$. Because $d = c - 8$, $d = \\boxed{1}$."
