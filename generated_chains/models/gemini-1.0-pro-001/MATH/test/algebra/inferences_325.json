        "inference": "**Solution:**\nMultiply the first equation by $2$ to get $2d-12c=8$. Subtract $2d-9c=20$ from it to get $3c=-12$. Divide both sides by $3$ to get $c=-4$. Substitute $c=-4$ into the first equation to get $d-6(-4)=4$. Solve for $d$ to get $d=28$. Therefore, $\\frac{d}{c}=\\frac{28}{-4}=\\boxed{-7}.$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{-7}$.

        "ground_truth": "We begin by multiplying the first equation by 2, giving us a system of two equations \\begin{align*} 2d-12c&=8\n\\\\ 2d-9c&=20\n\\end{align*}From here, we can subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(2d-12c)-(2d-9c)=8-20$, which simplifies to $-3c=-12$ or $c=4$. Since we now know the value of $c$, we can plug this back into the first equation to solve for $d$. This gives us $2d-12(4)=8$, or $2d=56$ and $d=28$. Since $d=28$ and $c=4$, $\\frac{d}{c}=\\frac{28}{4}=\\boxed{7}$."
