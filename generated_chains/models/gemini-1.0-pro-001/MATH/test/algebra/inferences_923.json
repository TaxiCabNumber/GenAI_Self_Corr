At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Note that since we can only use positive integers for $x$, the minimum will be x = 1.  Testing x = 2, we get $2^2 + 4\\cdot 2 + 4 = 16$.  Since $3^2 - 2^2 = 5$, we know that only $x = 1,2$ will work, thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ positive integer values of $x$ such that this function is less than 20."
