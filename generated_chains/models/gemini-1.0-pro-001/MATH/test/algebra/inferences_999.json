At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nVanessa will graph the lines $y = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7$ and $y = 2x+5$. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two lines' $x$-intercepts? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "The $x$-intercept of the line $y = \\frac{1}{3}x + 7$ is $x = -21$.\nThe $x$-intercept of the line $y = 2x+5$ is $x = -\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5$.\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates of the two lines' $x$-intercepts is $-21 + (-2.5) = -23.5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-23.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The $x$-intercept occurs where $y=0$.  For the first equation, setting $0 = \\frac{1}{3} x + 7$ yields $x = -21$.  For the second equation, setting $0 = 2x + 5$ yields $x = -2.5$.  Adding these together, our answer is $-21 + -2.5 = \\boxed{-23.5}$."
