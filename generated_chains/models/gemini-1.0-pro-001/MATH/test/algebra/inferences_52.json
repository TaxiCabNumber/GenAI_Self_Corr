At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor the arithmetic sequence $1000, ~987, ~974, ~961, \\ldots ,$ what is the least positive integer in the sequence?",
        "inference": "The first difference is $987-1000 = -13.$ The second difference is $974-987 = -13.$ The sequence is arithmetic because the common difference is constant. To find the least positive integer in the sequence, we need to find the number of terms until the first positive integer. Let $n$ be the number of terms until the first positive integer. Then, the $n$th term is $1000 + (n-1)(-13) = 1133 - 13n.$ This must be greater than or equal to 1. Solving for $n$, we get $n \\leq 86.85.$ Since $n$ must be an integer, the greatest integer less than or equal to $86.85$ is $86.$ Therefore, the least positive integer in the sequence is the $87$th term, which is $1000 + (86-1)(-13) = 1000 - 1127 = \\boxed{-127}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-127}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \\[n < \\frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \\frac{12}{13}.\\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \\cdot 77 = \\boxed{12}$."
