        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe 7th and 8th grades have enrollments of 520 and 650 respectively. The two grades have a total of 18 representatives on the Student Council. How many representatives should the 8th grade have if there is to be a fair representation of the two grades?",
        "inference": "The ratio of the 7th to 8th grade enrollments is 520:650 = 52/65. Therefore, the ratio of the 7th to 8th grade representatives should also be 52:65. Since the total number of representatives is 18, the 7th grade should have (52/117) * 18 = 8 representatives and the 8th grade should have (65/117) * 18 = 10 representatives.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The 8th grade has $\\frac{650}{520+650} = \\frac{650}{1170} = \\frac{65}{117}$ of the total students. To simplify this fraction further, we notice that $65 = 5 \\cdot 13$. Since $117$ is not divisible by $5$, we test if it's divisible by $13$ and find that $117 = 9 \\cdot 13$. Thus to have fair representation, the 8th grade should have $\\frac{65}{117} \\times 18 = \\frac{5}{9} \\times 18 = \\boxed{10}$ of the $18$ representatives."
