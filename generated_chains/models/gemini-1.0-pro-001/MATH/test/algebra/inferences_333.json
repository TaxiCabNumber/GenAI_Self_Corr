At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of a 15-term arithmetic series with first term 7  is $-210$.  What is the common difference?",

We can find the common difference by subtracting the first term from the last term:\n\n$$d = a_{15} - a_1 = -133 - 7 = -140$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-140}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the last term is $7 + (15-1)d = 7+14d$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the series is \\[\\frac{7 + (7 + 14d)}{2} \\cdot 15 = 15(7d + 7) = 105d + 105.\\]We are told that this sum equals $-210$, so we have $105+105d = -210$, from which we find $d=\\boxed{-3}$.\n\nNote: $\\boxed{3}$ is also accepted as an answer."
