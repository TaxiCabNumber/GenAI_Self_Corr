At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)=\\left(\\frac37\\right)^x$ be a function that is defined on the domain $[0,\\infty)$. Find the range of the function.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nSince $0<\\frac37<1$, the function $f(x)$ is decreasing on its domain. Therefore, the range of the function is the interval $\\left[\\frac37,1\\right)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\left[\\frac37,1\\right)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $\\frac37$ is less than 1, the function will always decrease as $x$ increases when $x\\ge0$. So, the largest value in the range will occur when at the smallest value of $x$: $x=0$, giving us the upper bound of $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right)^0=1$. As the value of $x$ increases, the value of $y$ will gradually decrease, approaching (but never reaching) the lower bound of 0. Therefore, the range of this function when $x\\ge0$ is $\\boxed{(0,1]}$"
