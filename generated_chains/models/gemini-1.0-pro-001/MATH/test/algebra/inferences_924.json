At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 - 6x + 13$?",
        "inference": "1. To find the minimum value of a quadratic equation in the form of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we need to determine the vertex of the parabola it represents.\n2. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -6$, so $x = -\\frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3$.\n3. Substituting $x = 3$ back into the equation, we get $y = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 13 = 4$.\n4. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $y$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}$.
