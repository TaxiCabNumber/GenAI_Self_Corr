At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "Call the greater of the two squares $x^2$. Because the squares are consecutive, we can express the smaller square as $(x-1)^2$. We are given that $x^2 - (x-1)^2 = 35$. Expanding yields $x^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 = 35$, or $2x = 36$. Therefore, $x = 18$, so the larger square is $18^2 = \\boxed{324}$."
