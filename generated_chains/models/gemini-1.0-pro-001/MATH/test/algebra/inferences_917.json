        "inference": "Let the three consecutive even numbers be $x, x+2,$ and $x+4$.\nThen, $$x^2+(x+2)^2+(x+4)^2=12296$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2+x^2+4x+4+x^2+8x+16=12296$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3x^2+12x+20=12296$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3x^2+12x-12276=0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x^2+4x-4092=0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow (x+68)(x-60)=0$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=-68, 60$$\nSince the numbers are positive, $x=60$.\nTherefore, the product of the three numbers is $x(x+2)(x+4)=60\\cdot62\\cdot64=243360$.\nSo, the product of the three numbers divided by $8$ is $\\frac{243360}{8}=\\boxed{30420}$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{30420}.

        "ground_truth": "If $n$ is the middle number of the three, the other two numbers are $n-2$ and $n+2$. Therefore, the squares are $n^2-4n+4$, $n^2$, and $n^2+4n+4$. Setting the sum of the three squares equal to $12296$, \\begin{align*}\n\\left(n^2-4n+4\\right)+\\left(n^2\\right)+\\left(n^2+4n+4\\right)&=12296\\\\\n3n^2+8&=12296\\\\\n3n^2&=12288\\\\\nn^2&=4096\\\\\nn&=\\pm64\n\\end{align*}Because $n$ is positive, $n$ must be $64$. Therefore, the set of numbers is $62, 64, 66$. The product of those is $261888$. The product divided by 8 is $\\boxed{32736}$."
