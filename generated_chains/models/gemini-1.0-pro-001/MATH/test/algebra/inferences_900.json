        "ground_truth": "If the coordinates of point $A$ are $(x,y)$ then $x$ and $y$ must satisfy the equations of both lines (as $A$ is on both lines). Substituting the first equation into the second gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x+5y &=11\\\\\n6y+5y&= 11\\\\\n11y&= 11\\\\\ny &= 1.\n\\end{align*}So now $x = 3y = 3$, and so the coordinates of point $A$ are $(3,1)$. The sum of these is $3+1 = \\boxed{4}$."
