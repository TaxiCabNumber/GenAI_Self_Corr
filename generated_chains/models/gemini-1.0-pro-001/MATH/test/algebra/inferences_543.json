Divide the sum by the number of whole numbers from 1 to 250.\nMean = Sum / Number of whole numbers = 31,325 / 250 = 125.3\n\n3. Express the mean as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nMean = 125.3\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{125.3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $1,\\,2,\\,3,\\ldots,250$ is an arithmetic sequence, the mean of all of the terms is equal to the mean of the first and last terms. (To see this, remember that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.)  So the mean is $\\frac{1}{2}(1+250) = \\boxed{125.5}$."
