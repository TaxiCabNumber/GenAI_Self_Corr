        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt each basketball practice last week, Jenny made twice as many free throws as she made at the previous practice.  At her fifth practice she made 48 free throws.  How many free throws did she make at the first practice?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the number of free throws Jenny made at her fourth practice.\nShe made 48 free throws at her fifth practice. Since she made twice as many free throws at each subsequent practice, she must have made 48/2 = 24 free throws at her fourth practice.\n\n**Step 2**: Find the number of free throws Jenny made at her third practice.\nShe made 24 free throws at her fourth practice. Since she made twice as many free throws at each subsequent practice, she must have made 24/2 = 12 free throws at her third practice.\n\n**Step 3**: Find the number of free throws Jenny made at her second practice.\nShe made 12 free throws at her third practice. Since she made twice as many free throws at each subsequent practice, she must have made 12/2 = 6 free throws at her second practice.\n\n**Step 4**: Find the number of free throws Jenny made at her first practice.\nShe made 6 free throws at her second practice. Since she made twice as many free throws at each subsequent practice, she must have made 6/2 = 3 free throws at her first practice.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "At Jenny's fourth practice she made $\\frac{1}{2}(48)=24$ free throws. At her third practice she made 12, at her second practice she made 6, and at her first practice she made $\\boxed{3}$."
