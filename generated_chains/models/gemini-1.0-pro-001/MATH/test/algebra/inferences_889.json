At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 - 6 = 6x + 2 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
        "inference": "In order to determine whether a cookie is snack-sized or lunch-sized, we need to know its radius. The cookie's boundary is defined by the equation x^2+y^2 - 6x + 2y = 6.\n\n1) Complete the square for x and y.\n$$x^2-6x+9+y^2+2y+1=6+9+1$$\n$$(x-3)^2+(y+1)^2=16$$\n\n2) Find the center and the radius.\n$$Center=(h,k)=(3,-1)$$\n$$Radius=r=4$$\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{4}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The equation $x^2+y^2 - 6=6x+2y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-6x+y^2-2y=6$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-3)^2-9+(y-1)^2-1=6$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-3)^2+(y-1)^2=16$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(3,1)$ and radius $\\boxed{4}$."
