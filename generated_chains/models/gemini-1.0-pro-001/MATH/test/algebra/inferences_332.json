        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of two numbers is 12 and their product is 35. What is the positive difference between the numbers?",
        "inference": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.\nThen, $x + y = 12$ and $xy = 35$.\nSquaring the first equation, we get $x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 144$.\nSubstituting $xy = 35$ into this equation, we get $x^2 + 2(35) + y^2 = 144$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $x^2 + y^2 = 74$.\nSubtracting the second equation from this equation, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 39$.\nFactoring this equation, we get $(x - y)^2 = 39$.\nTaking the square root of both sides of this equation, we get $x - y = \\pm \\sqrt{39}$.\nSince the difference between the numbers is positive, we have $x - y = \\sqrt{39}$.\nTherefore, the positive difference between the numbers is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\sqrt{39}$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the two numbers.  We are given  \\begin{align*}\nx+y&=12\\text{, and} \\\\\nxy&=35.\n\\end{align*} Solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second equation, we find $x(12-x)=35$.  Subtracting the left-hand side from both sides of the equation and distributing, we find $0=x^2-12x+35$.  We can factor the right-hand side as $(x-7)(x-5)$, so the solutions are $x=7$ and $x=5$.  Substituting either of these back into $y=12-x$, we find that the two numbers are $7$ and $5$, and their difference is $\\boxed{2}$."
