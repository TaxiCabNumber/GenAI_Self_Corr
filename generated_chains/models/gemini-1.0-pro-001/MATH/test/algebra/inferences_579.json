        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHillary has eleven coins, all dimes and nickels. In total, the coins are worth 75 cents. How many nickels does she have?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) represent the number of dimes. \nThus, there are 11 - \\(x\\) nickels.\nThe value of the dimes is 10 cents each, so the total value of the dimes is 10\\(x\\).\nThe value of the nickels is 5 cents each, so the total value of the nickels is 5(11 - \\(x\\)).\nThe total value of all the coins is 75 cents, so we can write the equation:\n\n\n$$10x+5(11-x)=75$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for x, we get:\n\n\n$$10x+55-5x=75$$\n$$5x=20$$\n$$x=4$$\n\nTherefore, Hillary has 4 dimes. \n\nSince there are 11 coins in total, she has 11 - 4 = 7 nickels.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{7}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of dimes Hillary has be $d$ and the number of nickels she has be $n$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\nd+n&=11\\\\\n10d+5n&=75\n\\end{align*} (The last equation is in terms of cents.) To make the second equation nicer, we divide both sides by 5 to get $2d+n=15$. From the first given equation, we have $d=11-n$. Substituting this into the simplified second given equation to eliminate $d$, we get $2(11-n)+n=15\\Rightarrow n=7$. Thus, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels."
