At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKyle's birthday party in 2007 cost $d$ dollars per person and $p$ people attended. In 2008, the cost per person doubled and the number of people attending the party also doubled. What is the ratio of the total cost of the party in 2007 to the total cost of the party in 2008? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "The cost increased by a factor of 2 due to the increase in cost per person and by an additional factor of 2 due to the increase in number of people.  In total, the cost increased by a factor of 4, so the ratio of the cost of the party in 2007 to the cost of the party in 2008 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
