At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $p(x) = x^2+ax+b$ has distinct roots $2a$ and $b$. Find $a+b$.",
        "inference": "The product of the roots is $p(0) = b$\nThe sum of the roots is $-a$\nSo, $2a \\cdot b = b$ and $2a + b = -a$\nSolving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a = -1$ and $b = -2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use the fact that the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation $x^2+ax+b=0$ are given by $-a$ and $b$, respectively.\n\nIn this problem, we see that $2a+b = -a$ and $(2a)(b) = b$. From the second equation, we see that either $2a = 1$ or else $b = 0$. But if $b = 0$, then the first equation gives $2a = -a$, implying that $a = 0$. This makes the two solutions of our original polynomial the same, and we are given that they are distinct. Hence $b \\not=0$, so $2a = 1,$ or $a = 1/2$. Then $b = -3a = -3/2$, so $a+b = \\boxed{-1}$."
