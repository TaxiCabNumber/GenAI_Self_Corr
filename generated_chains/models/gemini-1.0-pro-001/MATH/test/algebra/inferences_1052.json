At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose a function $f(x)$ has domain $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ and range $[-11,3]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(6x)+1,$$ then what is the range of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe range of $f(x)$ is $[-11,3]$. This means that any value of $f(x)$ must fall between $-11$ and $3$.\n\nNow, let's look at $g(x)$. We have\n\n$$g(x) = f(6x)+1.$$\n\nThis means that the value of $g(x)$ is the value of $f(6x)$ shifted up by 1.\n\nSo, if $f(6x)$ is in the range $[-11,3]$, then $g(x)$ will be in the range $[-10,4]$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{[-10,4]}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First, note that $f(x)$ and $f(6x)$ have the same range, because every value assumed by $f(x)$ (at, say, $x=a$) is also assumed by $f(6x)$ (at $x=\\frac a6$), and vice versa.\n\nSince $g(x)=f(6x)+1$, its range is equal to the range of $f(6x)$ with all values increased by $1$. Thus, the range of $g(x)$ is $[-11+1,3+1] = \\boxed{[-10,4]}$."
