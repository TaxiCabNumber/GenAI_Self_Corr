At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. What is their median?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the first number in the sequence. Then the sequence is $x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+26$. The sum of these numbers is $27x + 351$. Since the sum is $3^7$, we have\n$$27x + 351 = 3^7$$\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{3^7 - 351}{27} = 216$. Therefore, the median of the sequence is $x + 13 = 229$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{229}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The median of a set of consecutive positive integers is equal to the mean of the set of integers.  Therefore, we can find the median by dividing the sum by the number of integers: $3^7/3^3=3^4=\\boxed{81}$."
