At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at a simple interest rate of $5\\%$ per year.  How much money will Frederick have when he can collect the money at the age of $18$?  (Assume no money is added to the account besides the interest.)",
        "inference": "1. Total number of years = 18.\n2. Simple interest = Principal * Rate * Time\n3. Simple interest = 2000 * 0.05 * 18\n4. Simple interest = 2000 * 0.9\n5. Simple interest = 1800\n6. **Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$1800}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the interest is simple, then Frederick's money grows by $\\allowbreak .05(2000)=100$ dollars per year.  This means he gained $18\\times100=\\$1800$, so he has a total of $2000+1800=\\boxed{\\$3800}$."
