At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe second and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 2 and 30, respectively. What is the fiftieth term?",
        "inference": "Let \\( a_n \\) be the \\( n \\)-th term of the arithmetic sequence.\nThen, the second term \\( a_2 = 2 \\) and the ninth term \\( a_9 = 30 \\).\nThe common difference is\n$$d = a_9 - a_2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \\tag 1$$\n\nThe \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula\n$$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \\tag 2$$\n\nWe are given that \\( a_2 = 2 \\) and \\( d = 28 \\). Substituting these values into (2), we get\n$$a_n = 2 + (n-1)28 = 2 + 28n - 28 = 28n - 26$$\n\nThe 50th term is\n$$a_{50} = 28(50) - 26 = 1400 - 26 = \\boxed{1374}$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$1374$}.

        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the first term, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $n^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + (n - 1)d$.  In particular, the second term is $a + d = 2$, and the ninth term is $a + 8d = 30$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $7d = 28$, so $d = 4$.  Substituting this into the equation $a + d = 2$, we get $a + 4 = 2$, so $a = -2$.\n\nThen the fiftieth term is $a + 49d = -2 + 49 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{194}$."
