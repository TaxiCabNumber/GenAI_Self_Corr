At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe amount of money a certain company makes can be represented by the graph $y=x^2-8x-33$, where $x$ is the quantity produced. What is the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit?",
        "inference": "To break even or make a profit, the company must make a non-negative amount of money. This means that the value of $y$ must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\n$$y=x^2-8x-33\\ge0$$\n\nWe can solve this inequality by factoring the quadratic expression:\n\n$$(x-11)(x+3)\\ge0$$\n\nThis inequality is true when $x-11\\ge0$ and $x+3\\ge0$, or when $x-11\\le0$ and $x+3\\le0$.\n\nSolving each of these inequalities, we get:\n\n$$x\\ge11\\quad\\text{or}\\quad x\\le-3$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest quantity at which the company can produce to break even or make a profit is $\\boxed{11}$.\nFinal Answer: \\\\boxed{$11$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we factor $x^2-8x-33$ into $(x-11)(x+3)$. So, $y=0$ at $x=-3$ or $x=11$. The quantity produced must be a positive amount, so that means the company breaks even (making no money) at $x=\\boxed{11}$ and begins to make a profit after that point ($y>0$)."
