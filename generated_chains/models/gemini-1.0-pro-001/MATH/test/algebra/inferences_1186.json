At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the $x$-coordinates of the vertices of a triangle in the Cartesian plane equals $\\sqrt{13}$.  Let $S$ equal the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. Find $S^2$.",
        "inference": "The midpoint of the side formed by vertices $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$. So, the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle are $(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$, $(\\frac{x_2+x_3}{2},\\frac{y_2+y_3}{2})$, and $(\\frac{x_3+x_1}{2},\\frac{y_3+y_1}{2})$. The sum of the $x$-coordinates of these midpoints is $S=\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}+\\frac{x_2+x_3}{2}+\\frac{x_3+x_1}{2}=x_1+x_2+x_3=\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nTherefore, $S^2=(\\sqrt{13})^2=\\boxed{13}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let the $x$-coordinates of the vertices be $a,b,c$.  Then the $x$-coordinates of the midpoints of the sides are $\\frac{a+b}2,\\frac{a+c}2,\\frac{b+c}2$.  The sum of these equals $\\frac{2a+2b+2c}2=a+b+c$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\left(\\sqrt{13}\\right)^2=\\boxed{13}$."
