        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn amusement park charges an entry fee of $\\$2.25$ plus $\\$1.50$ for each ride. If Simon spent a total of $\\$12.75$, how many rides did he pay for?",
        "inference": "1. Let's represent the number of rides Simon paid for as $r$.\n2. The total cost of Simon's visit is the entry fee plus the cost of the rides: $2.25 + 1.50r$.\n3. Since Simon spent \\$12.75, we can set up the equation: $2.25 + 1.50r = 12.75$.\n4. To solve for $r$, we subtract $2.25$ from both sides of the equation: $1.50r = 10.50$.\n5. Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by $1.50$ to isolate $r$: $r = 7$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of rides for which Simon paid. Then $12.75=2.25+1.50x\\implies 1.50x=10.50\\implies x=\\boxed{7}$."
