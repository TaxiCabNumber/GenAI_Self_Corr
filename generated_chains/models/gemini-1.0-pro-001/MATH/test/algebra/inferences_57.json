At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI choose a random integer $n$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive. What is the probability that for the $n$ I chose, there exist no real solutions to the equation $x(x+5) = -n$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe equation $x(x+5) = -n$ is a quadratic equation of the form $x^2+5x+n=0$. **If** the discriminant of this equation is negative, then there are no real solutions to the equation. The discriminant of the equation is $5^2-4(1)(n) = 25-4n$. So, we need to find the values of $n$ for which $25-4n<0$. Solving this inequality gives $n>\\frac{25}{4}=6.25$. Since $n$ is an integer between $1$ and $10$ inclusive, the only value of $n$ that satisfies this inequality is $n=\\boxed{7}$. **Therefore, the probability that there are no real solutions to the equation $x(x+5)=-n$ is $\\frac{1}{10}$.**\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$\\frac{1}{10}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$."
