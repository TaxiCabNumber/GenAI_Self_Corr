At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOhm's law states that $V=IR$ for a simple circuit, where $V$ is the total voltage, $I$ is the amount of current running through the resistor and $R$ is the resistance of the resistor. If $I=40$ amperes when $R=3$ ohms, find the amount of current (in amperes) when the resistor has a resistance of $20$ ohms. Assume voltage remains constant.",
