At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nYou have two circles, one with radius $r$ and the other with radius $R$. You wish for the difference in the areas of these two circles to be less than or equal to 5$\\pi$. If $r+R=10$, what is the maximum difference in the lengths of the radii?",
        "inference": "The area of the circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2$.\n\nThe area of the circle with radius $R$ is $\\pi R^2$.\n\nThe difference in the areas of the two circles is $\\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi(R^2 - r^2)$.\n\nWe want the difference in the areas of the two circles to be less than or equal to $5\\pi$.  So, we have $\\pi(R^2 - r^2) \\leq 5\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\pi$, we get $R^2 - r^2 \\leq 5$.  Factoring the left-hand side, we get $(R - r)(R + r) \\leq 5$.\n\nWe know that $r + R = 10$, so $R = 10 - r$.  Substituting this into the inequality, we get $(10 - r - r)(10 - r + r) \\leq 5$.  Simplifying, we get $100 - 20r \\leq 5$.  Subtracting $100$ from both sides, we get $-20r \\leq -95$.  Dividing both sides by $-20$, we get $r \\geq 4.75$.\n\nSo, the minimum value of $r$ is $r = 4.75$.  The maximum difference in the lengths of the radii is $R - r = 10 - 4.75 = 5.25$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5.25}. I hope it is correct.",
