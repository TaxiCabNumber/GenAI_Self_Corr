        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive runners together complete a $100$-mile endurance race by running separate, non-overlapping portions of the course.  Runner B's portion is $1.5$ times the length of Runner A's portion.  The combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B.  Runner E then runs the last $10$ miles of the race.  How many miles did Runner B run?",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the length of Runner A's portion.\n\nRunner B's portion is $1.5a$.\n\nThe combined portion for Runners C and D is $2(a+1.5a)=5.0a$.\n\nThe combined portion for Runners A and B is $a+1.5a=2.5a$.\n\nRunner E runs $10$ miles.\n\nSo, the total distance is $a+1.5a+5.0a+2.5a+10=10.0a+10=100$.\n\nSolving for $a$, we get $a=9$.\n\nTherefore, Runner B's portion is $1.5a=\\boxed{13.5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{13.5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the lengths of the portions for runners $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ be $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$, respectively. From the problem conditions, we have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d+e&=100\\\\\nb&=1.5a\\\\\nc+d&=2(a+b)\\\\\ne&=10\n\\end{align*} Plugging in the value of $e$ into the first equation, we have $a+b+c+d=90$. Substituting the third original equation into this last equation, we have $a+b+2(a+b)=90\\Rightarrow a+b=30$. From the second original equation, we have $b=1.5a\\Rightarrow a=\\frac{2}{3}b$. Substituting this last equation into the equation $a+b=30$ to eliminate $a$, we have $\\frac{2}{3}b+b=30$, so $b=18$. Thus, Runner $B$ ran $\\boxed{18}$ miles."
