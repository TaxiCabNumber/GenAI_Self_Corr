I hope it is correct.'\nLine $l$ has equation $y = 4x - 7$, and line $m$ with equation $y = ax + b$ is perpendicular to line $l$ at $(2,1)$. What is the $y$-coordinate of the point on $m$ that has $x$-coordinate 6?",
        "inference": "Since lines $l$ and $m$ are perpendicular, the slope of $m$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $l$, which is $4$. Therefore, the slope of $m$ is $-\\frac{1}{4}$.\nSince $m$ passes through $(2,1)$, we can use the point-slope form of a line to write its equation:\n$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$\n\nwhere $(x_1,y_1)$ is the given point and $m$ is the slope. Substituting the given values, we get:\n$$y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x - 2)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nTo find the $y$-coordinate of the point on $m$ that has $x$-coordinate 6, we simply substitute $x=6$ into the equation of $m$:\n$$y = -\\frac{1}{4}(6) + \\frac{1}{2} = -1.5 + 0.5 = -1$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We find the equation of $m$ first. Since it is perpendicular to $l$, its slope must be $-1\\times(4)^{-1}$. Thus $a = -1/4$. Since $m$ also passes through the point $(2,1)$, we can find the equation of line $m$ by substituting 2 for $x$ and $1$ for $y$ in $m$'s point-slope form: $1 = 2\\times-\\frac{1}{4} + t$, where $(0,t)$ is the $y$-intercept of $m$. $t = \\frac{3}{2}$. Thus, at $x = 6$, the equation of line $m$ has y value $-6\\times\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\boxed{0}$."
