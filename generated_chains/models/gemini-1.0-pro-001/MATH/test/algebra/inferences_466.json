At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf a recipe for a two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour, how many cups are needed for 2 five-pound cakes?",
        "inference": "A two-pound cake requires 1.5 cups of flour.\nSo, a five-pound cake requires 1.5 * 5 = 7.5 cups of flour.\nTwo five-pound cakes require 7.5 *2 = 15 cups of flour.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$15$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We first find that $2$ five-pound cakes results in $2 \\times 5 = 10$ pounds of cake total. Since a two-pound cake requires $1.5$ cups of flour, a ten pounds of cake will require five times as much flour (since $10/2=5$). Five times $1.5$ cups of flour is $\\boxed{7.5}$ pounds of flour."
