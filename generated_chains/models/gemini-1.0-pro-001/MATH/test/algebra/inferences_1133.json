At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a recent wedding, the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age. If the sum of their ages was 51 years, how old was the groom?",
        "inference": "Let x be the bride's age.\nGroom's age = (1/2 * x) + 15\nSum of their ages = x + [(1/2 * x) + 15] = 51\n=> x + (1/2 * x) + 15 = 51\n=> (3/2) * x = 51 - 15\n=> (3/2) * x = 36\n=> x = 36 * (2/3)\n=> x = 24\n\nGroom's age = (1/2 * x) + 15 = (1/2 * 24) + 15 = 39\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{39}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let the groom's age be $g$ and the bride's age be $b$. We are trying to find the value of $g$. We can write a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: \\begin{align*}\ng &= \\frac{1}{2}b + 15 \\\\\ng + b &= 51.\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the statement ``the groom's age was fifteen years more than half the bride's age.'' The second equation represents the statement ``if the sum of their ages was 51 years...'' We are solving for $g$, so we want to eliminate $b$. From the second equation, we get that $b=51-g$. Substituting that into the first equation to get rid of $b$, we have $g=\\frac{1}{2}(51-g)+15$, from which we get that $g=27$. Thus, the groom's age is $\\boxed{27}$ years old."
