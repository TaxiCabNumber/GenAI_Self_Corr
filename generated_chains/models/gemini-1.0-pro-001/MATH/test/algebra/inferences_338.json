        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJosh and Mike live 13 miles apart. Yesterday Josh started to ride his bicycle toward Mike's house. A little later Mike started to ride his bicycle toward Josh's house. When they met, Josh had ridden for twice the length of time as Mike and at four-fifths of Mike's rate. How many miles had  Mike ridden when they met?",
        "inference": "Let m be the number of miles Mike rode.\nMike rode for 1/2 the time as Josh, so Josh rode for 2/2 = 1 hour.\nMike rode at 5/4 the rate of Josh, so Josh's rate was 4/5 of Mike's rate.\nTherefore, Josh rode at 4/5 * m/h miles per hour.\nSince Josh rode for 1 hour, he rode 4/5 * m miles.\nSince Josh and Mike rode 13 miles in total, we have \n$$4/5 * m + m = 13$$\n$$9/5 * m = 13$$\n$$m = 13 * 5/9$$\n$$m = 7.222...$$\n$$m = 7.22$$\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{7.22}$. I hope that is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because $\\text{(rate)(time)} = \\text{(distance)}$, the distance Josh rode was $(4/5)(2) = 8/5$ of the distance that Mike rode.  Let $m$ be the number of miles that Mike had ridden when they met. Then the number of miles between their houses is \\[\n13 = m + \\frac{8}{5}m = \\frac{13}{5}m.\n\\]Thus $m = \\boxed{5}$."
