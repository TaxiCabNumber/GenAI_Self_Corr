At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRaymond normally has a snack consisting of ten 12-calorie crackers. How many 20-calorie cookies would he have to eat to consume the same number of calories?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Calculate the total calories in 10 crackers.**\n10 crackers x 12 calories/cracker = 120 calories\n\n**Step 2: Divide the number of calories in 10 crackers by the calories per cookie to find the number of cookies needed to consume the same number of calories.**\n120 calories / 20 calories/cookie = 6 cookies\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Raymond consumes a total of $10\\cdot12=120$ calories at snack. If he eats $c$ cookies, he would get $20c$ calories, so since he needs this to equal 120, he must eat $c=120/20=\\boxed{6}$ cookies."
