        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt Central Middle School the $108$ students who take the AMC 8 meet in the evening to talk about problems and eat an average of two cookies apiece. Walter and Gretel are baking Bonnie's Best Bar Cookies this year. Their recipe, which makes a pan of $15$ cookies, list these items:\n\n$\\bullet$ $1\\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour\n\n$\\bullet$ $2$ eggs\n\n$\\bullet$ $3$ tablespoons butter\n\n$\\bullet$ $\\frac{3}{4}$ cups sugar\n\n$\\bullet$ $1$ package of chocolate drops.\n\nThey will make only full recipes, no partial recipes.\n\nWalter and Gretel must make enough pans of cookies to supply $216$ cookies. There are $8$ tablespoons in a stick of butter. How many sticks of butter will be needed? (Some butter may be left over, of course.)",
        "inference": "To make 1 pan of cookies, 3 tablespoons of butter are needed. \n\nTo make 216 cookies, Walter and Gretel will need 216/15 = 14.4 pans of cookies.\n\nSince they can only make full recipes, they will need to make 15 pans of cookies.\n\n15 pans of cookies will require 15 * 3 = 45 tablespoons of butter.\n\nThere are 8 tablespoons in a stick of butter, so they will need 45/8 = 5.625 sticks of butter.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $216\\div 15=14.4,$ they will have to bake $15$ recipes. This requires $15\\times 3=45$ tablespoons of butter. So, $45\\div\n8=5.625,$ and $\\boxed{6}$ sticks are needed."
