Since $P(a,b,c)$ has degree 3 and is divisible by three linear terms, $P(a,b,c)$ must factor as $k(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ where $k$ is a constant. Hence, $P(a,b,c) = 0$ if and only if at least two of $a,b,c$ are equal.\n\nTo count how many triples $(a,b,c)$ satisfy this, we count the complement. There are $6\\cdot5\\cdot4 = 120$ triples where $a,b,c$ are all distinct, and $6\\cdot6\\cdot6=216$ triples total, so there are $216-120 = \\boxed{96}$ triples such that $P(a,b,c) = 0$."
