At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the roots of the quadratic equation $\\frac12x^2+99x+c=0$ are $x=-99+\\sqrt{8001}$ and $x=-99-\\sqrt{8001}$, then what is the value of $c$?",
        "inference": "Since the roots of the quadratic equation are $x=-99+\\sqrt{8001}$ and $x=-99-\\sqrt{8001}$, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n\nVieta's formulas state that:\n\n$$sum\\space of\\space roots=-b/a$$\n\n$$product\\space of\\space roots=c/a$$\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we have:\n\n$$-99+\\sqrt{8001}+(-99-\\sqrt{8001})=-198=-b/a$$\n\n$$(-99+\\sqrt{8001})(-99-\\sqrt{8001})=9801=c/a$$\n\nSolving the first equation for $a$, we get:\n\n$$a=-b/198$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $a$ into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$9801=-bc/198$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-198$, we get:\n\n$$c=19800$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{19800}$.

        "ground_truth": "By the quadratic formula, the roots of the equation are $$x=\\frac{-(99)\\pm\\sqrt{(99)^2-4(\\frac12)c}}{2(\\frac12)},$$which simplifies to $$x=-99\\pm\\sqrt{9801-2c}.$$This looks like our target, except that we have to get the $9801-2c$ under the radical to equal $8001$. So, we solve the equation $9801-2c=8001$, which yields $c=\\boxed{900}$."
