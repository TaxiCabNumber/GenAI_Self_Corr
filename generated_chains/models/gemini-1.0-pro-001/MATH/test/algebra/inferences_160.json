        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDaniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a television (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 15 customers buy a television that costs $\\$$1500, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500?",
        "inference": "Let y be the number of customers who would buy a television that costs $2500. Since the popularity of a television is inversely proportional to its cost, we can write:\n\ny * 2500 = 15 * 1500\ny = 15 * 1500 / 2500\ny = 9\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the popularity of a television (or the number of customers who buy one) equal $p$, and let the cost of the television equal $c$. According to Daniel's theory, $p$ and $c$ are inversely proportional. Thus, $(p)(c)=k$ for some constant value $k$. If $p=15$ when $c=1500$, then $k=(15)(1500)=22500$. So when $c=2500$, \\begin{align*} (p)(c)&=k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (p)(2500)&=22500\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad p&=\\frac{22500}{2500}\n\\\\ &=\\boxed{9}.\n\\end{align*}According to Daniel's theory, 9 customers would buy the $\\$2500$ television."
