        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRobert wants to fence a rectangular plot of land of at least 500 square feet while using the least amount of fencing possible. He wants the width of the plot to be 5 ft longer than the length. What is the width of the plot?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the length of the plot. The width of the plot is $x+5$. The area of the plot is $A=x(x+5)=x^2+5x$. We want to find the minimum value of $x$ such that $A\\ge 500$.\n\nSolving the inequality $A\\ge 500$, we get\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nx^2+5x&\\ge 500\\\\\nx^2+5x-500&\\ge 0\\\\\n(x+25)(x-20)&\\ge 0\\\\\nx\\le -25 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x\\ge 20.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $x$ represents the length of the plot, which must be positive, we have $x\\ge 20$. Therefore, the minimum value of $x$ is $20$.\n\nThe width of the plot is $x+5=20+5=\\boxed{25}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{25}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We set the length to be $l$ and the width to $l+5$. We can write the problem as the inequality $l(l+5)\\ge500$. Distributing on the left-hand side, subtracting 500 from both sides, and factoring, we get \\begin{align*}\nl(l+5)&\\ge500 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\nl^2+5l-500&\\ge 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\\\n(l+25)(l-20)&\\ge 0.\n\\end{align*}The area is at least 500 square feet when the $l \\le -25 \\text{ or } l \\ge 20$. The dimensions can't be negative, so the smallest length possible while still having an area of at least 500 square ft is $20$ ft. Therefore, the width of the plot is $20+5=\\boxed{25 \\text{ ft}}$."
