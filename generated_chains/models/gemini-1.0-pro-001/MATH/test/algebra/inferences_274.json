At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:** Solving the given equation gives,\n$$\\frac{3x+x^2}{3x}=b; \\qquad 3x+x^2=3bx$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow\\qquad x^2-(3b-3)x=0$$\n\nFor exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero,\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{b=1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Multiplying both sides by $3x$ gives $9 + x^2 = 3bx$, so $x^2 -3bx +9=0$. The equation has exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant of $x^2 -3bx + 9$ is 0.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-3b)^2 -4(9) = 9b^2 - 36$.  Setting this equal to 0 gives $9b^2 = 36$, so $b^2=4$.  The positive solution to this equation is $b=\\boxed{2}$."
