At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBen is climbing a tree with a lot of branches. His height off the ground at time $t$ is $2t^2-5t+29$ feet. To the nearest foot, what will his minimum height be?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\nLet \\(f(t)=2t^2-5t+29\\). To find the minimum, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is \\(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\), so in this case, \\(-\\frac{-5}{2(2)}=\\frac{5}{4}\\). Plugging this value into the function, we get \\(f\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)=2\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^2-5\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)+29=\\frac{169}{8}\\).
