At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJill is trying to solve the following quadratic equation by completing the square: $$x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0.$$She rewrites this equation in the form of $(ax + b)^2 + c,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are integers. What is $ab$?",
