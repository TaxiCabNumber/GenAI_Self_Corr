        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a certain species of ocean fish, 8 fish can exist per cubic meter of water without the symptoms of overcrowding. If doctors want to study 600 fish, what is the minimum number of cubic meters of water necessary to maintain a healthy study environment?",
        "inference": "1. Determine the number of cubic meters of water needed for 1 fish: $1/8$ cubic meters.\n2. Multiply the number of cubic meters needed for 1 fish by the number of fish: $1/8 * 600 = 75$ cubic meters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{75}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We need 8 fish per cubic meter.  We have 600 fish, so we have $600/8 = 75$ groups of 8 fish, which means we need $\\boxed{75}$ cubic meters of water."
