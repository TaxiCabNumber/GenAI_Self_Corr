        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose that $f$ is a quadratic polynomial and $g$ is a cubic polynomial, and both $f$ and $g$ have a leading coefficient of $1$. What is the maximum degree of the polynomial $(f(x))^3 - (g(x))^2 + f(x) - 1$?",
        "inference": "$$ \\text{Degree of } (f(x))^3 = 3\\cdot \\text{Degree of }f(x)=3\\cdot 2=6 $$\n$$ \\text{Degree of }(g(x))^2=2\\cdot \\text{Degree of }g(x)=2\\cdot3=6 $$\n$$ \\text{Degree of }f(x)=2 $$\n$$ \\text{Degree of }-1=0 $$\n$$ \\text{Degree of }6-6+2+0=2 $$\nFinal Answer: $ \\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since $f$ has a degree of $2$, the degree of $(f(x))^3$ is $6$. Also, since $g$ has a degree of $3$, the degree of $(g(x))^2$ is $6$. Furthermore, as $f$ and $g$ both have a leading coefficient of $1$, then $(f(x))^3$ and $(g(x))^2$ both have a leading coefficient of $1$. Hence, when subtracting $(f(x))^3 - (g(x))^2$, the leading terms cancel, and so $(f(x))^3 - (g(x))^2$ has a maximum degree of $5$. We can see that a degree of $\\boxed{5}$ can be achieved by taking $f(x) = x^2 + x$ and $g(x) = x^3$, for example."
