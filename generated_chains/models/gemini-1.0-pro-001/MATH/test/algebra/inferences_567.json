At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $60$ miles per hour is $88$ feet per second, how many feet per second is $66$ miles per hour? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nFirst, convert 60 miles per hour to feet per second:\n\n60 miles per hour = 60 * 5280 feet per hour = 316,800 feet per hour\n\nNow, divide 316,800 feet per hour by 3600 seconds per hour to get feet per second:\n\n316,800 feet per hour / 3600 seconds per hour = 88 feet per second\n\nFinally, use the proportion 60 miles per hour : 88 feet per second = 66 miles per hour : x feet per second to find x:\n\nx = (66 miles per hour * 88 feet per second) / 60 miles per hour = 96.8 feet per second\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$96.8$}.

        "ground_truth": "We have $60 \\text{ miles per hour} = 88 \\text{ feet per second}$. Multiplying both sides by $66/60$, we have $66 \\text{ miles per hour} = \\frac{66}{60} \\cdot 88 \\text{ feet per second} = \\boxed{96.8} \\text{ feet per second}$."
