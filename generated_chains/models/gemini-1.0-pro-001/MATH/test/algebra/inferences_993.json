At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive integers be \\(x\\) and \\(x + 1\\). Then their product is \\(x(x + 1) = x^2 + x\\).\n\nThe smallest positive four-digit integer is 1000. So we need to find the smallest positive integer \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 + x \\ge 1000\\).\n\nSolving this inequality, we get \\(x^2 + x - 1000 \\ge 0\\).\n\nFactoring the left-hand side, we get \\((x - 25)(x + 40) \\ge 0\\).\n\nSince \\(x\\) is positive, we have \\(x \\ge 25\\). So the smallest positive integer that satisfies the inequality is \\(x = 25\\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit integer that is the product of two consecutive integers is \\(25 \\times 26 = 650\\).\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{650}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look for the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n(n+1)$ is greater than 999.  We expect this value of $n$ to be near $\\sqrt{1000}$, which is between 31 and 32. Trying $n=31$, we find that $31(32)=992$. Adding 1 gives us $n=32$ and $32(33)=\\boxed{1056}$."
