I hope it is correct.'\nWhen a car's brakes are applied, it travels 5 feet less in each  second than the previous second until it comes to a complete stop.  A car goes 45 feet in the first second after the brakes are applied.  How many feet does the car travel from the time the  brakes are applied to the time the car stops?",
        "inference": "The car goes 45 feet in the first second, 40 feet in the second second, 35 feet in the third second, and so on. \n\nThis is an arithmetic series with a first term of 45 and a common difference of -5. \n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n\n$$S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$$\n\nwhere \n* $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, \n* $a_1$ is the first term, \n* $a_n$ is the nth term, and \n* $n$ is the number of terms. \n\nLet's find the number of terms in this series. \n\nSince the car travels 5 feet less in each second than the previous second, the nth term will be:\n\n$$a_n = a_1 - 5(n-1)$$\n\n$$a_n = 45 - 5(n-1)$$\n\nWhen the car stops, the nth term will be 0. So we can solve for n:\n\n$$0 = 45 - 5(n-1)$$\n\n$$5(n-1) = 45$$\n\n$$n-1 = 9$$\n\n$$n = 10$$\n\nSo the car travels for 10 seconds. \n\nNow we can find the sum of the first 10 terms:\n\n$$S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} (45 + 0)$$\n\n$$S_{10} = 225$$\n\nTherefore, the car travels 225 feet from the time the brakes are applied to the time the car stops.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$225$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of feet the car travels in each second is an arithmetic sequence with first term 45 and common difference $-5$.  We are summing all the positive terms in this sequence (these terms represent the number of feet the car travels in each second). Thus, we want to find the sum $45+40+\\dots+5$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.  The number of terms is $45/5 = 9$, so the sum is $(45 + 5)/2 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{225}$."
