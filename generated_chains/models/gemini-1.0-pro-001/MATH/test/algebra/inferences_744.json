        "ground_truth": "In the equation $\\frac{12\\star2}{9*3}=4$, the numerator of the fraction in the left hand side must be quadruple the denominator. By trial and error, the only way this works is if the $\\star$ operation is multiplication and the $*$ operation is subtraction, in which case the equation becomes $\\frac{12\\cdot2}{9-3}=\\frac{24}{6}=4$.
