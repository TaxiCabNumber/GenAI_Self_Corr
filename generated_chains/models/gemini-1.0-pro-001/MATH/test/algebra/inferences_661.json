        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe know that $x$ is positive and $x\\cdot\\lfloor x\\rfloor=27$, we can write it as $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=\\frac{27}{x}$. Since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the largest integer less than or equal to $x$, we have $x-1\\le\\lfloor x\\rfloor$. Thus, $x-1\\le\\frac{27}{x}$, or $x^2-x-27\\le0$. Factoring the quadratic, we have $x=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{109}}{2}$. Since $x$ is positive, we take the positive root. So, $x=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{109}}{2}\\approx5.83$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{5.83}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor \\leq x < \\lfloor x\\rfloor + 1$. This implies that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 \\leq x\\cdot\\lfloor x\\rfloor < \\left(\\lfloor x\\rfloor + 1\\right)^2$ for all values of $x$. In particular since $x\\cdot\\lfloor x\\rfloor=27$ and $5^2<27<6^2$, we can conclude that $5<x<6\\rightarrow\\lfloor x\\rfloor=5$. From there, all we have to do is divide to get that $x=\\frac{27}{5}=\\boxed{5.4}$."
