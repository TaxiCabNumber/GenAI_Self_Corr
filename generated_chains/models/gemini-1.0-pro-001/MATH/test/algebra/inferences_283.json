        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of three numbers $a, b$ and $c$ is 88. If we decrease $a$ by 5, we get $N$. If we increase $b$ by 5, we get $N$. If we multiply $c$ by 5, we get $N$. What is the value of $N$?",
