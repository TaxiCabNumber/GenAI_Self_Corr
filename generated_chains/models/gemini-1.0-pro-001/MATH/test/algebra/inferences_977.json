At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nEric's sports car's specifications include a $500$ metric horsepower engine. Eric wants to know how many kilowatts of power his car's engine can generate. What result should Eric obtain if $1$ kilowatt is equivalent to $1.36$ horsepower? (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest kilowatt.)",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the horsepower to kilowatts by multiplying the horsepower by the conversion factor. $$500 \\text{ horsepower} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ kilowatt}}{1.36 \\text{ horsepower}} = 367.65 \\text{ kilowatts}$$\n\n**Step 2:** Round the result to the nearest kilowatt $$367.65 \\text{ kilowatts} \\approx 368 \\text{ kilowatts}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{368}\\). I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We multiply the engine's power measured in horsepower, $500$, by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{kW}}{1.36\\ \\text{hp}}$ to obtain $500\\ \\text{hp} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kW}}{1.36\\ \\text{hp}} \\approx \\boxed{368}\\ \\text{kW}$."
