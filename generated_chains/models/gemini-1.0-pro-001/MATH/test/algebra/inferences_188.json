At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?",
        "inference": "The height of the ball is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$. The time at which the height is at its maximum can be found by finding the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -25$ and $b = 75$, so the time at which the height is at its maximum is:\n\n$$t = -\\frac{75}{2(-25)} = \\frac{3}{2}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{t = 1.5}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, we find the maximum height of the ball by maximizing the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-25$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-25t^2+75t+24=-25(t^2-3t)+24\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $\\left( -\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=\\frac{9}{4}$ inside the parentheses to get \\begin{align*}\n-25(t^2-3t)+24&=-25\\left(t^2-3t+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)+24\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{225}{4}+\\frac{96}{4}\\\\\n&=-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{321}{4}\n\\end{align*}Since $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-25\\left(t-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2=0$.
