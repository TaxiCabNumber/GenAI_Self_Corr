At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $y = -16t^2 - 60t + 54$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown downward at 60 feet per second from a height of 54 feet from the ground, where $t$ represents time, measured in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
