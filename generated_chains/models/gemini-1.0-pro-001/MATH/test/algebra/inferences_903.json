I hope it is correct.'\nWhen Lauren was born on January 1, 1990, her grandparents put $\\$1000$ in a savings account in her name. The account earned $7.5\\%$ annual interest compounded quarterly every three months. To the nearest dollar, how much money was in her account when she turned two?",

Calculate the interest rate per quarter:\n$$7.5\\%\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=1.875\\%=0.01875$$\n3. Use the compound interest formula to calculate the amount of money in the account:\n$$A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$$\nwhere:\n- $A$ is the final amount in the account\n- $P$ is the principal (initial amount)\n- $r$ is the annual interest rate (7.5%)\n- $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year (4)\n- $t$ is the number of years (2)\n$$A=1000\\left(1+\\frac{0.075}{4}\\right)^{4\\cdot2}=1000\\left(1.01875\\right)^8=1165.76$$\n4.

        "ground_truth": "The annual interest rate is 7.5 percent, so each quarter, the investment is compounded at the rate of $7.5/4 = 1.875$ percent.  In two years, there are eight quarters, so the investment will have grown to $1000 \\cdot 1.01875^8 = \\boxed{1160}$, to the nearest dollar."
