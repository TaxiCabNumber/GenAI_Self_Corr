Both of these points must lie on the parabola, so we plug them into the equation for the parabola to get the equations \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x^2-5x-3,\\\\\n-y&=3(-x)^2-5(-x)-3 \\Rightarrow y=-3x^2-5x+3.\n\\end{align*} Substituting the first equation into the second to eliminate $y$, we have $3x^2-5x-3=-3x^2-5x+3$, or $6x^2=6\\Rightarrow x^2=1$. So $x=1$ (the negative alternative for $x$ gives the same answer) and $y=3(1)^2-5(1)-3=-5$. Thus, point $A$ is at $(1,-5)$ and point $B$ is at $(-1,5)$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$ is then $\\sqrt{(-1-1)^2+(5-(-5))^2}=\\sqrt{104}$. Hence, $AB^2=\\boxed{104}$."
