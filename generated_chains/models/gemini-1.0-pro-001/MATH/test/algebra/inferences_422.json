At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRichard is building a rectangular playground from 200 feet of fencing. The fencing must entirely enclose the playground. What is the maximum area of this playground?",
        "inference": "Let x be the length of one side and y be the length of the other side of the playground. Then, the perimeter of the playground is 2x + 2y = 200. Since x and y must be positive, we have x = 100 - y.\n\nThe area of the playground is A = xy = (100 - y)y = 100y - y^2.\n\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of A with respect to y and set it equal to 0:\n\ndA/dy = 100 - 2y = 0\n\nSolving for y, we get y = 50.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the playground is A = (100 - 50)50 = \\boxed{2500} square feet.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$2500$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the length of the playground be $l$ and the width be $w$. We have the equation $2l+2w=200 \\Rightarrow l + w = 100$. We want to maximize the area of this rectangular playground, which is given by $lw$. From our equation, we know that $l=100-w$. Substituting this in to our expression for area, we have \\[(100-w)(w)=100w-w^2\\]We will now complete the square to find the maximum value of this expression. Factoring a $-1$ out, we have \\[-(w^2-100w)\\]In order for the expression inside the parenthesis to be a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(100/2)^2=2500$ inside the parenthesis. Doing this, we get \\[-(w^2-100w+2500-2500) \\Rightarrow -(w-50)^2+2500\\]Since the maximum value of $-(w-50)^2$ is 0 (perfect squares are always nonnegative), the maximum value of the entire expression is 2500, which is achieved when $w=50$ and $l=100-w=50$ (the playground is a square). Thus, the maximum area of the playground is $\\boxed{2500}$ square feet."
