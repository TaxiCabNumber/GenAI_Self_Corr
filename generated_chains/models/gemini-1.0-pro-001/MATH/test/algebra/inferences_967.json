I hope it is correct.'\nIf three flicks are equivalent to eight flecks, and six flocks are equivalent to four flecks, how many flocks are equivalent to $12$ flicks?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n- Since 3 flicks are equivalent to 8 flecks, 1 flick is equivalent to 8/3 flecks.\n- Since 6 flocks are equivalent to 4 flecks, 1 flock is equivalent to 4/6 flecks or 2/3 flecks.\n- Therefore, 1 flick is equivalent to 12/3 flecks.\n- So, 12 flicks are equivalent to 12 times 12/3, which is 48 flecks.\n- To find the equivalent number of flocks, we divide 48 flecks by 2/3, which gives us 48 times 3/2, which is 72 flocks.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{72}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If three flicks are equivalent to eight flecks, then twelve flicks are equivalent to $4 \\cdot 8 = 32$ flecks. Also, $32$ flecks are equivalent to $(32\\ \\text{flecks}) \\cdot \\frac{6\\ \\text{flocks}}{4\\ \\text{flecks}} = 48\\ \\text{flocks}$. Thus, $\\boxed{48}$ flocks are equivalent to $12$ flicks."
