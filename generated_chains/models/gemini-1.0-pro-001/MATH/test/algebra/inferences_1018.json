At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA new green technology can be installed in your home for a one-time installation cost of $\\$10,\\!000$ and annual maintenance costs of $\\$650$ per year. If the green technology is supposed to save you $\\$1200$ each year in energy bills, how many whole years will it take to recuperate your costs?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Calculate the total annual cost of the green technology.\nTotal annual cost = Installation cost + Annual maintenance cost\nTotal annual cost = $\\$10,\\!000 + (1200 - 650) = \\$10,\\!000 + \\$550 = \\$10,\\!550$\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the amount of money saved each year by the green technology.\nAnnual savings = Energy bill savings - Maintenance cost\nAnnual savings = $\\$1200 - \\$650 = \\$550$\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the number of years it will take to recuperate the costs.\nNumber of years = Total installation cost / Annual savings\nNumber of years = $\\$10,\\!000 / \\$550 = 18.18$\n\n**Final Answer:** \\\\boxed{$18$}.

        "ground_truth": "We look for the least number of years $n$ it takes for the savings to be greater than or equal to the costs. \\begin{align*}\n1200n&\\ge10,000+650n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n550n&\\ge10,000\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&\\ge\\frac{10,000}{550}=18.\\overline{18}\n\\end{align*}The smallest integer greater than $18.\\overline{18}$ is 19, so it will take $\\boxed{19}$ years to recuperate the costs."
