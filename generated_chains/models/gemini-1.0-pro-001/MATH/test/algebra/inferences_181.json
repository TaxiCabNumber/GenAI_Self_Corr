        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA tree is now 12 feet tall and grows 18 inches a year. In how many years will the tree be 36 feet tall?",
        "inference": "The tree grows 18 inches a year, which is equal to 1.5 feet a year. So, the number of years it will take the tree to grow from 12 feet to 36 feet is:\n(36 feet - 12 feet) / 1.5 feet per year = 16 years.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{16}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "From 12 feet to 36 feet, the tree will grow 24 feet.  If it grows at a rate of 1.5 feet per year, then it will take the tree $\\frac{24}{1.5}=\\boxed{16}$ years to reach a height of 36 feet."
