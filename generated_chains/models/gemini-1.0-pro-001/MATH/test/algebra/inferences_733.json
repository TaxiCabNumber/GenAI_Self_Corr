        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA bookstore is deciding what price it should charge for a certain book. After research, the store finds that if the book's price is $p$ dollars (where $p \\le 40$), then the number of books sold per month is $120-3p$. What price should the store charge to maximize its revenue?",
        "inference": "Revenue is the price per book multiplied by the number of books sold. So, Revenue $R(p) = 120 - 3p$ dollars.\n\nTo find the price that maximizes revenue, we take the derivative of Revenue with respect to price and set it equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp}[120 - 3p] = 0 \\Rightarrow -3 = 0$$\n\nThis gives $p=40$ dollars.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$40$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\\times$ price of each book, or\n\\[p(120-3p)=120p-3p^2.\\]We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-3$ to get $-3(p^2-40p)$.\n\nTo complete the square, we add $(40/2)^2=400$ inside the parenthesis and subtract $-3\\cdot400=-1200$ outside. We are left with the expression\n\\[-3(p^2-40p+400)+1200=-3(p-20)^2+1200.\\]Note that the $-3(p-20)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-3(p-20)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=20$. Thus, the store should charge $\\boxed{20}$ dollars for the book."
