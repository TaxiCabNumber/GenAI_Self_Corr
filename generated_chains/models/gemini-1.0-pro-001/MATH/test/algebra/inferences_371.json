I hope it is correct.'\nThis circle passes through the points $(-1, 2)$, $(3,0)$ and $(9,0)$. The center of the circle is at $(h,k)$. What is the value of $h+k$?",
        "inference": "Let the center of the circle be $(h,k)$. Then, the distances from the center to each of the three given points are equal to the radius of the circle. Using the distance formula, we have:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(h+1)^2+(k-2)^2} = \\sqrt{(h-3)^2+(k-0)^2} = \\sqrt{(h-9)^2+(k-0)^2}$$\n\nSquaring both sides of each equation and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$h^2+2h+1+k^2-4k+4 = h^2-6h+9+k^2 = h^2-18h+81+k^2$$\n\nSolving for $h$ in the first two equations, we get:\n\n$$2h+1 = -6h+9 \\Rightarrow h = 2$$\n\n$$2h+1 = -18h+81 \\Rightarrow h = 4$$\n\nSince $h$ cannot have two different values, this means the three points do not lie on a circle.
