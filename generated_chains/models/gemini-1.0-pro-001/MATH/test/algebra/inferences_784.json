At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind all values of $r$ such that $5^{2r-3} = 25$.",

        "ground_truth": "We write both sides with the same base, 5.  This gives us $5^{2r-3} = 5^2$.  Since the bases of both sides are the same, the exponents must be equal.  Therefore, we have $2r-3=2$, so $r=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$."
