At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMelanie ran at $5$ m/s for $400$ meters, then ran at $4$ m/s for the next $800$ meters, and finally ran at $8$ m/s for the final $400$ meters. What was her average speed, in meters per second, for the $1600$ meter run?  Express your answer as an improper fraction.",

        "ground_truth": "The average speed is the total distance traveled, namely $1600\\ \\text{m}$, divided by the total time of the run. It took Melanie $\\frac{400}{5}=80$ seconds to run the first $400$ meters, $\\frac{800}{4}=200$ seconds to run the next $800$ meters, and $\\frac{400}{8}=50$ seconds to run the final $400$ meters. Thus the total time of her run was $80+200+50=330$ seconds, and so her average speed for the run was $\\frac{1600}{330}=\\boxed{\\frac{160}{33}}$ meters per second."
