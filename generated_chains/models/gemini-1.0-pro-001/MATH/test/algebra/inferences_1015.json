At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind the smallest integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-5n-14$ is negative.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^2-5n-14<0$.\nFirst, we factor the expression as follows:\n$$n^2-5n-14=(n-7)(n+2).$$\n\nNow, we need to find the values of $n$ for which the expression is negative. This will occur when $(n-7)(n+2)<0$. Since $n-7<n+2$ for all $n$, we have that $n-7<0$ and $n+2>0$. Therefore, the expression is negative when $n<7$ and $n>-2$.\n\nThe smallest integer value of $n$ that satisfies these conditions is $\\boxed{n=-1}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $n=-1$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Writing this as an inequality, we get the expression \\begin{align*} n^2-5n-14&<0 \\quad \\Rightarrow\n\\\\ (n-7)(n+2)&<0.\n\\end{align*} Since -2 and 7 are roots of the quadratic, the inequality must change sign at these two points. Thus, we continue by testing the 3 intervals of $n$. For $n<-2$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $-2<n<7$, only $n-7$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $n>7$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $n$ that satisfy the inequality is $-2<n<7$. Since the question asks for the smallest integer value of $n$, the answer is the smallest integer greater than $-2$, which is $\\boxed{-1}$."
