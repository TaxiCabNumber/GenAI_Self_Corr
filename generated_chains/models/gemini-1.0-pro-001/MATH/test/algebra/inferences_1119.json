        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is $200$ and the eighth term is $500$, what is the sixth term?",
        "inference": "Let $a$ be the first term and $d$ be the common difference.\nWe are given that the fourth term is $200$, so $a+3d=200$.\nWe are also given that the eighth term is $500$, so $a+7d=500$.\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get $4d=300$, so $d=75$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get $a+3(75)=200$, so $a=-50$.\nTherefore, the sixth term is $a+5d=-50+5(75) = \\boxed{325}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{325}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sixth term is exactly halfway between the fourth and the eighth in the arithmetic sequence, so it is the average of the two terms. Therefore, the sixth term is $(200 + 500)/2 = \\boxed{350}$.  We also could have found the common difference by noting that there are four steps between the fourth term and the eighth term.  So, if $d$ is the common difference, we have $4d = 500-200 = 300$. Therefore, we find $d=75$.  The sixth term is two steps after the fourth, or $200 + 2d = \\boxed{350}$."
