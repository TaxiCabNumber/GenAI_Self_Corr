        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nLet $x$ be the number we are looking for. Then we have the equation\n\n$$x = 2 - \\frac{1}{x} .$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x$, we get\n\n$$x^2 = 2x - 1 .  $$\n\nRearranging, we have\n\n$$x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 .  $$\n\nFactoring, we get\n\n$$(x - 1)^2 = 0 .$$\n\nTherefore, $x - 1 = 0$, so $x = 1$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The question is asking us to find the smallest value of $x$ such that $x = 2\\cdot\\frac{1}{x} - 1$. We multiply through by $x$ to clear the fraction, then rearrange terms: $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. This can be factored as $(x + 2)(x - 1) = 0$. We could also use the quadratic formula to find $x$: $$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2}.$$ Either way, we find that $x = 1$ or $x = -2$. Since we want the smallest value of $x$, our answer is $\\boxed{-2}$."
