At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a total of 20 quarters stacked in four piles. The first pile has 3 fewer than the second pile. The second pile has 2 more than the third pile. The fourth pile has twice as many as the second pile. How many quarters are in the fourth pile?",
        "inference": "First, let's assign the number of quarters in the second pile as x.\nThen, the first pile has x - 3 quarters.\nThe third pile has x - 2 quarters.\nThe fourth pile has 2x quarters.\n\nWe know that there is a total of 20 quarters, so we can write an equation to solve for x:\nx + (x - 3) + (x - 2) + 2x = 20\n6x - 5 = 20\n6x = 25\nx = 25/6 (which is not a whole number, so this problem cannot be solved with the information given)\n\nFinal Answer: Solution Not Possible",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of quarters in the first, second, third, and fourth piles be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\na+b+c+d&=20\\\\ \\tag{2}\na&=b-3\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb&=c+2\\\\ \\tag{4}\nd&=2b\n\\end{align*} We want to find the value of $d$. We will express each of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $d$ and then substitute these equations into Equation (1) to find the value of $d$. From Equation (4), we have $b=d/2$. From Equation (3), we have $c=b-2$. Since $b=d/2$, we can rewrite Equation (3) as $c=d/2-2$. We can substitute $b=d/2$ into Equation (2) to get $a=d/2-3$. Substituting $b=d/2$, $c=d/2-2$, and $a=d/2-3$ into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $(d/2-3)+d/2+(d/2-2)+d=20$, so $d=10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{10}$ quarters in the fourth pile."
