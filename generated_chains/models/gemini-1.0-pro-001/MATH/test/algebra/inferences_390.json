At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA standard deck of playing cards with $26$ red cards and $26$ black cards is split into two piles, each having at least one card. In pile $A$ there are six times as many black cards as red cards. In pile $B,$ the number of red cards is a multiple of the number of black cards. How many red cards are in pile $B?$",
        "inference": "Let $b$ be the number of black cards in pile $A$ and $r$ be the number or red cards in pile $A$. Then, $b=6r$. \n\nSince the number of red cards in pile $B$ is a multiple of the number of black cards, let the number of red cards in pile $B$ be $kr$, where $k$ is an integer. Then, $kr$ is a multiple of $b$. \n\nSince $b=6r$, $kr$ is a multiple of $6r$. The only multiples of $6r$ that are also multiples of $r$ are $r$, $2r$, $3r$, $4r$, $5r$, and $6r$. \n\nSince $r$ is the number of red cards in pile $A$, it must be positive. Therefore, $kr$ must be one of $r$, $2r$, $3r$, $4r$, $5r$, or $6r$. \n\nThe only one of these that is a multiple of the number of black cards in pile $B$ is $6r$.
