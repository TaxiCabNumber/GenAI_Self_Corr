        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of teachers to students in a particular school is 1 to 11. The ratio of female students to the total number of students is 4 to 9. If there are 396 female students, how many teachers are there?",
        "inference": "Let the total number of students be 9x, and the number of female students be 4x.\nThen, 4x = 396\n=> x = 396/4 = 99\nTherefore, the total number of students = 9x = 9*99 = 891\nAnd, the number of teachers = 1/11 * 891 = 81\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{81}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since female students make up $\\frac{4}{9}$ of the total student body, multiply 396 by $\\frac{9}{4}$ to find how many students there are total.  That yields 891 students total, and since there are 11 times as many students, divide 891 by 11 to obtain $\\boxed{81\\text{ teachers}}$ total."
