At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe vertex of the parabola described by the equation $3y=2x^2-16x+18$ is $(m,n)$. What is $m+n$?",
        "inference": "The equation of the parabola is in the form $y=ax^2+bx+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. The vertex of the parabola is the point $\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, \\frac{4ac-b^2}{4a}\\right)$. \n\nIn this case, $a=2$, $b=-16$, and $c=18$, so the vertex of the parabola is $\\left(-\\frac{-16}{2(2)}, \\frac{4(2)(18)-(-16)^2}{4(2)}\\right)=\\left(4, 16\\right)$.

        "ground_truth": "We will complete the square on the given quadratic expression to find the vertex. Dividing by 3 and factoring $2$ from the first two terms, we have \\[y=\\frac23(x^2-8x)+6\\] In order to make the expression inside the parentheses a perfect square, we need to add and subtract $(8/2)^2=16$ inside the parentheses. Doing this, we get \\[y=\\frac23(x^2-8x+16-16)+6\\] so \\[y=\\frac23(x-4)^2-\\frac{32}3+6=\\frac23(x-4)^2-\\frac{14}3\\] The graph of an equation of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is a parabola with vertex at $(h,k)$, so the vertex of our parabola is at $\\left(4,-\\frac{14}3\\right)$. Thus, $m+n=4-\\frac{14}3=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$."
