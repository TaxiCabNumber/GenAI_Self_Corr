        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAbby, Bart, Cindy and Damon weigh themselves in pairs. Together Abby and Bart weigh 160 pounds, Bart and Cindy weigh 180 pounds, and Cindy and Damon weigh 200 pounds. How many pounds do Abby and Damon weigh together?",
        "inference": "Let Abby weigh x pounds and Bart weigh y pounds.\nThen Cindy weighs (180 - y) pounds and Damon weighs (200 - 180 + y).\nSo, Abby and Damon weigh x + (200 - 180 + y) = x + 20 + y pounds.\nx + 20 + y = 160\ny = 140 - x\nSo, Abby and Damon weigh x + 20 + (140 - x) = x + 20 + 140 - x = 160 pounds.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$160$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the weights of Abby, Bart, Cindy, and Damon be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=160\\\\\nb+c&=180\\\\\nc+d&=200\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $(a+b)-(b+c)=160-180 \\Rightarrow a-c=-20$. Adding this last equation to the third given equation, we have $(a-c)+(c+d)=-20+200 \\Rightarrow a+d=180$. Thus, Abby and Damon together weigh $\\boxed{180}$ pounds."
