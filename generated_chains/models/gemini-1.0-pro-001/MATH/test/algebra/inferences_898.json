        "inference": "The circumference of a circle is $2 \\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. The radius of the circle is $PQ$. Using the distance formula, we have $PQ = \\sqrt{(-2-10)^2+(3-(-2))^2} = \\sqrt{144+25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13$. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is $2 \\pi \\times 13 = \\boxed{26 \\pi}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{26 \\pi}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "To find the circumference, we must first find the length of the radius, $PQ$. We can do this by using the distance formula or by noticing that the points $P$, $Q$, and $(-2, -2)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the hypotenuse $PQ$ must equal 13.\n\nNow that we know the radius has length 13, the circumference is $2 \\cdot 13 \\pi = \\boxed{26\\pi}$."
