At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+14x=33$ has two solutions.

        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+14x+49=82 \\Rightarrow (x+7)^2=82$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+7=\\sqrt{82}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{82}-7$. Thus, $a=82$ and $b=7$, so $a+b=\\boxed{89}$."
