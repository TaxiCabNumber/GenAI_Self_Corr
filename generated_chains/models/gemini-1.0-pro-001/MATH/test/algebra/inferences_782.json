At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn investment of $\\$24,\\!000$ is made in a government bond that will pay $1\\%$ bi-monthly interest (meaning that the investment will increase by $1\\%$ every two months). At the end of five years, what is the total number of dollars in this investment?\n\nExpress your answer to the nearest whole number.",

So, in 5 years there are $6 \\times 5 = 30$ two-month periods.\n\nThe investment will increase by $1\\%$ every two months, so after $30$ two-month periods, it will have increased by $1\\% \\times 30 = 30\\%$.\n\nThis means that the total number of dollars in the investment will be $24,\\!000 + 24,\\!000 \\times 0.30 = 24,\\!000 + 7200 = 31,\\!200$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{31,\\!200}$.
