At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, $\\dots$?",
        "inference": "The 2003rd term of the sequence is the 2003rd odd number. The first odd number is 1, the second odd number is 3, and so on. Thus, the 2003rd odd number is $2003$. \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2003}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, is an arithmetic sequence, with common difference 2.  Therefore, the $2003^{\\text{rd}}$ term is $1+2002\\cdot2=\\boxed{4005}$."
