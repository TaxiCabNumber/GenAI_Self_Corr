Hence, $4^2 + 5 \\cdot 4 + \\alpha = 0$, which means $\\alpha = -36$.\n\nIf the numerator has a factor of $x + 11$, then it must be 0 when $x = -11$.  Hence, $(-11)^2 + 5 \\cdot (-11) + \\alpha = 0$, which means $\\alpha = -66$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $\\alpha$ is $-36 + (-66) = \\boxed{-102}$."
