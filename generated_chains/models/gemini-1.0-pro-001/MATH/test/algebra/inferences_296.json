        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor what ordered pair $(a,b)$ are there infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to the system \\begin{align*}\n2ax+2y&=b,\\\\\n5x+y&=-3?\n\\end{align*}",
        "inference": "We begin by multiplying the first equation by $-5$ and adding it to the second equation:\n$$-10ax-10y+5x+y=-15 \\Rightarrow -5ax-5y=-15 \\Rightarrow x=-3-5y.$$\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get\n$$2a(-3-5y)+2y=b \\Rightarrow -6a-10ay+2y=b \\Rightarrow 2y-10ay=b+6a \\Rightarrow y(2-10a)=(b+6a) \\Rightarrow y=\\frac{b+6a}{2-10a}.$$\nTherefore, there are infinite solutions $(x,y)$ to the system if $2-10a\\neq 0$, or equivalently, $a\\neq \\frac{1}{5}$. Thus, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is any pair such that $a\\neq \\frac{1}{5}$.\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$(a,b) | a\\neq \\frac{1}{5}$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "For there to be infinite solutions, the first equation needs to be consistent with the second and yet add no new information, which means it must be a multiple of the second. Since the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation is twice that of $y$ in the second equation, the multiplier is 2. This implies that the first equation must be $2(5x+y)=2(-3)$. After equating coefficients, this gives $2a=2\\cdot5$ and $b=2\\cdot-3$, or $(a,b)=\\boxed{(5,-6)}$."
