At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt a certain amusement park, there is a bulk discount for tickets. If you buy up to 60 tickets in one order, the price for each ticket is $\\$70$. However if you buy more than 60 tickets in a single order, the price of every ticket is reduced by $\\$1$ for each additional ticket bought. If $t$ is the number of tickets bought in bulk at one time, what is the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\\$4200$?",
        "inference": "Since the price per ticket is $70 when the number of tickets is 60 or less, the total profit when $t \\leq 60$ is $70 \\cdot t - 4200$.\n\nWhen $t>60$, the price per ticket is $70 - (t-60) = 10 + 60 = 70$ sub $t$ plus 60, and the total profit is $(70 - (t-60)) \\cdot t - 4200 = (110 - t) \\cdot t - 4200$ sub 110 minus t times t minus 4200.\n\nTo find the largest $t$ such that the profit is greater than $4200, we need to solve the inequality:\n\n$$(110 - t) \\cdot t - 4200 > 0$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n$$110t - t^2 - 4200 > 0$$\n\n$$t^2 - 110t + 4200 < 0$$\n\nFactoring:\n\n$$(t - 60)(t - 70) < 0$$\n\nThe expression is negative when $t$ is between 60 and 70, so the largest $t$ that satisfies the inequality is $t = \\boxed{69}$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$69$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \\begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)\n\\\\4200&<(130-t)(t)\n\\\\4200&<130t-t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0\n\\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\\$4200$ is $t=\\boxed{69}$."
