        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt took Lara five days to read a novel. Each day after the first day, Lara read half as many pages as the day before. If the novel was 248 pages long, how many pages did she read on the first day?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**:  Let x be the number of pages Lara read on the first day.\n\n**Step 2**:  We know that on the second day, she read half as many pages as the first day, so she read x/2 pages on the second day.\n\n**Step 3:**  On the third day, she read half as many pages as the second day, so she read x/4 pages on the third day.\n\n**Step 4:**  On the fourth day, she read half as many pages as the third day, so she read x/8 pages on the fourth day.\n\n**Step 5**:  On the fifth day, she read half as many pages as the fourth day, so she read x/16 pages on the fifth day.\n\n**Step 6**:  The total number of pages she read is the sum of the pages she read on each day, so we have x + x/2 + x/4 + x/8 + x/16 = 248\n\n**Step 7**:  Simplifying the equation, we get 31x/16 = 248\n\n**Step 8**: Multiplying both sides by 16/31, we get x = 128\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$128$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If Lara read $P$ pages on the first day, then she read $P/2$ pages the second day, $P/4$ pages on the third day, $P/8$ pages on the fourth day, and $P/16$ pages on the fifth day.  In total, she read  \\[\nP+\\frac{P}{2}+\\frac{P}{4}+\\frac{P}{8}+\\frac{P}{16}=\\frac{31}{16}P\n\\] pages. Setting this equal to 248, we find that Lara read $P=\\frac{16}{31}\\cdot248=\\boxed{128}$ pages."
