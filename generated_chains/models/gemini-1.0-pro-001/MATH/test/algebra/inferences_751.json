At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe integers 2 through 9 are each placed in the figure with one integer in each of the eight smallest triangles. The integers are placed so that the pairs of integers in each of the four smallest squares have the same sum.

The sum of the two numbers in the 2x2 squares is 10, so the number in the small square on top and the number in the small square on the right must both be 5. The numbers in the 1x2 rectangles must then add up to 5. The only way to do this is with a 3 and a 2 in the top rectangle and a 1 and a 4 in the right rectangle.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{10} I hope it is correct.",

The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum is $(2 + 9)/2 \\cdot 8 = 44$. Since each of the four smallest squares have the same sum, they each have a sum of $44/4 = \\boxed{11}$."
