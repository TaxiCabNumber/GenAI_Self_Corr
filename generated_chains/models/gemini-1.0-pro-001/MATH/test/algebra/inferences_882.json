        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAlice and Bob are playing a game. Alice starts first. On Alice's turn, she flips a coin. If she gets a heads, she wins. If not, it becomes Bob's turn. On Bob's turn, he flips a coin. If he gets a tails, he wins. If not, it becomes Alice's turn. What is the probability that Alice wins the game?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Find the probability that Alice wins on her first turn.\nAlice wins on her first turn if she flips a heads, which has a probability of 1/2.**\n\n**Step 2: Find the probability that Alice wins on her second turn.\nAlice wins on her second turn if she flips a tails on her first turn (with probability 1/2) and then flips a heads on her second turn (with probability 1/2). The probability of this happening is (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4.**\n\n**Step 3: Find the probability that Alice wins on her third turn.\nAlice wins on her third turn if she flips a tails on her first two turns (with probability 1/4) and then flips a heads on her third turn (with probability 1/2). The probability of this happening is (1/4) x (1/2) = 1/8.**\n\n**Step 4: Find the probability that Alice wins on her fourth turn.\nAlice wins on her fourth turn if she flips a tails on her first three turns (with probability 1/8) and then flips a heads on her fourth turn (with probability 1/2). The probability of this happening is (1/8) x (1/2) = 1/16.**\n\n**Step 5: Find the probability that Alice wins on her fifth turn.\nAlice wins on her fifth turn if she flips a tails on her first four turns (with probability 1/16) and then flips a heads on her fifth turn (with probability 1/2). The probability of this happening is (1/16) x (1/2) = 1/32.**\n\n**Step 6: Sum the probabilities of Alice winning on each turn.\nThe probability that Alice wins the game is the sum of the probabilities of her winning on each turn, which is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 = 31/32.**\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{31}{32}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Alice has a $1/2$ chance of winning the game on her first turn. If she doesn't, then the probability that she wins the game on her second turn is $1/8,$ since she must not win on her first flip ($1/2$ chance), Bob must not win on his first flip ($1/2$ chance), and then Alice must win on her second flip ($1/2$ chance). The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game."
