At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a $100$ meter track event, Alice runs at a constant speed and crosses the finish line $5$ seconds before Beatrice does. If it took Beatrice $25$ seconds to complete the race, how many seconds would it take Alice to run $50$ meters?",
        "inference": "- Since Beatrice took $25$ seconds to run $100$ meters, she ran at a speed of $100/25=4$ meters per second.\n- Since Alice finished $5$ seconds before Beatrice, she must have run at a speed of $4+5=9$ meters per second.\n- To run $50$ meters, Alice will take $\\frac{50}{9}=\\boxed{5\\frac{5}{9}}$ seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5\\frac{5}{9}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Alice took $25 - 5 = 20$ seconds to complete the race. If she can run $100$ meters in $20$ seconds, by direct proportionality, she must be able to run $\\frac{100}{2} = 50$ meters in $\\frac{20}{2} = \\boxed{10}$ seconds."
