        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2}$, what is the smallest possible integer value for $x$ such that $f(x)$ has a real number value?",
        "inference": "The numerator $\\sqrt{x-1}$ must be non-negative. So, $x-1 \\ge 0$ which means $x \\ge 1$. The denominator $x-2$ cannot be equal to $0$. So, $x \\ne 2$. Therefore, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "In order for $f(x)$ to have a real number value, the expression inside the square root in the numerator must be non-negative and the denominator must not be 0. So we have the two conditions $x-1\\ge0 \\Rightarrow x \\ge 1$ and $x-2 \\ne 0 \\Rightarrow x \\ne 2$. We see that $x=\\boxed{1}$ is the smallest integer value that satisfies both conditions."
