At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJo has given Aiden at least one toy car every birthday. The number of cars has corresponded to Aiden's age (one car for his first birthday, two cars for his second birthday, and so on). After receiving the cars for his 12th birthday, how many total toy cars will Aiden have received from Jo?",

Aiden's 12th birthday: 12 cars\n\nSo, the total number of toy cars Aiden will have received from Jo is $1+2+3+\\cdots+12 = \\frac{12\\times13}{2} = 78$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{78}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "After his 12th birthday, Aiden has received $1+2+\\cdots+12$ cars.  This sum is equal to $1 + 2 + \\dots + 12 = 12 \\cdot 13/2 = \\boxed{78}$."
