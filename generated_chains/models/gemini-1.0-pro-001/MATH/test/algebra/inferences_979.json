At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTogether, Larry and Lenny have $\\$$35. Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount. How many more dollars than Larry does Lenny have?",
        "inference": "Let's set up the equation:\nLarry's amount (L) = 2/5 * Lenny's amount (Le)\nTogether, Larry and Lenny have $35:\nL + Le = 35\nSubstitute L = 2/5 * Le:\n (2/5 * Le) + Le = 35\nCombine like terms:\n(7/5) * Le = 35\nTo isolate Le, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 7/5, which is 5/7:\n(5/7) * (7/5) * Le = (35) * (5/7)\nLe = 25\nNow find the difference between Lenny's amount (Le) and Larry's amount (L):\nLe - L = Le - (2/5 * Le)\nLe - L =Le (1-2/5)\nLe - L = Le (3/5)\nSubstitute Le = 25:\n25 - L = 25 (3/5)\n25 - L = 15\nLenny has 15 more dollars than Larry.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{15}$.

        "ground_truth": "Call the amount of money Larry has $a$ and the amount of money Lenny has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 35 \\\\\na &= \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot b \\\\\n\\end{align*} Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $\\frac{2}{5} b + b = 35$. Solving for $b$ gives $\\frac{7}{5} b = 35$, or $b = 25$. Thus, $a = 35 - 25 = 10$. So Lenny has $25 - 10 = \\boxed{15}$ more dollars than Larry."
