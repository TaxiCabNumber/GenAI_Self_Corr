At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIt's a well-known physics formula that force equals mass times acceleration.  Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball.  If the softball has a mass of $200$ g and the baseball has a mass of $150$ g, what is the ratio of acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's?  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
        "inference": "Force is equal to mass times acceleration.  Thus,\n$$F=ma$$\nSince Jen and Jack apply equal force to the balls,\n$$F_J=F$$\nTherefore,\n$$m_J\\cdot a_J=F=m_B\\cdot a_B$$\nDividing both sides by \\(m_J\\cdot a_J\\), we obtain,\n$$\\frac{a_B}{a_J}=\\frac{m_J}{m_B}=\\frac{200}{150}=\\frac{4}{3}$$\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If $j_1$ is the acceleration of Jen's ball and $j_2$ is the acceleration of Jack's ball, then we have $$j_1 \\cdot 200 = j_2 \\cdot 150\\qquad \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{j_1}{j_2} = \\boxed{\\frac 34}.$$"
