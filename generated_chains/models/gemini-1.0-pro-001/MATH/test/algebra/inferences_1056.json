At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMarsha adds all but one of the first ten positive integers. Her sum is a square number. Which one of the first ten positive integers did Marsha not include?",
        "inference": "The sum of the first ten positive integers is 55. The square numbers between 1 and 55 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. Therefore, Marsha must have missed one of the following numbers: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 10. The sum of the remaining numbers is 40, which is a square number. Therefore, Marsha must have missed $\\boxed{10}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let's find the sum of the first ten positive integers: $1+2+\\ldots+10=\\frac{10(1+10)}{2}=55$. Now we need to find which of the first ten positive integers, when subtracted from 55, gives a perfect square, namely 49 (36 is 19 away from 55, so it cannot be obtained). The desired integer is $\\boxed{6}$ since $55-6=49=7^2$."
