        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nReversing the digits in John's age results in his father's age. The positive difference between their ages is 27 years. If the sum of the digits in each age is 5, what is the number of years in John's father's age?",
        "inference": "Let F be John's father's age and J be John's age.\nThen we know that:\nF - J = 27\nJ + F = 10x + 5 (Since the sum of the digits in each age is 5)\nAlso, F = 10J + J\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n10J + J - J = 27\n11J = 27\nJ = 27/11 \u2248 2.45 (But John's age cannot be a fraction)\nTherefore, John's age is 3 and his father's age is 30.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $t$ and $u$ be the tens and units digits of John's age.  We are told that $t+u=5$ and $10u+t-(10t+u)=27$.  Rewriting the second equation as $9(u-t)=27$ and dividing by 9, we have \\begin{align*}\nt+u&=5 \\\\\nt-u&=3.\n\\end{align*} Summing these equations, we find $2t=8$, which implies $t=4$.  Substituting back into either equation, we find $u=1$, so John's father is $10t+u=\\boxed{41}$ years old."
