At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe $XYZ$ company has to pay $\\$5,000$ for rent each month. In addition, their monthly electricity bill is$ \\$1.45$ per kilowatt-hour of electricity used. If the total cost for both rent and electricity in January was $\\$16,520.25$, how many kilowatt-hours of electricity did they use?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity used.\nThe total cost for both rent and electricity is $5000+1.45x$.\nSince the total cost was $16,520.25$, we have\n\n$$5000+1.45x = 16,520.25.$$Solving for $x$, we get\n\n$$1.45x = 16,520.25-5000,$$\n\n$$1.45x = 11,520.25,$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{11,520.25}{1.45},$$\n\n$$x = 7945.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7945}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ is the number of kilowatt-hours of power that the company used in January, then the company paid $5000+1.45x$ dollars for that month.  Setting $5000+1.45x=16520.25,$ we find $x=(16520.25-5000)/1.45=\\boxed{7945}$."
