At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertical axis of symmetry.  The vertex of this parabola is $(2,3)$ and the parabola contains the point $(4,4)$.  Find the value of $y$ when $x=6$.",
        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the vertex of the parabola is $(2,3)$, we have $a=1$ and $b=2$.  Substituting these values into the equation for the parabola, we get $y=x^2 + 2x + c$.  To find the value of $c$, we can substitute the coordinates of the point $(4,4)$ into the equation: $$4=(4)^2 + 2(4) + c \\Rightarrow c=-8.$$  Therefore, the equation of the parabola is $y=x^2 + 2x - 8$.  To find the value of $y$ when $x=6$, we simply substitute this value into the equation: $$y=(6)^2 + 2(6) - 8 = 36 + 12 - 8 = 40.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Because the parabola has vertex $(2,3)$, it is the graph of  \\[y=a(x-2)^2+3\\] for some number $a$.  In order for the graph to contain the point $(4,4)$, we must also have  \\[4=a(4-2)^2+3=4a+3,\\] so $a=\\frac14$, and our parabola is the graph of \\[y=\\frac14(x-2)^2 + 3.\\] Setting $x=6$ in this gives us  \\[y = \\frac14(6-2)^2 + 3 = 4+3=\\boxed{7}.\\]"
