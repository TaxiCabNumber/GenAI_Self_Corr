        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nWe know that the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence is the same. So, we can write the common difference as $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$.\n\nSince $y + 6$ and $y$ are also consecutive terms in the sequence, we have another equation for the common difference: $y - (y + 6) = -6$.\n\nSetting these two equations for the common difference equal to each other, we get:\n$6 - y = -6$.\nSolving this equation for $y$, we get:\n$y = 12$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The difference between the second and first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the third and second term is $y - 12$.  These must be equal, so $6 - y = y - 12$.  Solving for $y$, we find $y = \\boxed{9}$."
