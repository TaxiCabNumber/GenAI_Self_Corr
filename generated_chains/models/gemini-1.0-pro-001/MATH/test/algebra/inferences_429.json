At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nNew York and Denver are in different time zones.  When it is noon in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver.  A train leaves New York at 2 p.m. (New York time) and arrives in Denver 45 hours later.  What time is it in Denver when the train arrives?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Convert the departure time to Denver time.\n\n- When it is 2 p.m. in New York, it is 10 a.m. in Denver.\n- Therefore, 2 p.m. New York time is 12 p.m. Denver time.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the travel time in Denver time.\n\n- The train leaves at 12 p.m. Denver time.\n- It arrives 45 hours later.\n- Therefore, the train arrives at **12 p.m. + 45 hours = 3 p.m.** Denver time.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$3$ p.m.}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "2 p.m. New York time is noon in Denver.  45 hours past noon is 21 hours past noon the next day, which is 9 a.m. the day after that.  Think about it this way - 48 hours would mean two full days, and 45 hours is 3 hours less than that, thus, 3 hours before noon is $\\boxed{9\\text{ a.m.}}$"
