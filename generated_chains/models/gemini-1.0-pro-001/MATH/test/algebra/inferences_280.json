        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$, how many lattice points does the line $y = -2x + 18$ pass through? (A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.)",
        "inference": "The line $y = -2x + 18$ has a slope of $-2$ and a $y$-intercept of $18$. This means that for every $2$ units you move to the right, you move $1$ unit down.\n\nTo find the number of lattice points that the line passes through, we can divide the length of the line between the $x$- and $y$-axes into $2$-unit segments. There will be $9$ such segments since the line has a length of $18$.\n\nFor each $2$-unit segment, there is $1$ lattice point on the line. Therefore, there are a total of $9$ lattice points that the line passes through.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$9$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We look at the $x$-intercept and the $y$-intercept. Since $y = -2(x - 9)$, at $x = 0,\\; y = 18$, and at $x = 9,\\; y = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $(0,18)$ and the $x$-intercept is $(9,0)$. In order to keep both $x$ and $y$ integral, we investigate further. Since the slope is $-2$, a negative integer, and $y$ must be a nonnegative integer, $x - 9$ must be a nonpositive integer. This means that all the integer $x$ values between 0 and $9$, inclusive are valid, since $x \\leq 9$ and so $x - 9 \\leq 0$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{10}$ total lattice points."
