At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $70 + m + n - 20 = 80$ and $m = 2n$, then what is the value of $n$?",
        "inference": "1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n$$70 + m + n - 20 = 80$$\n$$50 + m + n = 80$$\n\n2. Substitute m = 2n into the equation:\n$$50 + 2n + n = 80$$\n$$50 + 3n = 80$$\n\n3. Isolate the term with n by subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation:\n$$50 + 3n = 80$$\n$$3n = 30$$\n\n4. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for n:\n$$\\frac{3n}{3} = \\frac{30}{3}$$\n$$n = 10$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Substituting $m=2n$ into the first equation gives $70 + 2n + n - 20 = 80$.  Simplifying the left side gives $3n +50 = 80$.  Subtracting 50 from both sides gives $3n = 30$, so $n = \\boxed{10}$."
