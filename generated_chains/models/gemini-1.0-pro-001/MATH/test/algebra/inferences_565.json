At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMonica, who is 5 feet tall, is standing next to a pine tree that casts a shadow 34 feet long. If Monica's shadow is 2 feet long, how tall is the pine tree, in feet?",
        "inference": "Let x be the height of the pine tree in feet.\n\nSince the shadows are similar, we can write the proportion:\n\nx/5 = 34/2\n\nCross-multiply to get:\n\n2x = 34*5 = 170\n\nDivide both sides by 2 to get:\n\nx = 170/2 = 85\n\nFinal Answer: \\( \\boxed{85} \\). I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Monica's shadow is $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as she is tall, so the pine tree's shadow is also $\\dfrac{2}{5}$ times as long as the tree is tall. Since the pine tree's shadow is 34 feet long, the pine tree itself is $34\\div \\dfrac{2}{5}=(34)\\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{85\\text{ feet}}$ tall."
