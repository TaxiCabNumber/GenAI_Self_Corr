At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form.",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the calories per fluid ounce: 125 calories / 8 fluid ounces = 15.625 calories/fluid ounce.\n**Step 2:** Multiply the calories per fluid ounce by the number of fluid ounces in the 12-ounce bottle: 15.625 calories/fluid ounce * 12 fluid ounces = 187.5 calories.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{187.5}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=\\boxed{187.5}$ calories."
