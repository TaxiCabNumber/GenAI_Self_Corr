        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe product of two consecutive odd whole numbers is 255. What is the greater number?",
        "inference": "Let the two consecutive odd whole numbers be $x$ and $x+2$. Then we have the equation $x(x+2)=255$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $x^2+2x=255$. Rearranging, we get $x^2+2x-255=0$. Factoring, we get $(x-15)(x+17)=0$. Therefore, $x=15$ or $x=-17$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, $x=15$. The greater number is $x+2=15+2=\\boxed{17}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $2n-1, 2n+1$ be two consecutive odd whole numbers. We know $(2n-1)(2n+1)=4n^2-1=255\\Leftrightarrow n^2=64$. $n$ is a whole number, so $n=8$. The greater number is $2n+1=2\\cdot8+1=\\boxed{17}$."
