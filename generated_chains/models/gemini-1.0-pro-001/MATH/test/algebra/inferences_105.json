        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTogether, Amy and Betty have 20 apples. Amy has three times the number of apples that Betty has. How many more apples than Betty does Amy have?",
        "inference": "Let the number of apples Betty has be x.\nThen, the number of apples Amy has is 3x.\nTogether, they have 20 apples.\nTherefore, x + 3x = 20.\n4x = 20\nx = 5\nTherefore, Betty has 5 apples and Amy has 3x = 3 * 5 = 15 apples.\nSo, Amy has 15 - 5 = 10 more apples than Betty.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the amount of apples Amy has $a$ and the amount of apples Betty has $b$. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\na + b &= 20 \\\\\na &= 3b \\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting for $a$ into the first equation gives $3b + b = 20$. Solving for $b$ gives $b = 5$. Thus $a = 15$. So Amy has $15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}$ more apples than Betty."
