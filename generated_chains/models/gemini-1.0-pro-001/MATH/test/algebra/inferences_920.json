At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs?",
        "inference": "Start by converting 80 lugs to lags:\n$$80 \\text{ lugs}\\cdot\\frac{9\\text{ lags}}{20\\text{ lugs}}=36\\text{ lags}$$\nThen convert the 36 lags to ligs:\n$$36\\text{ lags}\\cdot\\frac{7\\text{ ligs}}{4\\text{ lags}}=63\\text{ ligs}$$\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$63$}.

        "ground_truth": "Multiply the second equation by 4 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 80 lugs.  Then multiply the first equation by 9 to find that 36 lags are equivalent to 63 ligs.  Since each is equivalent to 36 lags, 80 lugs and $\\boxed{63}$ ligs are equivalent."
