At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many integers belong to the arithmetic sequence 13, 20, 27, 34, $\\dots$, 2008?",
        "inference": "There are $a_1 = 13$, $d = 7$, and $a_n = 2008$. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$. Substituting $a_n = 2008$, $a_1 = 13$, and $d = 7$, we get $2008 = 13 + (n - 1)7$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 283$.
