At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(3,1)$ and $(5,1)$?",

So, the midpoint of the line segment with endpoints $(3,1)$ and $(5,1)$ is $\\left(\\frac{3+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2}\\right) = (4,1)$. The sum of the coordinates of this midpoint is $4+1 = 5$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{5}. I hope it is correct.",
