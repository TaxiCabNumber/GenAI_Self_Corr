        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nRecently, Frank took a one-hundred question aptitude test where each correct answer scored $5$ points, each incorrect answer scored $-2$ points, and each question not answered scored zero points. Frank answered $80$ questions and scored $232$ points. How many questions did he answer correctly?",
        "inference": "1. Let's assume the number of questions Frank answered correctly is $x$.\n2. The number of questions he answered incorrectly is $80 - x$.\n3. Frank's score for answering $x$ questions correctly is $5x$.\n4. Frank's score for answering $80 - x$ questions incorrectly is $-2(80 - x) = -160 + 2x$.\n5. Frank's total score is $5x + (-160 + 2x) = 7x - 160$.\n6. We know that Frank's total score is 232, so we can set up the equation $7x - 160 = 232$.\n7. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{232 + 160}{7} = 56$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{56}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of questions Frank answered correctly be $a$ and the number of questions he answered incorrectly be $b$. We have the two equations \\begin{align*}\na+b&=80\\\\\n5a-2b&=232\n\\end{align*} From the first equation, we have $b=80-a$. Substituting this into the second equation to eliminate $b$, we have $5a-2(80-a)=232\\Rightarrow a=56$. Thus, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly."
