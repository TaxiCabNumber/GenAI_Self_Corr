        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct rectangles are there with integer side lengths such that the numerical value of area of the rectangle in square units is equal to $5$ times the numerical value of the perimeter in units? (Two rectangles are considered to be distinct if they are not congruent.)",
        "inference": "Let the length and width of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$, respectively. Then we have\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nlw&=5(2l+2w)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l&=5(2+\\frac{w}{l})\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l(l-10)&=10w\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l-10&=\\frac{10w}{l}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l^2-10l&=10w\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l^2-10l-10w&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (l-10)(l+w)&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad l&=10\\ \\text{ or }\\ w=-l.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nIf $l=10$, then $w=1$. If $w=-l$, then $l=-2,-3,-4,-5,-10$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{6}$ distinct rectangles with integer side lengths such that the numerical value of the area of the rectangle in square units is equal to $5$ times the numerical value of the perimeter in units.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$6$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the side lengths of the rectangle be $a$ and $b$ with $a\\leq b$. Then $ab=10(a+b).$ Expanding and moving all the terms to the left hand side gives $ab-10a-10b=0.$ We apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $100$ to both sides to allow us to factor the left hand side: $$ab-10a-10b+100 = (a-10)(b-10)=100$$From this, we know that $(a-10,b-10)$ must be a pair of factors of $100$. Consequently, the pairs $(a,b)$ that provide different areas are $(11,110),$ $(12, 60),$ $(14, 35),$ $(15, 30),$ and $(20,20)$. There are therefore $\\boxed{5}$ distinct rectangles with the desired property."
