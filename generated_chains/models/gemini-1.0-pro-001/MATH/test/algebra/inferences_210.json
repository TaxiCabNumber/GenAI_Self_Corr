At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe interior angles of a quadrilateral form an arithmetic sequence. If the measure of the largest angle is $129^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the second largest angle, in degrees?",
        "inference": "Let the angles be denoted by $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$, where $a_1$ is the smallest angle and $a_4$ is the largest angle. Since the angles form an arithmetic sequence, we have:\n$$a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = a_4 - a_3$$\nWe are given that $a_4 = 129^{\\circ}$, so we have:\n$$a_4 = 129^{\\circ} = a_1 + 3(a_2 - a_1)$$\nSince $a_1$ is the smallest angle, we have:\n$$a_1 < 129^{\\circ} = a_4$$\nTherefore:\n$$a_1 < a_1 + 3(a_2 - a_1) = 129^{\\circ}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3(a_2 - a_1) < 129^{\\circ}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow a_2 - a_1 < 43^{\\circ}$$\nSince $a_2$ is the second largest angle, we have:\n$$a_2 < a_4 = 129^{\\circ}$$\nTherefore:\n$$a_2 < 129^{\\circ} = a_1 + 3(a_2 - a_1)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 3(a_2 - a_1) > 129^{\\circ} - a_2$$\n$$\\Rightarrow a_2 - a_1 > 43^{\\circ}$$\nHence, we have:\n$$43^{\\circ} < a_2 - a_1 < 43^{\\circ}$$\nWhich is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no such quadrilateral.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{No\\;Solution}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the common difference of this arithmetic sequence be $d$, so the second largest angle is $129-d$ degrees, the third largest is $129-2d$ degrees, and the smallest angle is $129-3d$ degrees. We know that the sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is equal to 360 degrees, so we have the equation $129 + (129-d) + (129-2d) + (129-3d) = 360$, from which we find that $d=26$ degrees. Thus, the second largest angle is $129-d=129-26=\\boxed{103}$ degrees."
