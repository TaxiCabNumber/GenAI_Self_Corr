        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe equation $x^2+18x=27$ has two solutions. The positive solution has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. What is $a+b$?",
        "inference": "Since the equation $x^2+18x=27$ has two solutions, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$:\n$$x=\\frac{-18\\pm\\sqrt{18^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot27}}{2\\cdot1}=\\frac{-18\\pm\\sqrt{252}}{2}=\\frac{-18\\pm14}{2}.$$\n\nSo $x=-4$ and $x=13$. The positive solution is $x=13$, which has the form $\\sqrt{a}-b$ for positive natural numbers $a$ and $b$. We can solve for $a$ and $b$:\n$$\\begin{align}\\sqrt{a}-b&=13\\\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sqrt{a}&=13+b\\\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\qquad a&=(13+b)^2=169+26b+b^2.\\end{align}$$\n\nTherefore, $a+b=169+26b+b^2+b=\\boxed{169+27b}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{169+27b}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we add $(18/2)^2=81$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^2+18x+81=108 \\Rightarrow (x+9)^2=108$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x+9=\\sqrt{108}$ (we take the positive square root because we want the positive solution), or $x=\\sqrt{108}-9$. Thus, $a=108$ and $b=9$, so $a+b=\\boxed{117}$."
