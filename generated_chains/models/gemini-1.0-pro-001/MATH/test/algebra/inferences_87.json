At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "The product of the roots of this quadratic is $-36/1=-36$, so the other solution must be $-36/-4=9$. That means that the sum of the solutions is $-4+9=5$. The sum of the solutions is also $-b/1=-b$. Thus, $-b=5$ and $b=\\boxed{-5}$."
