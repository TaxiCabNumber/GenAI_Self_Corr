        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJeremiah is riding in a car that is traveling 60 miles per hour. At this rate, how many minutes will it take him to travel 20 miles?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute: $$60\\text{ mph}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60\\text{ minutes}}=1\\text{ mph}$$\n2. Divide the distance by the speed to find the time it will take to travel that distance: $$\\frac{20\\text{ miles}}{1\\text{ mph}}=20\\text{ minutes}$$ Final Answer: \\boxed{20}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Distance equals rate times time, so the trip will take $$\\frac{20\\text{ mi.}}{60\\text{ mph}}=\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ hours}.$$  One-third of an hour is $\\boxed{20}$ minutes."
