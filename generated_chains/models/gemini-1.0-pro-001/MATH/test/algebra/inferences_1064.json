        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA set of four consecutive integers has a sum of 22. If each integer of the set is increased by 2 and then multiplied by 20, what is the sum of the new set of integers?",

        "ground_truth": "Increasing each integer by 2 will increase their sum by $2\\cdot 4 = 8$, meaning the sum after this step is $22 + 8 = 30$.  Multiplying each integer by 20 will multiply the entire sum by 20, leading to a final sum of $30\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{600}$."
