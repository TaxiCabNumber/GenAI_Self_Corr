At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe expression $3x^2 + 14x + 8$ can be written in the form $(3x + A)(x + B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are integers. What is the value of $A - B$?",

These integers are $6$ and $4$.\n\nTherefore, $A = 6$ and $B = 4$.\n\nFinally, find the value of $A - B$:\n\n$$A - B = 6 - 4 = 2.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{2}. I hope it is correct.**",
