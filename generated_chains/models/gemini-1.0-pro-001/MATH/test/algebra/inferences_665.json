At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola $y=x^2-5$ can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a}/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, and $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b$.",
        "inference": "The distance between the origin and a point $(x,y)$ on the parabola is given by $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+(x^2-5)^2}=\\sqrt{2x^4-10x^2+5}$.\n\nTo minimize this distance, we need to minimize $2x^4-10x^2+5$.  Since $2x^4-10x^2+5=2(x^2-5/2)^2+5/2$, the minimum value of $2x^4-10x^2+5$ is $5/2$, which occurs when $x^2=5/2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the parabola is $\\sqrt{5/2}=\\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ is a prime, $a=5$ and $b=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, $a+b=5+\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5+\\sqrt{2}}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the distance formula, we are trying to minimize $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}$. In general minimization problems like this require calculus, but one elementary optimization method that sometimes works is completing the square.  We have $$\\sqrt{x^2+x^4-10x^2+25}=\\sqrt{(x^2-9/2)^2+(25-81/4)}.$$This expression is minimized when the square equals $0$, i.e. when $x=\\pm 3/\\sqrt{2}.$ For this value of $x$, the distance is $$\\sqrt{25-\\frac{81}{4}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}.$$Hence the desired answer is $\\boxed{21}$."
