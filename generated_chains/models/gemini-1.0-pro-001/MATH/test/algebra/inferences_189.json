At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "By the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}, \\frac{-b - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}$. The difference of these is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} = \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}$. Setting this equal to $|b - 2c|$, it follows that (after squaring) $b^2 - 4c = (b-2c)^2 = b^2 + 4c^2 - 4bc$. Thus $$0 = 4c^2 + 4c - 4bc = 4c(c - b + 1).$$As $c \\neq 0$, it follows that $c = \\boxed{b - 1}$."
