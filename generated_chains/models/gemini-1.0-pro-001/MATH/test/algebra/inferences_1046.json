At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuzanne walks four miles every third day. What is the fewest number of miles she can walk in February?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThere are 28 days in February. Suzanne walks every third day, so she walks for $\\frac{28}{3}=9.33$ days. Since she walks 4 miles each time she walks, she will walk a total of $9.33\\times 4=37.32$ miles.\n\nHowever, we need to find the fewest number of miles she can walk. Since she can't walk a fraction of a mile, she will walk 37 miles.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{37}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "February has 28 days with one extra day during leap years. We want the fewest number of miles, so we go with 28 days in February. The fewest number of days she can walk is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{28}{3}\\right\\rfloor=9$. So the fewest number of miles she can walk is $9\\cdot4=\\boxed{36}$ miles."
