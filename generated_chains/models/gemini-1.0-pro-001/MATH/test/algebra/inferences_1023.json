Find the vertex of the graph of $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$.\n\nThe vertex of a parabola in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the formula $$\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}, f\\left(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$ and $b = -8$, so the vertex is $$\\left(-\\frac{-8}{2\\cdot1}, f\\left(-\\frac{-8}{2\\cdot1}\\right)\\right) = \\left(4, f(4)\\right)$$\n\nTo find $f(4)$, we substitute $x = 4$ into the equation $f(x) = x^2 - 8x + 15$: $$f(4) = 4^2 - 8\\cdot4 + 15 = 16 - 32 + 15 = -1$$\n\nTherefore, the vertex is $(4, -1)$.\n\n2.
