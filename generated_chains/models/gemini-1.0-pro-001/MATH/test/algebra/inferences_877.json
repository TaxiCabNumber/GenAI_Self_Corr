        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first term of an arithmetic sequence is $2$. The sum of the third and the sixth terms is $25$. What is the fourth term?",
        "inference": "Let the common difference be $d$.\nThen, the second term is $2+d$, the third term is $2+2d$, the fourth term is $2+3d$, the fifth term is $2+4d$, and the sixth term is $2+5d$.\n\nAccording to the given information, the sum of the third and the sixth terms is $25$. Therefore, we have\n\n$$(2+2d)+(2+5d)=25$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $d$, we get\n\n$$4+7d=25$$\n\n$$7d=21$$\n\n$$d=3$$\n\nThus, the fourth term is $2+3d=\\boxed{11}.$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Call the difference between two consecutive terms $x$. The third term is then $2+2x$, and the sixth term is $2+5x$. So, $25 = (2+2x) + (2+5x)$. Solving for $x$ gives $7x = 21$, or $x = 3$. So, the fourth term is $2 + 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{11}$."
