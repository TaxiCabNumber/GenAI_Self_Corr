        "inference": "The discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ is given by $b^2-4ac = 7^2-4(1)(c)$. \nFor the equation to have real and rational roots, the discriminant must be a perfect square. \nTherefore, we have $7^2-4(1)(c)=k^2$ for some integer $k$. \nSolving for $c$, we get $c=\\frac{7^2-k^2}{4}$. \nSince $k$ must be an integer, the numerator $7^2-k^2$ must be a multiple of $4$. \nThe only such values of $k$ are $k=1,3,5,7$. \nTherefore, the corresponding values of $c$ are $c=\\frac{7^2-1^2}{4}=\\boxed{12}$, $c=\\frac{7^2-3^2}{4}=\\boxed{8}$, $c=\\frac{7^2-5^2}{4}=\\boxed{4}$, and $c=\\frac{7^2-7^2}{4}=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12,8,4,0}$.

        "ground_truth": "For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\\boxed{12, 10, 6}$."
