At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConnie is starting an exercise program. On June 1, she will do 25 sit-ups. Each day after that, she will increase her number of sit-ups by four. On which date during the month of June will Connie first do more than 100 sit-ups in one day?",
        "inference": "**Step 1: Determine if Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups on June 1.**\n25 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups. So, Connie will not do more than 100 sit-ups on June 1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine if Connie will do more than 100 sit-ups on June 2.**\nOn June 2, Connie will do 25 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 29 sit-ups. 29 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.

So, Connie will not do more than 100 sit-ups on June 3.\n\n**Step 4: Continue this process until you find the date when Connie will first do more than 100 sit-ups.**\nOn June 4, Connie will do 33 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 37 sit-ups. 37 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 5, Connie will do 37 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 41 sit-ups. 41 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 6, Connie will do 41 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 45 sit-ups. 45 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 7, Connie will do 45 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 49 sit-ups. 49 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 8, Connie will do 49 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 53 sit-ups. 53 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 9, Connie will do 53 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 57 sit-ups. 57 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 10, Connie will do 57 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 61 sit-ups. 61 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 11, Connie will do 61 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 65 sit-ups. 65 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 12, Connie will do 65 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 69 sit-ups. 69 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 13, Connie will do 69 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 73 sit-ups. 73 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 14, Connie will do 73 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 77 sit-ups. 77 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 15, Connie will do 77 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 81 sit-ups. 81 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 16, Connie will do 81 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 85 sit-ups. 85 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 17, Connie will do 85 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 89 sit-ups. 89 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 18, Connie will do 89 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 93 sit-ups. 93 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 19, Connie will do 93 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 97 sit-ups. 97 sit-ups is less than 100 sit-ups.\nOn June 20, Connie will do 97 sit-ups + 4 sit-ups = 101 sit-ups. 101 sit-ups is more than 100 sit-ups.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$June\\ 20$}.
