        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA point $(x,y)$ on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative is a distance of 6 units from the $x$-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point $(8,3)$. It is a distance $\\sqrt{n}$ from the origin. What is $n$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nThe distance from $(x,y)$ to the $x$-axis is $y$ units. We know that $y=-6$.\n\nThe distance from $(x,y)$ to $(8,3)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(y-3)^2}$ units. We know that this distance is 15.\n\nSubstituting $y=-6$ into this equation, we get:\n\n$$\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x=2$$\n\nThe distance from $(x,y)$ to the origin is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ units.

        "ground_truth": "We know that $y=-6$ from the given information. By the distance formula, we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}=15$. Solving, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(x-8)^2+(-6-3)^2}&=15 \\\\\nx^2-16x+64+81&=225 \\\\\nx^2-16x-80&=0 \\\\\n(x-20)(x+4)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, $x+4=0$ or $x-20=0$, so $x=-4$ or $x=20$. $x=-4$ by the given conditions. Thus, our point is $(-4,-6)$ and is a distance of $\\sqrt{(-4)^2+(-6)^2}=\\sqrt{52}$ units from the origin. $n=\\boxed{52}$."
