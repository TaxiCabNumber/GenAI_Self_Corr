        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe ratio of two numbers is $3:5$. When 4 is subtracted from the lesser of the two numbers and 8 is added to the larger of the two, the new ratio is $2:7$. What is the greater of the two numbers before 8 is added to it?",
        "inference": "Let the numbers be $3x$ and $5x$.\nAccording to the question, we have,\n$$(3x-4):(5x+8)=2:7$$\n$$\\Rightarrow\\frac{3x-4}{5x+8}=\\frac{2}{7}$$\n$$\\Rightarrow7(3x-4)=2(5x+8)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow21x-28=10x+16$$\n$$\\Rightarrow21x-10x=16+28$$\n$$\\Rightarrow11x=44$$\n$$\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{44}{11}=4$$\nTherefore, the greater number before 8 is added to it is $5x=5\\times4=20$.\n**Final Answer: $\\\\boxed{20}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Let $a$ be the smaller of the two numbers and let $b$ be the larger of the two. Then $\\dfrac{a}{b}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$, so $5a=3b$. Additionally, $\\dfrac{a-4}{b+8}=\\dfrac{2}{7}$, so cross multiplying gives $7(a-4)=2(b+8)$. We now have a system of two linear equations; solving gives $a=12$, $b=20$. Since the question asks us for the value of $b$, our answer is $\\boxed{20}$."
