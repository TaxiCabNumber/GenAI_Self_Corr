        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $5a=-4b+5$ and $3a=-2b+3$, what is $6b$?",
        "inference": "Solution:\nWe can rewrite the given equations as $5a+4b=5$ and $3a+2b=3$.\nMultiplying the first equation by $3$ and the second equation by $5$, we get $15a+12b=15$ and $15a+10b=15$.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get $15a+12b-(15a+10b)=15-15$, which simplifies to $2b=0$.\nDividing both sides by $2$, we get $b=0$.\nTherefore, $6b=6(0)=\\boxed{0}$.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a&=-4b+5, \\\\\n3a&=-2b+3.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting two times the second equation from the first equation, we get $5a-2(3a)=-4b+5-2(-2b+3)$, which simplifies to $-a=-1$. So $a=1$ and plugging this into the first equation we obtain $5=-4b+5$. Solving for $b$, we find that $b=0$. Hence $6b=6\\cdot 0=\\boxed{0}$."
