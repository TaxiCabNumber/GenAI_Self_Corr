        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob can travel $m$ miles in $h$ hours on his bicycle. At this rate, how many hours would it take him to travel $h$ miles? Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $h$.",
        "inference": "Let's think step-by-step.\nLet t be the number of hours it takes Bob to travel h miles.\nWe know that the rate is m miles per h hours.\nThis means that in t hours, Bob will travel t * m miles.\nTherefore, we have: t * m = h.\nDividing both sides by m, we get: t = h / m.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{h/m}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since Bob travels $m$ miles in $h$ hours, he travels $m/h$ miles in 1 hour.  Therefore, in order to travel $h$ miles, he must travel for $h/(m/h) = \\boxed{\\frac{h^2}{m}}$ hours."
