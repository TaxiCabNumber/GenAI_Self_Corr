Therefore, we have\n\n$$36m(m-1/9)=0\\Rightarrow m=0\\text{ or }m=1/9.$$\n\nSince $m$ is positive, we have $m=1/9$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1/9}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Consider the quadratic formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since the quadratic has exactly one root, then its discriminant must be 0.
