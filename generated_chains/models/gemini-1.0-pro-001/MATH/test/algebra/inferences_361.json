At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve friends met for dinner at Oscar's Overstuffed Oyster House, and each ordered one meal. The portions were so large, there was enough food for 18 people. If they share, how many meals should they have ordered to have just enough food for the 12 of them?",
        "inference": "Each person ordered 1/12 of the total amount of food that was available. If they had only ordered enough food for 12 people, each person would have ordered 1/12 of that amount. So the ratio of the amount of food they ordered to the amount of food they should have ordered is 18/12 = 3/2. Therefore, they should have ordered 12 / (3/2) = 12 * 2/3 = 8 meals.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If 12 people order $\\frac{18}{12}=1\\frac{1}{2}$ times too much food, they should have ordered $\\frac{12}{\\frac{3}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3}\\times 12=\\boxed{8}$ meals."
