At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind all solutions to the equation $\\sqrt{3x+6}=x+2$.  If there are multiple solutions, order them from least to greatest, separated by comma(s).",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n\n$$(\\sqrt{3x+6})^2=(x+2)^2$$\n\n$$3x+6=x^2+4x+4$$\n\n$$x^2+x-2=0$$\n\nFactor the left side:\n\n$$(x-1)(x+2)=0$$\n\nSet each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:\n\n$$x-1=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x=\\boxed{1}$$\n\n$$x+2=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x=\\boxed{-2}$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{-2,1}.

        "ground_truth": "We square both sides to get rid of the square root. This gives $3x+6= (x+2)^2=x^2+4x+4$. Moving everything to one side, we get $x^2+x-2 = 0 = (x+2)(x-1)$. Solving, we get $ x = 1, -2$.\n\nWe plug both values back into the equation to see if either of them are extraneous.\n\nFor $x=1$, we get $\\sqrt{3 \\cdot 1+6}=1+2$, which works.\n\nFor $x=-2$, we get $\\sqrt{3 \\cdot -2+6}=-2+2$, which is also valid.\n\nTherefore, the answers are $\\boxed{-2}$ and $\\boxed{1}$."
