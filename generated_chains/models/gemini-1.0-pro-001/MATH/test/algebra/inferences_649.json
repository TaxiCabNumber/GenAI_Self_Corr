At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the sixth term in the geometric sequence $\\frac{27}{125}, \\frac{9}{25}, \\frac{3}{5},\\ldots$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe common ratio of the geometric sequence is $r = \\frac{9/25}{27/125} = \\frac{9/25 * 125/27}{1} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$.  Since the common ratio is $1$, every term in the sequence is the same as the previous term.  Therefore, the sixth term is the same as the fifth term, which is $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$. I hope it is correct.**",
