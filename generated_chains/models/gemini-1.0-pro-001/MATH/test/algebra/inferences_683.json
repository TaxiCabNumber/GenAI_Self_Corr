I hope it is correct.'\nA worker receives an annual wage of $\\$20{,}000$, which he always deposits into a savings account at the end of the year. By the end of the third year (when he makes the third deposit), he wants to have at least $\\$66,200$ in the account to finance the purchase of a house. What is the minimal compound interest rate that the savings account must provide? Express your answer as a percentage, but do not include the percent sign.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $r$ be the annual compound interest rate. \n\nAfter the first year, the amount in the account is $20,000(1+r)$. \n\nAfter the second year, the amount in the account is $20,000(1+r) + 20,000(1+r)^2$. \n\nAfter the third year, the amount in the account is $20,000(1+r) + 20,000(1+r)^2 + 20,000(1+r)^3$. \n\nWe want this amount to be at least $66,200, so we have the inequality: \n\n$$20,000(1+r) + 20,000(1+r)^2 + 20,000(1+r)^3 \\ge 66,200$$ \n\nDividing both sides by $20,000$, we get: \n\n$$(1+r) + (1+r)^2 + (1+r)^3 \\ge 3.31$$ \n\nExpanding the left side, we get: \n\n$$1 + 3r + 3r^2 + r^3 \\ge 3.31$$ \n\nSubtracting $3.31$ from both sides, we get: \n\n$$3r + 3r^2 + r^3 - 2.31 \\ge 0$$ \n\nFactoring, we get: \n\n$$(r-0.1)(3r^2 + 4.3r + 23.1) \\ge 0$$ \n\nThe first factor is negative for $r<0.1$, and the second factor is positive for all $r$. Therefore, the inequality is satisfied for $r\\ge 0.1$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{$10$}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "If the interest rate is $r$, it follows that $$20000(1+r)^2 + 20000(1+r) + 20000 \\ge 66200.$$ If we set $x = 1+r$ and divide through the inequality by $200$, it follows that $$100x^2 + 100x - 231 \\ge 0.$$ Since $231 = 11 \\cdot 21$, we can factor the quadratic as $(10x - 11)(10x + 21) \\ge 0$, so it follows that $x \\ge \\frac {11}{10}$ or $x \\le \\frac{-21}{10}$.
