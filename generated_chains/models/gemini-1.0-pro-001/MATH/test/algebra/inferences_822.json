        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSally has a bagful of candy. She arranges it into an $a$ by $b$ grid, but she has $2a+b$ candies leftover. Her big sister Rita comes along and says, \"I can do better than that!\" Rita neatly arranges the candies into a $5a-4$ by $\\frac{b-1}{3}$ grid and has none leftover. What is the maximum number of candies in Sally's bag?",
