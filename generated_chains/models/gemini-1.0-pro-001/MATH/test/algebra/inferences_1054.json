        "inference": "**Step 1:** Let $S$ be the sum of the series. Then,\n\n$$S=4+\\frac{12}{a}+\\frac{36}{a^2}+\\cdots=4+\\frac{12}{a}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{6}{a}}=\\frac{4a-48}{a-6}$$\n\n**Step 2:** Since $S$ is a perfect square, we must have $4a-48=k^2$ for some integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3:** Solving for $a$, we get $4a=48+k^2$.\n\n**Step 4:** Since $4a$ is divisible by $4$, $k^2$ must also be divisible by $4$. Thus, $k$ must be even, say $k=2m$ for some integer $m$.\n\n**Step 5:** Substituting $k=2m$ into the equation from Step 3, we get $4a=48+4m^2$.\n\n**Step 6:** Since $4a$ is divisible by $4$, $m^2$ must also be divisible by $4$. Thus, $m$ must be even, say $m=2n$ for some integer $n$.\n\n**Step 7:** Substituting $m=2n$ into the equation from Step 5, we get $4a=48+4(2n)^2=48+16n^2$.\n\n**Step 8:** Since $4a$ is divisible by $4$, $n^2$ must be even. Thus, $n$ must be even, say $n=2p$ for some integer $p$.\n\n**Step 9:** Substituting $n=2p$ into the equation from Step 7, we get $4a=48+16(2p)^2=48+64p^2$.\n\n**Step 10:** Since $4a$ is divisible by $4$, $p^2$ must be even. Thus, $p$ must be even, say $p=2q$ for some integer $q$.\n\n**Step 11:** Substituting $p=2q$ into the equation from Step 9, we get $4a=48+64(2q)^2=48+256q^2$.\n\n**Step 12:** Since $4a$ is divisible by $4$, $q^2$ must be odd.\n\n**Step 13:** The smallest possible value of $q^2$ is $1$. Thus, $q=1$ and $p=2$, $n=4$, $m=8$, $k=16$.\n\n**Step 14:** Substituting $k=16$ into the equation from Step 3, we get $4a=48+16^2=48+256=304$.\n\n**Step 15:** Thus, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $a=\\frac{304}{4}=\\boxed{76}$.\n\n**Final Answer: $76$**",
