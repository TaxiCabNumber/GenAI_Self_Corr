        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn Internet service provider allows a certain number of free hours each month and then charges for each additional hour used. Wells, Ted, and Vino each have separate accounts. This month the total hours used by Wells and Ted was 105, and each used all of their free hours. Their total cost was $\\$10$. Vino used 105 hours by himself and had to pay $\\$26$. What is the number of cents charged for each extra hour?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of extra hours and $y$ be the cost for each extra hour.\nFor Wells and Ted, the total number of hours used is $105$, and they each used all of their free hours, so the total number of extra hours used is $2x$. The total cost for Wells and Ted is $10$, so we have an equation:\n$$2y=10$$Solving for $y$, we get $y=5$.\n\nFor Vino, the total number of hours used is $105$, which includes $x$ extra hours, so we have an equation:\n$$x+y=26$$Substituting $y=5$, we get:\n$$x+5=26$$Solving for $x$, we get $x=21$.\n\nTherefore, the number of cents charged for each extra hour is $5\\times100=\\boxed{500}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{500}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let $f$ be the number of free hours per month, and let $c$ be the cost for each extra hour, in dollars.  Wells and Ted together have $2f$ free hours, so they used $105-2f$ extra hours.  Since the cost for each extra hour is $c$ dollars, we are given $c(105-2f)=10$.  Similarly, Vino's bill implies $c(105-f)=26$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we find $fc=16$.  Rewrite the second equation as $105c-fc=26$, substitute 16 for $fc$, and solve to get $c=2/5$.  Two-fifths of a dollar is $\\boxed{40}$ cents."
