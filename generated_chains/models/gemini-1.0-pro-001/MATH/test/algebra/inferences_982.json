At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$?",
        "inference": "First, we complete the square to put the expression in the form $(a+b)^2+c$:\n$$a^2+6a-7 = (a+3)^2-16$$\n\nThe minimum value of a squared expression is 0, which occurs when the expression inside the square is 0. Therefore, we set $a+3=0$ and solve for $a$:\n$$a+3=0$$\n$$a=-3$$\n\nPlugging this value of $a$ back into the original expression, we get:\n$$(-3)^2+6(-3)-7 = 9-18-7 = -16$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $\\boxed{-16}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-16}$.

        "ground_truth": "We begin by completing the square for $a^2 + 6a - 7.$ We know that the binomial to be squared will be in terms of $a+b$ because the exponent for $a^2$ is 1.\n\nBy expanding $(a+b)^2$, we get $a^2+2ba+b^2$. We get that $2ba=6a$, so $b=3$, and it follows that $(a+3)^2=a^2+6a+9$.\n\nTherefore, $a^2+6a-7=a^2+6a+9-16=(a+3)^2-16$. Since the square of a real number is at least zero, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is $0-16=\\boxed{-16}$."
