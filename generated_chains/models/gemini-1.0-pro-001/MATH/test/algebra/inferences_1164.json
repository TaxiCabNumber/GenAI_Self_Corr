        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ which satisfies the equation $|x+ y-7|+ |4x - y+ 12|= 0$?",
        "inference": "For these two absolute value expressions to be simultaneously equal to 0, both $x+ y-7$ and $4x - y + 12$ must equal 0. Solving for  $y$ in each of these gives\n$$y = 7 -x  \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad y = 4x - 12,$$respectively. Equating these two expressions yields\n$$\\begin{split} 7-x &= 4x - 12 \\\\\\  5x &= 19 \\\\\\ x &= \\frac{19}{5}. \\end{split}$$Substituting this back into either of the previous equations for  $y$ then gives\n$$y = 7 - \\frac{19}{5} = \\frac{8}{5}.$$Therefore, the ordered pair $$(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{19}{5},\\frac{8}{5} \\right)$$is the only solution to the given equation.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{19}{5},\\frac{8}{5} \\right)}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the absolute value of a number is always nonnegative, we must have that $x + y - 7 = 0$ and $4x - y + 12 = 0$.  Adding these equations together, we find $x = -1$.  Thus $y = 8$, and the desired answer is $\\boxed{(-1,8)}$."
