Therefore, either x or y must be 0.\n\nIf x = 0, then the integer is 0y, which is not a two-digit integer.\nIf y = 0, then the integer is x0, which is a two-digit integer.\n\nWe need to find the smallest x0 such that x0 = 2x * 0.\nSince x cannot be 0, the only possibility is x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest two-digit positive integer such that the product of its two digits is one-half the integer is 10.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$.
