At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs $(x,y)$ of positive integers is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $20$?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ and $y$ be two positive integers such that their harmonic mean is 20. Then, we have\n\n\n$$\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}} = 20 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{10} \\Rightarrow \\frac{x+y}{xy} = \\frac{1}{10} \\Rightarrow xy = 10(x+y) \\Rightarrow xy - 10x - 10y = 0.$$\n\nFactoring the left side, we get\n\n$$(x-10)(y-10) = 100.$$\n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, the only possible factors of 100 are $(1, 100), (2, 50), (4, 25), (5, 20), (10, 10)$. Solving each of these equations, we get the following ordered pairs:\n\n\n$$(x,y) = (11, 101), (12, 51), (14, 26), (15, 21), (20, 11).$$\n\nThere are $\\boxed{5}$ such ordered pairs.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$.

By Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, $$xy - 10(x+y) + 100 = (x-10)(y-10) = 100.$$Now, $100 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2$ has $(2 + 1) \\cdot (2+1) = 9$ factors, or we could simply list all of the possible factors: $\\{1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100\\}$.
