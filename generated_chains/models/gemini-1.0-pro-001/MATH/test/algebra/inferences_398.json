At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of seven consecutive integers is 49. What is the smallest of the seven integers?",
        "inference": "Let x be the smallest integer. Then the next six integers are x + 1, x + 2, x + 3, x + 4, x + 5, and x + 6.\n\nThe sum of these seven integers is 49, so we have:\n\nx + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6) = 49\n\nSimplifying the left side, we get:\n\n7x + 21 = 49\n\nSubtracting 21 from both sides, we get:\n\n7x = 28\n\nDividing both sides by 7, we get:\n\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the smallest of the seven integers is 4.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Let the smallest of these consecutive integers be $a-3$, and thus the largest will be $a+3$. The sum of all seven  integers is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, which is $7a = 49$. Thus, $a=7$. The smallest of the seven integers is $a-3=7-3=\\boxed{4}$."
