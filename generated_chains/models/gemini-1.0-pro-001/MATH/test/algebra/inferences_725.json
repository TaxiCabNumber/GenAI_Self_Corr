        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly $.500$. During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than $.503$. What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?",
        "inference": "Let $x$ be the number of matches the tennis player won before the weekend.\n\nBefore the weekend, her win ratio is $\\frac{x}{x+x}=\\frac{x}{2x}=0.500$.\n\nAfter the weekend, her win ratio is $\\frac{x+3}{x+3+1}=\\frac{x+3}{x+4}$.\n\nSince her win ratio is greater than $0.503$ after the weekend, we have $\\frac{x+3}{x+4}>0.503$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $x+4$, we get $x+3>0.503(x+4)$.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get $x+3>0.503x+2.012$.\n\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides, we get $3>0.503x+2.012$.\n\nSubtracting $2.012$ from both sides, we get $0.988>0.503x$.\n\nDividing both sides by $0.503$, we get $1.964>x$.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of matches the tennis player could've won before the weekend began is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.

        "ground_truth": "Let $n$ be the number of matches she won before the weekend began. Since her win ratio started at exactly .$500 = \\tfrac{1}{2},$ she must have played exactly $2n$ games total before the weekend began.
