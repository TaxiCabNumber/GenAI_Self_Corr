At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGiven that the point $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. What is the sum of coordinates of that point?",
        "inference": "The point $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{4}f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\\right)$, so we can substitute $x=16$ and $y=8$ into this equation to get\n\n$$8 = \\frac{1}{4}f(8).$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $4$, we get\n\n$$32 = f(8).$$\n\nTherefore, the point $(8,32)$ is on the graph of $y = f(x)$. The sum of the coordinates of this point is $8 + 32 = \\boxed{40}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{40}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Given that $(8,8)$ is on the graph of $y=\\frac 14f\\left(\\frac 12x\\right)$, we can substitute $8$ for both $x$ and $y$ in that equation to obtain $$8 = \\frac14f\\left(\\frac 12\\cdot 8\\right).$$We can rewrite this information as $$32 = f(4),$$which tells us that $(4,32)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(x)$. The sum of coordinates of this point is $\\boxed{36}$."
