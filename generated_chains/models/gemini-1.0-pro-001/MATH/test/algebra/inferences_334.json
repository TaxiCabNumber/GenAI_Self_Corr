At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFind a nonzero solution to the equation $\\sqrt{4c-5c^2} = 0$.",

I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "0 is the only number whose square root is 0, so we must have $4c-5c^2 = 0$.  Factoring gives $c(4-5c)=0$, so $c=0$ or $4-5c=0$.  Solving the latter equation gives $c=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$ as the only nonzero solution."
