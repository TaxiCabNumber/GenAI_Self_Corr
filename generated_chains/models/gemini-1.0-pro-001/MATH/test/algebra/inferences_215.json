        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $a+b=8$, $b+c=-3$, and $a+c= -5$, what is the value of the product $abc$?",
        "inference": "1. $a+b=8$\n2. $b+c=-3$\n3. $a+c= -5$\n\nAdding the 3 equations together we get:\n\n$2a+2b+2c=0$\n\nDividing both sides by 2 we get:\n\n$a+b+c=0$\n\nSo, $abc=a\\times(0)=0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Adding the first given equation to the second, we have $a+2b+c=5$. Then, subtracting the third given equation from this last equation, we get $2b=10$, so $b=5$. Plugging this value of $b$ into the first given equation, we find that $a=3$. Plugging this value of $a$ into the third given equation, we find that $c=-8$. Thus, the product $abc=3\\cdot5\\cdot-8=\\boxed{-120}$."
