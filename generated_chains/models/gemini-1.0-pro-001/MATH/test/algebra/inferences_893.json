        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf $n = 11$, then what is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot 2^{2n}$?",
        "inference": "$\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{n+1} \\cdot 2^{2n} = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{12} \\cdot 2^{22} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{2}}\\right)^{12} \\cdot 2^{22} = 2^{-24} \\cdot 2^{22} = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By simplifying exponents, we have $2^{2n} = 4^n$.  So, our overall expression is $\\frac{4^n}{4^{n+1}}$.  This simplifies to $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.  Throughout the course of this calculation, we did not have to plug in the value of 11 for $n$, but the answer may be similarly obtained with this substitution."
