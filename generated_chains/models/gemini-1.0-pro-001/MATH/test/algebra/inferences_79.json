        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA horse 64 feet from the center of a merry-go-round makes 27 revolutions. In order to travel the same distance, how many revolutions would a horse 16 feet from the center have to make?",
        "inference": "The distance traveled by a horse on a merry-go-round is directly proportional to the number of revolutions it makes.\n\nSo, if a horse 64 feet from the center makes 27 revolutions, then a horse 16 feet from the center would have to make:\n\n$$\\frac{16}{64} * 27 = 6.75$$\n\nrevolutions.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6.75}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The radius of the circular path of the horse closer to the center is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the radius of the path of the horse farther from the center.  Since circumference is directly proportional to radius, the length of shorter path is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the longer path.  Therefore, 4 times as many revolutions must be made to go the same distance, which is $27\\times4=\\boxed{108}$ revolutions."
