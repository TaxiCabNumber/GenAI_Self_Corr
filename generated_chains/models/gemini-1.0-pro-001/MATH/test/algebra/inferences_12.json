At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ in a coordinate system?",

Calculate the vertical distance from the origin to the $y$-coordinate of the point, $|0-6|=6$.\n3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the total distance, $\\sqrt{8^2+6^2}=\\sqrt{64+36}=\\sqrt{100}=10$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{10}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We use the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 36} = \\boxed{10}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nWe note that the origin, the point $(-8, 6)$, and the point $(-8, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse must be $\\boxed{10}$."
