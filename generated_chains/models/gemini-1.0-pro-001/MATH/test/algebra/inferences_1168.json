At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA circle is centered at $(5,15)$ and has a radius of $\\sqrt{130}$ units. Point $Q = (x,y)$ is on the circle, has integer coordinates, and the value of the $x$-coordinate is twice the value of the $y$-coordinate. What is the maximum possible value for $x$?",
        "inference": "The equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get $(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130$.\n\nSince $Q=(x,y)$ is a point on the circle, we can substitute its coordinates into the equation to get $(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130$\n\nWe are given that $x=2y$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get\n\n$$(2y-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130$$\n\nExpanding the square, we get\n\n$$4y^2-20y+25+y^2-30y+225=130$$\n\nCombining like terms, we get\n\n$$5y^2-50y+350=130$$\n\nSubtracting $130$ from both sides, we get\n\n$$5y^2-50y+220=0$$\n\nSolving for $y$ using the quadratic formula, we get\n\n$$y=\\frac{50\\pm\\sqrt{(-50)^2-4(5)(220)}}{2(5)}$$\n\n$$y=\\frac{50\\pm\\sqrt{2500-4400}}{10}$$\n\n$$y=\\frac{50\\pm\\sqrt{-1900}}{10}$$\n\n$$y=\\frac{50\\pm10i\\sqrt{19}}{10}$$\n\n$$y=5\\pm i\\sqrt{19}$$\n\nSince $y$ has integer coordinates, it must be equal to $5$.

        "ground_truth": "The equation of a circle centered at $(h,k)$ with radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$, so the equation of the circle is \\[\n(x-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130.\n\\] Since $x=2y$, we substitute to find  \\[\n(2y-5)^2+(y-15)^2=130.\n\\] Expanding the left-hand side and subtracting 130 from both sides, this equation becomes \\[\n5y^2 -50y+ 120=0.\n\\] The left-hand side of this equation factors as $5(y-6)(y-4)$, so $y=6$ and $y=4$ are the two possible $y$-coordinates.
