At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA TV screen measures 24 by 16 inches. If each dimension is increased by 20$\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Find the original area of the TV screen.\n\nOriginal area = length x width = 24 inches x 16 inches = 384 square inches\n\n**Step 2:** Find the new dimensions of the TV screen after a 20% increase.\n\nNew length = 24 inches + 20% of 24 inches = 24 inches + 4.8 inches = 28.8 inches\n\nNew width = 16 inches + 20% of 16 inches = 16 inches + 3.2 inches = 19.2 inches\n\n**Step 3:** Find the new area of the TV screen.\n\nNew area = new length x new width = 28.8 inches x 19.2 inches = 552.96 square inches\n\n**Step 4:** Find the percent increase in area.\n\nPercent increase = [(new area - original area) / original area] x 100%\n\nPercent increase = [(552.96 square inches - 384 square inches) / 384 square inches] x 100% = 44%\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{44%}.

        "ground_truth": "Since we're dealing with percentages, the actual dimensions do not matter. Let $l$ and $w$ represent the dimensions of the TV screen. The current area is $lw$. If we increase $l$ by $20\\%$, we end up with $l\\left(1+\\frac{20}{100}\\right)=l\\left(\\frac{10}{10}+\\frac{2}{10}\\right)=\\frac{12}{10}l$. Increasing the width results in $\\frac{12}{10}w$. The new area is $\\frac{12}{10}l\\times\\frac{12}{10}w=\\frac{144}{100}lw=lw\\left(1+\\frac{44}{100}\\right)$. The area increases by $\\boxed{44\\%}$."
