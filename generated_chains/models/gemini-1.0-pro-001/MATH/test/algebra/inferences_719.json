There are four pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  They are 1 and 15 (which give $k=16$), 3 and 5 (which give $k=8$), $-1$ and $-15$ (which gives $k=-16$), and -3 and -5 (which give $k=-8$).  The product of these four possible values of $k$ is \\begin{align*}\n(16)(8)(-16)(-8)& = (2^4)(2^3)(-2^4)(-2^3)\\\\\n& = 2^{4+3+4+3} \\\\&= 2^{14}\\\\& = 2^{10}\\cdot 2^4 = (1024)(16) = \\boxed{16384}.\n\\end{align*}"
