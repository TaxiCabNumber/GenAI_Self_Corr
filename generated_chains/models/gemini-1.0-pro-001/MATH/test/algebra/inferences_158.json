        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the maximum number of square inches in the area of a rectangle with a perimeter of 12 inches?",
        "inference": "Let \\(x\\) be the length of the rectangle and \\(y\\) be the width. Since the perimeter is 12 inches we have:\n\n$$x+x+y+y = 12$$\n\n$$2x+2y = 12$$\n\n$$x + y = 6$$\n\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\n$$A = xy$$\n\nWe want to maximize \\(A\\) subject to the constraint \\(x+y=6\\). We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to do this. Let\n\n$$F(x,y) = xy + \\lambda (x+y-6)$$\n\nThen the critical points are the solutions to the system of equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = y + \\lambda = 0$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = x + \\lambda = 0$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\lambda} = x+y-6 = 0$$\n\nFrom the first two equations we have \\(\\lambda = -x\\) and \\(\\lambda = -y\\). Setting these equal to each other we get \\(x=y\\). Substituting this into the third equation we get \\(x=y=3\\). Therefore, the maximum area is:\n\n$$A = xy = (3)(3) = 9$$\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the perimeter is 12, the sides of the rectangle add up to $12/2 = 6.$  Let $x$ be one side length of the rectangle.  Then the other side length is $6 - x,$ so the area is\n\\[x(6 - x) = 6x - x^2.\\]Completing the square, we get\n\\[-x^2 + 6x = -x^2 + 6x - 9 + 9 = 9 - (x - 3)^2.\\]Thus, the maximum area of the rectangle is $\\boxed{9}$ square inches, which occurs for a $3 \\times 3$ square."
