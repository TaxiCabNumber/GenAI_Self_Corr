        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nZeno had to paint a $15^\\prime \\times 15^\\prime$ square floor. He decided that each day he would paint half of the unpainted part from the previous day until there was only one square foot or less left, in which case he would stay and finish the job that day. Using this strategy, how many days did it take Zeno to paint the entire floor?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** On Day 1, Zeno paints half the floor, so $15 \\times 15 = 225$ sq ft remains unpainted.\n**Step 2:** On Day 2, Zeno paints half of the $225$ sq ft remaining, so $112.5$ sq ft remains unpainted.\n**Step 3:** On Day 3, Zeno paints half of the $112.5$ sq ft remaining, so $56.25$ sq ft remains unpainted.\n**Step 4:** This pattern continues, with the remaining area decreasing by half each day.\n**Step 5:** Zeno will keep painting until there is $1$ sq ft or less remaining. This will happen on the day when the remaining area is less than or equal to $1/2$ sq ft.\n**Step 6:** The remaining area after $n$ days is $(15 \\times 15) / 2^n$.\n**Step 7:** Therefore, the day when the remaining area is less than or equal to $1/2$ sq ft is the day when $n$ satisfies:\n```\n(15 \\times 15) / 2^n <= 1/2\n2^n >= (15 \\times 15) / (1/2) = 450\nn >= log_2(450)\nn >= 8.4509\n```\n**Step 8:** Since $n$ must be an integer, the day when the remaining area is less than or equal to $1/2$ sq ft is Day 9.\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{9}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We focus on the portion of the floor that is left unpainted. After one day, $\\frac12$ of the floor is left unpainted. After two days, $\\frac1{2^2}$ of the floor is left unpainted, and so on. After $n$ days, $\\frac1{2^n}$ of the floor is unpainted. The floor has area $15^2 = 225$ square feet, so we look for the least number of days $n$ when at most $\\frac1{225}$ of the floor is left unpainted: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac1{2^n} &\\leq \\frac1{225}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 2^n &\\geq 225\\\\\n\\Rightarrow n&\\geq8.\n\\end{align*} Thus, Zeno took $\\boxed{8}$ days to paint the floor."
