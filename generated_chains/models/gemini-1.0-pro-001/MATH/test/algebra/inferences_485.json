At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKim has exactly enough money to buy 40 oranges at $3x$ cents each. If the price rose to $4x$ cents per orange, how many oranges could she buy?",
        "inference": "Let $y$ be the number of oranges Kim can buy at the new price.\n\nThe total cost of 40 oranges at the old price of $3x$ cents each is $40 \\cdot 3x = 120x$ cents.\n\nThe total cost of $y$ oranges at the new price of $4x$ cents each is $y \\cdot 4x = 4xy$ cents.\n\nSince Kim has the same amount of money, we have $120x = 4xy$.\n\nDividing both sides by $4x$, we get $y = \\frac{120}{4} = 30$.\n\nTherefore, Kim can buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges at the new price.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{30}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If the total cost is fixed, then the relationship between cost per item and the number of items is inversely proportional.  Since each orange costs $\\frac{4}{3}$ as much, the same amount of money purchases $\\frac{3}{4}$ as many of them.  Taking three-fourths of 40, we find that Kim could buy $\\boxed{30}$ oranges."
