At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nOn the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$, how many points are there whose coordinates are both negative integers?",
        "inference": "The smallest possible value of $y$ on the graph is $-99$, which occurs when $x=-2$.  As $x$ increases, $y$ increases, so there are no points on the graph with $y<-99$.\n\nThe smallest possible value of $x$ on the graph is $-2$, which occurs when $y=-100$.  As $y$ increases, $x$ increases, so there are no points on the graph with $x<-2$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible points on the graph with both coordinates negative integers are $(-2,-100)$ and $(-1,-99)$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$.

        "ground_truth": "A point $(x,y)$ is on the graph if and only if $y=(x+2)^4-100$, so we seek to determine all pairs of negative integers $(x,y)$ which satisfy this equation. We can obtain pairs by plugging in $-1,-2,-3,$ and so on for $x$: \\begin{align*}\nx=-1 &\\Rightarrow y=1^4-100=-99 \\\\\nx=-2 &\\Rightarrow y=0^4-100=-100 \\\\\nx=-3 &\\Rightarrow y=(-1)^4-100=-99 \\\\\nx=-4 &\\Rightarrow y=(-2)^4-100=-84 \\\\\nx=-5 &\\Rightarrow y=(-3)^4-100=-19 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Starting at $x=-6$, the $y$-coordinates obtained in this way are positive. To be sure that there are no more solutions, we can solve the equation $$(x+2)^4-100 < 0,$$which yields $-2-\\sqrt[4]{100}<x<-2+\\sqrt[4]{100}$ (in decimals, this is roughly $-5.16<x<1.16$). Thus, the graph of $y=(x+2)^4-100$ passes through $\\boxed{5}$ points with negative integer coordinates."
