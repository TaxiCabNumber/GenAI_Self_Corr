        "inference": "The vertex of the parabola is at $(2,1)$, which means that $m+n=2\\Rightarrow m=2-n$. The parabola passes through $(-4,-3)$, which means that $a(-4)^2+b(-4)+c=-3\\Rightarrow 16a-4b+c=-3$. Since the zeros of the quadratic are at $x=m$ and $x=n$, the quadratic can be factored as $a(x-m)(x-n)$. Using the factored form, we can write the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-m)(x-n)$. Plugging in the point $(-4,-3)$, we get $-3=a(-4-m)(-4-n)$. Since $a\\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $a$ to get $-3/a=(4+m)(4+n)$. Since $m=2-n$, we can substitute $2-n$ for $m$ in the equation to get $-3/a=(4+(2-n))(4+n)$. Expanding the right side, we get $-3/a=(6-n)(4+n)$. Expanding further, we get $-3/a=24-10n+4n-n^2$. Rearranging, we get $n^2-14n+27=3/a$. Since the parabola opens downward, $a<0$, which means that $3/a<0$. Therefore, $n^2-14n+27<0$. Since the parabola passes through $(-4,-3)$, we know that $n>-4$. The only value of $n$ that satisfies both $n^2-14n+27<0$ and $n>-4$ is $n=3$. Therefore, $m=2-n=2-3=-1$. Thus, $m-n=2-3-(-1)=\\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,1)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=1$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2+1$. Now, substituting the other given point $(-4,-3)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n-3&=a(-4-2)^2+1\\\\\n-4&=a(-6)^2\\\\\n-4&=36a\\\\\n-\\frac{1}{9}&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=-\\frac{1}{9}(x-2)^2+1 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=9$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 3$, so $x=5$ or $x=-1$. Thus, $m=5$ and $n=-1$, so $m-n=5-(-1)=\\boxed{6}$."
