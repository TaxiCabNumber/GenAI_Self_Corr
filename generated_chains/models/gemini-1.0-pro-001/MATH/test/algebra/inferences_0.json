        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Factor the denominator to find the zeros.\n\n```\nx^2+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)\n```\n\n**Step 2**: The zeros are $x=-3$ and $x=2$.\n\n**Step 3**: The vertical asymptotes occur at the zeros of the denominator.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes."
