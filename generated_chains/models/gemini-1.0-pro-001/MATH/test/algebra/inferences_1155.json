At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the value of $y$ such that $\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15.5?$",
        "inference": "Since $y$ is less than 15.5, $\\lceil y\\rceil$ is 15. Thus, $\\lceil y\\rceil+y=15+y=15.5$, which means $y=15.5-15=\\boxed{0.5}.$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{0.5}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "First, it must be true that $y$ is positive because, otherwise, $\\lceil y\\rceil+y$ would be negative. Since $\\lceil y\\rceil$ is an integer, $0.5$ must be the decimal component of $y$. Therefore, $y$ can be rewritten as $x+0.5$. $\\lceil y\\rceil$ can then also be rewritten as $x+1$. The equation can then be written as $x+1+x+0.5=15.5$. $x$ must then equal $7$, and $y$ can only be $\\boxed{7.5}$."
