At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIf the point $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then there is one point which must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. What is the sum of that point's coordinates?",
        "inference": "Since $(2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we have $f(2)=9$.\n\nTherefore, the point $(-2,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, because $f(-2)=f(2)=9$.\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of $(-2,9)$ is $-2+9=\\boxed{7}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We know that $f(2)=9$. We can rewrite this as $f(-(-2))=9$, which shows that $(-2,9)$ must be on the graph of $y=f(-x)$. The sum of the coordinates of $(-2,9)$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nAlternatively, note that the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=f(-x)$ must be mirror images, with the $y$-axis being the axis of reflection. Thus, $(-2,9)$ is on the graph of $y=f(-x)$, and the sum of the coordinates of $(-2,9)$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
