The discriminant is:\n\n$$b^2 - 4ac = a^2 - 4(1)(5a) = a^2 - 20a.$$\n\nFor the discriminant to be a perfect square, it must be of the form $k^2$ for some integer $k$. Thus, we have:\n\n$$a^2 - 20a = k^2$$\n\n$$a^2 - 20a - k^2 = 0$$\n\n$$(a - k)(a + k) = 0$$\n\nTherefore, $a = k$ or $a = -k$. Since $a$ is an integer, $k$ must also be an integer. Thus, we have two cases:\n\n**Case 1:** $a = k$\n\nIn this case, the discriminant is $0$, which means that the equation has a unique integer solution of $x = -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\n**Case 2:** $a = -k$\n\nIn this case, the discriminant is $4k^2$, which means that the equation has two integer solutions: $x = \\frac{a}{2} + k$ and $x = \\frac{a}{2} - k$.\n\nTherefore, the equation $x^2 + ax + 5a = 0$ has integer solutions for $x$ for all integer values of $a$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\(\\boxed{all}\\).
