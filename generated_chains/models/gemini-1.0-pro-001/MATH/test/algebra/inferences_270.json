        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6. Four years ago,  Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In four years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{3}{5}$ of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now?",

        "ground_truth": "Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively.

We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, to get $b=\\frac{3}{5}(c)-4$. Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$ and $b$, we have  \\[[c-4]+[\\frac{3}{5}(c)-4]+c=18\\] Solving for $c$, we find that $c=10$.
