At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $h$ be a polynomial of degree $5$, and suppose that $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, where $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $b$.  Find $b$.",
        "inference": "Since $h(x) = (x^2-7x+10) \\cdot g(x)$, the degree of $h(x)$ is $2+b$.  Since the degree of $h(x)$ is $5$, we have $2+b = 5$, so $b = \\boxed{3}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Recall that for positive integers $a$ and $b$ $x^a x^b = x^{a+b}$.  Thus, if $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ are polynomials such that $h(x)=f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ and if $ x^a $ and $ x^b $ are the highest degree terms of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ then the highest degree term of $h(x)$ will be $x^{a+b}$.  In our case $f(x) = x^2-7x+10$, the highest degree term is $x^2$ and $h(x)$ has highest degree term $x^5$.  Thus, solving for $b$ in the equation $x^5 = x^2 x^b = x^{2+b}$, we find $b=\\boxed{3}$."
