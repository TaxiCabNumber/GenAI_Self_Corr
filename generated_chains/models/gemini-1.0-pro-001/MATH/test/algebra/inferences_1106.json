        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe $n^{\\text{th}}$ term of a certain geometric series is given by $a\\cdot r^{n-1}$, where $a$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is greater than 1. Bill picks out $k$ different numbers in this sequence, all of which have the same number of digits. What is the largest possible value of $k$?",
        "inference": "**Solution**\n\nFirst, we must find something that remains constant as $k$ varies. Lets say we pick $k$ index numbers $i_1,i_2,\\dots,i_k$. \n\nThen the $k$ numbers we choose are\n$$a\\cdot r^{i_1-1}, a\\cdot r^{i_2-1}, \\dots, a\\cdot r^{i_k-1} $$\n\nWe notice that each of these numbers have the same number of digits if and only if\n$$i_2-i_1 = i_3-i_2 = \\dots = i_k-i_{k-1}$$\n\nThe number of digits must be an integer, so the $i_j$'s must be consecutive. The largest possible value of $k$ occurs when they are as close together as possible, which is consecutive indices, so $i_j=j$ for $j=1,2,\\dots,k$.\n\nIn that case, \n$$i_k-i_1 = k-1$$\n\nand $k$ is the largest possible value.\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{k}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Suppose the smallest of Bill's numbers is $b$. The next few terms of the sequence are $br$, $br^2$, $br^3$, $br^4$, and so on. Since $r$ is at least 2, $br^4$ is at least $16b$. Since $16b > 10b$, and $10b$ has one more digit than $b$, $16b$ has more digits than $b$, and therefore $br^4$ has more digits than $b$. Since the series increases, $br^5$, $br^6$, and so on all have more digits than $b$. Therefore, Bill's numbers are restricted to $b$, $br$, $br^2$, and $br^3$; that is, he can have at most 4 numbers. An example of this is the sequence $1,\\,2,\\,4,\\,8,\\,16,\\ldots$, where Bill's numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Hence, the largest possible value of $k$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
