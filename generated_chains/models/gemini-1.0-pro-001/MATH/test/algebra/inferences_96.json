At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwelve people purchased supplies for a ten-day camping trip with the understanding that each of the twelve will get equal daily shares. They are then joined by three more people, but make no further purchases. How many days will the supplies last if the original daily share for each person is not changed?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nTwelve people for 10 days = 120 person-days\n\nTwelve people for x days = 120 person-days\n\n(12 + 3) people for x days = 120 person-days\n\n15 people for x days = 120 person-days\n\n$$x = \\frac{120}{15} = 8$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since each person of the original group had 10 daily shares, the total supplies are equivalent to 120 daily shares. When 3 people join the group, the total number of people becomes 15. Then each person in the new group will have $\\frac{120}{15}$ or 8 daily shares. The supplies will last $\\boxed{8}$ days."
