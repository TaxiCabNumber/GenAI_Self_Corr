At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe weight of $A$ is $40\\%$ greater than the weight of $B$ but $30\\%$ less than the weight of $C$. What is the ratio of the weight of $B$ to the weight of $C$ expressed as a common fraction?",
        "inference": "Let the weight of $B$ be $x$ kg.\nThen, the weight of $A$ is $1.4x$ kg and the weight of $C$ is $\\frac{x}{1-0.3} = \\frac{10}{7}x$ kg.\nTherefore, the ratio of the weight of $B$ to the weight of $C$ is: $$\\frac{x}{\\frac{10}{7}x} = \\frac{7}{10}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.

        "ground_truth": "We have $A=\\frac{140}{100}B=\\frac{70}{100}C$, or $A=1.4B=.7C$. Now we can solve for the ratio of $B$ to $C$. $$\\frac{B}{C}=\\frac{.7}{1.4}=\\frac{1}{2}$$ The ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac12}$."
