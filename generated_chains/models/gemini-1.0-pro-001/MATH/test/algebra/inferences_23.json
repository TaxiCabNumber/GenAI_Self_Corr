        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAt constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. I have some hydrogen in a 3.67 liter container with a pressure of 4 kPa. If I move all of it to a 1.835 liter container at the same temperature, what will the new pressure be in kPa?",
        "inference": "**Step 1:** Define the variables involved.\nLet P be the pressure (in kPa), and V be the volume (in liters).\n\n**Step 2:** Establish the relationship between P and V.\nSince the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume, we can write:\nP = k/V\nwhere k is a constant.\n\n**Step 3:** Find the value of k.\nUsing the given values, we can substitute P = 4 kPa and V = 3.67 liters into the equation:\n4 kPa = k/3.67 liters\nk = 4 kPa * 3.67 liters\nk = 14.68 kPa * liters\n\n**Step 4:** Calculate the new pressure.\nNow that we know the value of k, we can use the equation P = k/V to find the new pressure (P') in the 1.835 liter container:\nP' = k/V'\nP' = 14.68 kPa * liters / 1.835 liters\nP' = 8 kPa\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{8}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Since the pressure $p$ of the hydrogen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=3.67\\cdot4=14.68$. Consequently, when we move it to the 1.835 liter container, we get that $1.835p=14.68$, so $p=\\boxed{8}$ kPa."
