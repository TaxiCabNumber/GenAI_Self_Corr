        "ground_truth": "We rewrite the equation as $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 4y = -4$ and then complete the square, resulting in  $(x-3)^2-9 + (y+2)^2-4=-4$, or $(x-3)^2+(y+2)^2=9$. This is the equation of a circle with center $(3, -2)$ and radius 3, so the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi (3)^2 = \\boxed{9\\pi}$."
