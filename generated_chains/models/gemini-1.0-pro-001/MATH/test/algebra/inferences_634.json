        "inference": "The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of the variable in the polynomial. In this case, $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, so the highest exponent of the variable in $f(x)$ is 3. Similarly, $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5, so the highest exponent of the variable in $g(x)$ is 5.\n\nWhen we add two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the two polynomials. In this case, the maximum of 3 and 5 is 5. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $2f(x) + 4g(x)$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}.$ I hope it is correct.",
