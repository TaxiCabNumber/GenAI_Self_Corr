I hope it is correct.'\nThis graph shows the linear relationship between the time in seconds, $x$, for Caroline's walk and the distance in meters, $y$, Caroline is from her starting point. The graph passes through the point $(20,30)$. According to the graph, how many meters will Caroline walk in exactly one hour?

        "ground_truth": "Since the line goes through $(0, 0)$ and $(20, 30)$ we know that for every 20 seconds, Caroline goes 30 meters.  Thus in one minute (60 seconds), she goes $30 \\cdot 3 = 90$ meters.  This means that in one hour (60 minutes), she'll go $90 \\cdot 60 = \\boxed{5400}$ meters."
