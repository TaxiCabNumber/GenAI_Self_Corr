Therefore, $f(x)$ has an inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$ on $f(1) \\le f(x) \\le f(6)$. Since the graph of $f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x = 3$, $f(3)$ is the maximum value of $f(x)$ on $1 \\le x \\le 6$.

To say it another way, the maximum value of $f^{-1}(x)$ is the largest number in the domain of $f$."
