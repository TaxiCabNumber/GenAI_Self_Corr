        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many values of $x$ is the function $y=\\frac{x-2}{x^2-7x+10}$ not defined?",
        "inference": "The function is not defined when the denominator is equal to zero, that is, when $x^2-7x+10=0$. Factoring the denominator, we get $(x-2)(x-5)=0$, so the function is not defined when $x=2$ or $x=5$.  \n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By factoring the denominator, the equation becomes \\[y=\\frac{x-2}{(x-2)(x-5)}.\\]The function is not defined when the denominator is 0, which occurs at $x = 2$ and $x = 5$.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ values of $x$ for which the function is not defined."
