        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $t$ is greater than $2$ and less than $3.5$. How many integer values of $t$ satisfy this condition?",

        "ground_truth": "We have: $2 < \\sqrt{t} < \\frac{7}{2}$ so squaring the inequality (which we can do because all the terms in it are positive) gives us  $4 < t <\\frac{49}{4}=12.25$.  Therefore, $t$ is an integer between 5 and 12 inclusive, which leaves us with $\\boxed{8}$ possible integer values of $t$."
