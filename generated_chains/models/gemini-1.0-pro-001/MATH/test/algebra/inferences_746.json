At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFive people can mow a lawn in 12 hours.  How many more people are needed to mow the lawn in just 3 hours, assuming each person mows at the same rate?",
        "inference": "The work of mowing a lawn can be represented by the formula:\n\n```\nWork = Amount of work to be done = Rate of work * Time taken\n```\n\nSince all five people mow at the same rate, we can represent their individual rates of work as:\n\n```\nRate of each person = Work / Time = 1/12\n```\n\nTo mow the lawn in just 3 hours, we need to find the new rate of work:\n\n```\nNew rate of work = Work / New time = 1/3\n```\n\nThe difference between the new rate of work and the rate of each person represents the additional work rate needed:\n\n```\nAdditional work rate needed = New rate of work - Rate of each person = 1/3 - 1/12 = 1/4\n```\n\nSince one person's rate of work is 1/12, the additional work rate of 1/4 would require:\n\n```\nNumber of additional people = Additional work rate needed / Rate of each person = 1/4 / (1/12) = 3\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{3}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The number of people mowing and the time required to mow are inversely proportional. Letting $n$ be the number of people and $t$ be the amount of time, we have $nt = (5)(12)= 60$ because 5 people can mow a lawn in 12 hours. If $m$ people can mow the lawn in 3 hours, then we must have $m(3) = 60$, so $m=20$.  Therefore, we need to add $20-5 = \\boxed{15}$ people to the job."
