Each the time ball bounces, it rises to a height $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the previous height.  Find the total distance the ball travels, in feet.",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\n1. The ball drops 100 feet, so it travels 100 feet.\n\n2. The ball bounces to a height of $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot 100 = 40$ feet.  It then travels 40 feet to reach its peak height, and 40 feet to return to the ground.  Thus, it travels $40+40 + 40 = 120$ feet on this bounce.\n\n3. The ball bounces to a height of $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot 40 = 16$ feet.  It then travels 16 feet to reach its peak height, and 16 feet to return to the ground.  Thus, it travels $16+16+16 = 48$ feet on this bounce.\n\n4. The ball continues to bounce, each time traveling a total distance that is $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the previous distance.\n\n5. The total distance the ball travels is the sum of the distances it travels on each bounce:\n\n```\n100 + 120 + 48 + ...\n```\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term $a = 100$ and common ratio $r = \\frac{2}{5}$.  The sum of a geometric series is given by\n\n```\nS = \\frac{a} {1 - r}\n```\n\nIn this case,\n\n```\nS = \\frac{100} {1 - \\frac{2}{5}} = \\frac{100} {\\frac{3}{5}} = 166.66666666666666\n```\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{166.66666666666666}$ I hope it is correct.**",
