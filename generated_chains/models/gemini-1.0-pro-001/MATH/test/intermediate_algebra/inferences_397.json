        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the maximum degree of a polynomial of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^{n-i}$ with $a_i = \\pm 1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq n, 1 \\leq n$, such that all the zeros are real?",
        "inference": "Since the polynomial is $$\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^{n-i} = a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_n x^0 = x^n + x^{n-1} + \\cdots + 1,$$ we see that the polynomial has $n$ positive coefficients. By Descartes' rule of signs, a polynomial with $n$ positive coefficients has at most $n-1$ positive real zeros. Since all zeros are real, we conclude that the maximum degree of the polynomial is $n-1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{n-1}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The desired polynomials with $a_0 = -1$ are the negatives of those with $a_0 = 1,$ so consider $a_0 = 1.$  By Vieta's formulas, $-a_1$ is the sum of all the zeros, and $a_2$ is the sum of all possible pairwise products.  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the zeros of $x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_n$ is $a_1^2 - 2a_2.$  The product of the square of these zeros is $a_n^2.$\n\nLet the roots be $r_1$, $r_2$, $\\dots$, $r_n$, so\n\\[r_1^2 + r_2^2 + \\dots + r_n^2 = a_1^2 - 2a_2\\]and $r_1^2 r_2^2 \\dotsm r_n^2 = a_n^2$.\n\nIf all the zeros are real, then we can apply AM-GM to $r_1^2$, $r_2^2$, $\\dots$, $r_n^2$ (which are all non-negative), to get\n\n$$\\frac{a_1^2 - 2a_2}{n} \\geq (a_n^2)^{1/n},$$with equality only if the zeros are numerically equal.  We know that $a_i = \\pm 1$ for all $i$, so the right-hand side is equal to 1.  Also, $a_1^2 = 1$, so for the inequality to hold, $a_2$ must be equal to $-1$.  Hence, the inequality becomes $3/n \\ge 1$, so $n \\le 3$.  Now, we need to find an example of such a 3rd-order polynomial.\n\nThe polynomial $x^3 - x^2 - x + 1$ has the given form, and it factors as $(x - 1)^2 (x + 1)$, so all of its roots are real.  Hence, the maximum degree is $\\boxed{3}$."
