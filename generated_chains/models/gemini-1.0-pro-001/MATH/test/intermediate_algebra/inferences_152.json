At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by the polynomial $d(x)$ to give a quotient of $q(x)$ and a remainder of $r(x)$. If $\\deg f = 9$ and $\\deg r = 3$, what is the maximum possible value of $\\deg q$?",
        "inference": "The degree of the quotient is equal to the degree of the dividend minus the degree of the divisor plus the degree of the remainder.\n\nTherefore, $\\deg q = \\deg f - \\deg d + \\deg r = 9-(\\deg d) + 3$.\n\nSince the degree of the divisor is not given, we cannot determine the maximum possible value of $\\deg q$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\text{Cannot be determined}}$",
        "ground_truth": "We have $f(x) = d(x)q(x) +r(x)$. Since $\\deg f = 9$ and $\\deg r = 3$, we must have $\\deg q + \\deg d = 9$.  We know that in division $\\deg r < \\deg d$, which means that $\\deg d \\ge 4$. So\n$$\\deg q \\le 9-4 = \\boxed{5}.$$"
