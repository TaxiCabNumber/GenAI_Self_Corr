Find the side length of this equilateral triangle.",

Let the other two vertices of the triangle be $(x_0, y_0)$.\n\nSince the side length of an equilateral triangle is given by $s = \\sqrt{3}d$ where d is the length of the median, we need to find the length of the median.\n\nThe length of the median from vertex $(0,0)$ to side $\\overline{(x_0, y_0)(x_0, y_0)}$ is the distance from $(0,0)$ to the line $y = y_0$. This distance is given by $d = \\frac{|y - y_0|}{\\sqrt{1 + 0^2}} = |y - y_0|$.\n\nTherefore, the length of the side of the equilateral triangle is\n\n$$\\begin{split} s & = \\sqrt{3} d \\\\\\ & = \\sqrt{3} |y - y_0| \\\\\\ & = \\sqrt{3} |y_0| \\end{split}$$\n\nTo find $y_0$, we use the fact that the parabola passes through the point $(x_0, y_0)$.
