At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than $2$. If $f(1) = 2$ and $f(2) = 3$, find the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-1)(x-2)$.",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Using the Remainder Theorem, we can write:\n$$f(x) = q(x)(x-1)(x-2) + r(x)$$\nwhere $q(x)$ is the quotient polynomial and $r(x)$ is the remainder polynomial of degree less than 2.\n\n**Step 2**: Since $f(1) = 2$, we have:\n$$2 = f(1) = r(1) = r$$\nand since $f(2) = 3$, we have:\n$$3 = f(2) = r(2) = r$$\nTherefore, the remainder is $r = 2$.\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{2}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "Since $(x-1)(x-2)$ has degree $2$, we know the remainder has degree at most $1$, and thus is of the form $ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. Let $q(x)$ be the quotient. Then we have,\n$$f(x) = (x-1)(x-2)q(x)+ax+b.$$Substituting $x=1$ and $x=2$ gives us the equations:\n$$\\begin{aligned} f(1) &= 2 = a +b \\\\\nf(2) &= 3 = 2a+b \\end{aligned}$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $a=1$ and consequently, $b=1$. Hence the remainder is $\\boxed{x+1}$."
