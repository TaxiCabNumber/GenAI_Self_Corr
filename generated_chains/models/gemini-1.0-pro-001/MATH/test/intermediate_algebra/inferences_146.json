At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many functions are both even and odd?

The only function that satisfies both of these equations is the function $$f(x)=0$$ for all real numbers $x$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$. I hope it is correct.",
