        "ground_truth": "Since $f(x)$ has integer coefficients, the Integer Root Theorem tells us that all integer roots of $f(x)$ must divide the constant term $66=2\\cdot 3\\cdot 11$. Thus, the possible integer roots of $f(x)$ are\n$$\\pm 1,~\\pm 2,~\\pm 3,~\\pm 6,~\\pm 11,~\\pm 22,~\\pm 33,~\\pm 66.$$Moreover, since we know that all roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that all roots of $f(x)$ appear in the list above.\n\nNow we apply Vieta's formulas. The product of the roots of $f(x)$ is $(-1)^n\\cdot\\frac{a_0}{a_n}$, which is $33$ or $-33$. Also, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}=-\\frac{a_{n-1}}2$. Thus, in order to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we should make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible, working under the constraint that the product of the roots must be $33$ or $-33$.\n\nWe now consider two cases.\n\nCase 1 is that one of $33,-33$ is a root, in which case the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$.

Again, the only other possible roots are $\\pm 1$, so the absolute value of the sum of the roots is at least $11-3-1=7$, which is better than the result of Case 1. If the absolute value of the sum of the roots is $7$, then $|a_{n-1}|=7|a_n|=7\\cdot 2=14$.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $|a_{n-1}|\\ge 14$, and we can check that equality is achieved by\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) &= 2(x+11)(x-3)(x-1) \\\\\n&= 2x^3+14x^2-82x+66,\n\\end{align*}which has integer coefficients and integer roots.
