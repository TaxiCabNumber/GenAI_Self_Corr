        "inference": "We know that $\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}}$ is a root of $P(x)$, so $P(\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{6}})=0$.\n\nSquaring both sides, we get $P^2(1+\\sqrt{6})=0$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ has rational coefficients, so does $P^2(x)$.\n\nThus, $P^2(1+\\sqrt{6})$ has a rational root.\n\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational roots of $P^2(1+\\sqrt{6})$ are $\\pm1$.\n\nSince $P^2(1+\\sqrt{6})$ is nonnegative, its only rational root is $1$.\n\nThus, $P(1+\\sqrt{6})=\\pm1$.\n\nSince $P(x)$ has leading coefficient $1$, $P(x)$ is either increasing or decreasing on the interval $[1,1+\\sqrt{6}]$.\n\nThus, $P(1)\\neq P(1+\\sqrt{6})$.\n\nTherefore, $P(1)=-1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-1}$.
