        "inference": "**Solution:**\nThe area of the circular sector is $A = \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\theta$.  The perimeter of the circular sector is $P = r + r\\theta$.  Since the perimeter is fixed, we have $P = 2\\pi r = r + r\\theta$, so $r\\theta = 2\\pi r - r$.  Substituting this into the area formula, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}r^2 (2\\pi r - r) = r^3 (\\pi  -  \\frac{1}{2})$.  To maximize the area, we take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $r$ and set it equal to zero: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dA}{dr} &= \\frac{d}{dr} [r^3 (\\pi - \\frac{1}{2})] \\\\\n&= 3r^2 (\\pi - \\frac{1}{2}) \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{align*}Solving this equation, we get $r = 0$.
