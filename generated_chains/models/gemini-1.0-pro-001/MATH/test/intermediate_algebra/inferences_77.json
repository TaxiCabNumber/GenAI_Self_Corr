Suppose that $P(x)$ has remainder $R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4),$ and remainder $2R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3).$  Given that $P(0) = 5,$ find $P(5).$",

Similarly, since $P(x)$ has remainder $2R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3)$, we have $$P(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x),$$ where $Q_2(x)$ is some polynomial.  Setting $x = 0$ in the first equation, we get $$P(0) = R(0) = 5.$$  Setting $x = 5$ in the second equation, we get $$P(5) = 2R(5) = 2(P(5) - 5(5 - 2)(5 - 3)) = 2(P(5) - 40).$$  Therefore, $$P(5) = \\boxed{100}.$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{100}.$ I hope it is correct.",
