At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sum of the following seven numbers is exactly 19: $a_1 = 2.56,$ $a_2 = 2.61,$ $a_3 = 2.65,$ $a_4 = 2.71,$ $a_5 = 2.79,$ $a_6 = 2.82,$ $a_7 = 2.86.$ Each $a_i$ is approximated by some integer $A_i,$ for $1 \\le i \\le 7,$ such that the sum of the $A_i$'s is also $19.$ Let $M$ be the maximum of the seven \"errors\" $|A_i - a_i|.$ What is the smallest possible value of $M$?",
