At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $a$, $b$, and $c$ be three distinct one-digit numbers. What is the maximum value of the sum of the roots of the equation $(x-a)(x-b)+(x-b)(x-c)=0$?",

Then, we have\n\n$$r_1+r_2=a+b+c$$\n\nand\n\n$$r_1r_2=ab+bc+ca$$\n\nSince $a,b,c$ are distinct one-digit numbers, we have $a+b+c\\le27$ and $ab+bc+ca\\le81$.
