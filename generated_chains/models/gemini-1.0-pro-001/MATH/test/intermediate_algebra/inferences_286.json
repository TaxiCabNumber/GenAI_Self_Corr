At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "ground_truth": "For $x \\le 0,$ the expression $x^2$ takes all nonnegative values. Meanwhile, for $x > 0,$ the expression $x^3$ takes all positive values, so $x^3 - 5$ takes all values in the interval $(-5, \\infty).$ It follows that the range of $f(x)$ is the union of the two intervals $[0, \\infty)$ and $(-5, \\infty).$ Because the second interval contains the first one, the range of $f(x)$ is simply $\\boxed{(-5, \\infty)}.$"
