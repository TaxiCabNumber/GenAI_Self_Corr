        "inference": "We have that $a_1+g_1=0$, $a_2+g_2=0$, $a_3+g_3=1$, and $a_4+g_4=0$.  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $a_2-a_1=g_2-g_1$.  Subtracting the first equation from the third, we get $a_3-a_1=g_3-g_1$.  Subtracting the first equation from the fourth, we get $a_4-a_1=g_4-g_1$.  Thus, $a_2-a_1=a_3-a_1=a_4-a_1$.  This means that $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d=a_2-a_1$.  Similarly, we can show that $\\{g_n\\}$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $r=g_2/g_1$.  Since $a_1+g_1=0$, we have $g_1=-a_1$.  Since $a_1+g_2=0$, we have $g_2=-a_2=-(a_1+d)=-a_1-d$.
