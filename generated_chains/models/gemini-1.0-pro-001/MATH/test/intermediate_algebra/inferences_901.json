I hope it is correct.'\nGiven a real number $x$, let $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ denote the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For a certain integer $k$, there are exactly 70 positive integers $n_1$, $n_2, \\ldots,$ $n_{70}$ such that\n\\[k = \\lfloor \\sqrt[3]{n_1} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\sqrt[3]{n_2} \\rfloor =\\cdots= \\lfloor \\sqrt[3]{n_{70}} \\rfloor\\]and $k$ divides $n_i$ for all $i$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq 70$.\n\nFind the maximum value of $\\displaystyle\\frac{n_i}{k}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq 70$.",
