I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of positive integers with $a_1 = 1$ and $a_9+a_{10}=646$ is formed so that the first three terms are in geometric progression, the second, third, and fourth terms are in arithmetic progression, and, in general, for all $n\\ge1$, the terms $a_{2n-1}$, $a_{2n}$, and $a_{2n+1}$ are in geometric progression, and the terms $a_{2n}$, $a_{2n+1}$, and $a_{2n+2}$ are in arithmetic progression. Let $a_n$ be the greatest term in this sequence that is less than 1000.  Find $n+a_n$.",
