        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nWe can expand the expression $f(x) + g(x)$ as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nf(x) + g(x) &= x^2 + bx + 9 + x^2 + dx + e \\\\\n&= 2x^2 + (b+d)x + (9+e).\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $f(x) = 0$ has roots $r$ and $s$, we know that $r + s = -b$ and $rs = 9$. Similarly, since $g(x) = 0$ has roots $-r$ and $-s$, we know that $(-r) + (-s) = -d$ and $(-r)(-s) = e$. We can use these facts to solve for $b$, $d$, $e$, and then plug these values into the expression for $f(x) + g(x)$ to find its roots.\n\nFirst, we solve for $b$ and $d$:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nr + s &= -b \\\\\n-r - s &= -d.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nAdding these two equations, we get $2(-s) = -d \\Rightarrow d = -2s$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $-r - s = -(-2s) \\Rightarrow r = s$. Therefore, $b = -2r$.\n\nNext, we solve for $e$:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nrs &= 9 \\\\\n(-r)(-s) &= e.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSince $r = s$, we have $(-r)(-s) = r^2 = 9 \\Rightarrow e = 9$.\n\nFinally, we plug these values into the expression for $f(x) + g(x)$:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nf(x) + g(x) &= 2x^2 + (b+d)x + (9+e) \\\\\n&= 2x^2 + (-2r-2s)x + (9+9) \\\\\n&= 2x^2 - 4rx + 18 \\\\\n&= 2(x^2 - 2rx + 9) \\\\\n&= 2(x-r)^2 \\\\\n&= 2r^2 - 4rx + 2x^2 \\\\\n&= 2(r^2 - 2rx + x^2) \\\\\n&= 2(r-x)^2.\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nTherefore, the roots of $f(x) + g(x) = 0$ are $x = r$ and $x = r$.\n\n**Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$r, r$}.
