At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSuppose $x \\in [-5,-3]$ and $y \\in [2,4]$. What is the largest possible value of $\\frac{x+y}{x-y}$?",

Therefore, the maximum value of $x+y$ is $-3+4 = 1$.\n\nMinimum value of $x-y$:\n- The minimum value of $x$ is $-5$ and the minimum value of $y$ is $2$, so $x-y$ is minimized when $x=-5$ and $y=2$.
