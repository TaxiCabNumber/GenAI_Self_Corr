Since the sum of the numbers on her list is equal to the sum of the squares of the numbers on her list, we have\n\n$$a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_n^2.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as\n\n$$(a_1 - a_1^2) + (a_2 - a_2^2) + \\cdots + (a_n - a_n^2) = 0.$$\n\nSince $a_1 - a_1^2 \\le 0$ for all $a_1$, $a_2 - a_2^2 \\le 0$ for all $a_2$, $\\ldots$, $a_n - a_n^2 \\le 0$ for all $a_n$, the left-hand side of this equation is non-positive.
