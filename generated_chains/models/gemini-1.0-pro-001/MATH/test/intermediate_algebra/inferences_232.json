        "inference": "**Solution:**\nFirst, we can rewrite the equation as \\[|x(x-5)| = 3.\\]\n\n**Case 1**: $x(x-5) \\geq 0$. This implies that $x$ and $x-5$ have the same sign. Since $|x(x-5)| = 3$, we have $x(x-5) = 3$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3$ or $x = 2$.\n\n**Case 2**: $x(x-5) < 0$. This implies that $x$ and $x-5$ have opposite signs. Since $|x(x-5)| = 3$, we have $x(x-5) = -3$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ or $x = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all real solutions is $3 + 2 + \\frac{3}{2} + 6 = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$.

        "ground_truth": "Rewriting the left-hand side, we get \\[|x(x-5)| = 3.\\]Therefore, either $x(x-5) =3$ or $x(x-5) = -3.$ These are equivalent to $x^2-5x-3=0$ and $x^2-5x+3=0,$ respectively. The discriminant of both quadratic equations is positive, so they both have two real roots for $x.$ By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of each quadratic is $5,$ so the sum of all four roots is $5+5=\\boxed{10}.$"
