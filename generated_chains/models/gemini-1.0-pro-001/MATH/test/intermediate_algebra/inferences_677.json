At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe function $f(x) = -3x^2 + 36x - 7,$ defined for all real numbers, does not have an inverse.  However, when its domain is restricted to $x \\in [c,\\infty),$ the function does become invertible, for certain values of $c.$  What is the smallest such value of $c$?",
        "inference": "Since $f(x) = -3x^2 + 36x - 7$ is increasing on the interval $[c, \\infty),$ it is one-to-one and therefore invertible on that interval.  We know that $f(x)$ is increasing when $f'(x) > 0.$  So we solve the following inequality to find the smallest value of $c$ such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\geq c$\n\n$$f'(x) = -6x + 36 > 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad -6x > -36 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad x < 6.$$\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $c$ for which $f(x)$ is invertible on the interval $[c, \\infty)$ is $c = \\boxed{6}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}.$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "We can complete the square, to get $f(x) = 101 - 3(x - 6)^2.$  Thus, the graph of $f(x)$ is a parabola with axis of symmetry $x = 6,$ so the smallest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{6}.$"
