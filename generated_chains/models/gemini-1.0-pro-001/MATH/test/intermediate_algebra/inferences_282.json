At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor which value of $x$ does the function $f(x) = \\frac{2x-6}{x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6}$ cross its horizontal asymptote?",
        "inference": "To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to look at the highest degree in the denominator and numerator. In this case, the denominator has a degree of 3, while the numerator has a degree of 1. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is $y=0$.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ at which the function crosses its horizontal asymptote, we need to set $f(x)=0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2x-6}{x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6} &= 0\\\\\n2x-6 &= 0\\\\\n2x &= 6\\\\\nx &= 3\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{x=3}$.

        "ground_truth": "The horizontal asymptote is the horizontal line that $f$ approaches as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree of the numerator, it follows that the horizontal asymptote occurs at the line $y = 0$. Setting this equal to $f(x)$, $$\\frac{2x-6}{x^3 - 7x^2 - 2x + 6} \\Longrightarrow 2x-6 = 0.$$Thus, $x = \\boxed{3}$."
