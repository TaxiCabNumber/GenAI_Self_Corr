At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the rational function $\\frac{q(x)}{x^6-4x^5+3x^3+x^2-1} $ has a horizontal asymptote. What is the largest possible degree of $q(x)$?",
        "inference": "As $x \\to \\infty$,\n$$x^6-4x^5+3x^3+x^2-1\\to\\infty$$\n\nSo the numerator degree must be less than the denominator degree for a horizontal asymptote. Therefore, the largest possible degree of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the given function to have a horizontal asymptote, it can't go to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity. This is only possible if the numerator has the same or smaller degree than the denominator. Since the denominator has degree 6, the largest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will allow the function to have a horizontal asymptote is $\\boxed{6}.$\n\nTo see that a degree of $6$ works, we can consider $q(x) = x^6.$ Then as $x$ grows away from $0,$ the $x^6$ terms in the function will dominate and the function will tend towards $\\frac{x^6}{x^6} = 1.$"
