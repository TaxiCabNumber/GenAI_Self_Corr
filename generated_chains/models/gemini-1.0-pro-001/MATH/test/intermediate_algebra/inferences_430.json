        "inference": "**Solution:**\nIf $i - 3$ is a root, then $x - (i - 3) = x - i + 3$ is a factor of $ax^3 + 9x^2 + ax - 30$.

Expanding the right side and equating coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$, we get\n\n$$9 = b \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad a = b + d.$$\n\nSince $b = 9$, we have $a = 9 + d$.\n\nSimilarly, since $b$ is a root, $x - b$ is a factor of $ax^3 + 9x^2 + ax - 30$. By the Factor Theorem,\n\n$$ax^3 + 9x^2 + ax - 30 = (x - b)(ex^2 + fx + g)$$\n\nfor some real numbers $e$, $f$, and $g$. Expanding the right side and equating coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$, we get\n\n$$9 = e \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad a = e + g.$$\n\nSince $e = 9$, we have $a = 9 + g$.\n\nTherefore, we have two equations for $a$:\n\n$$a = 9 + d \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad a = 9 + g.$$\n\nEquating the right sides, we get $d = g$.\n\nThus,\n\n$$a + b = (9 + d) + 9 = 18 + d = \\boxed{18}.$$\n\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{18}.
