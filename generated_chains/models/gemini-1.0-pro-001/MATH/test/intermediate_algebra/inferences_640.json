At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor how many ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ of nonnegative integers less than $20$ are there exactly two distinct elements in the set $\\{i^x, (1+i)^y, z\\}$, where $i^2 = -1$?",
        "inference": "First of all, $i^x = -1$ if and only if $x$ is odd. Thus there are $10$ triples $(x,y,z)$ with $\\{i^x, (1+i)^y, z\\} = \\{-1, (1+i)^y, z\\}$.\n\nIf $x$ is even, then $i^x = 1$. In this case, $z \\neq 1$, since $\\{1, (1+i)^y, z\\}$ would not contain two distinct elements. Therefore, there are $8$ triples $(x,y,z)$ with $\\{i^x, (1+i)^y, z\\} = \\{1, (1+i)^y, z\\}$.\n\nFinally, if $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, then $(1+i)^y = 1$. Thus there are $5$ triples $(x,y,z)$ with $\\{i^x (1+i)^y, z\\} = \\{-1, z\\}$.\n\nAdding these numbers, we get that there are a total of $10 + 8 + 5 = 23$ triples $(x,y,z)$ with $\\{i^x, (1+i)^y, z\\}$ containing exactly two distinct elements.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{23}.

        "ground_truth": "We divide into cases.\n\nCase 1: $i^x = (1 + i)^y \\neq z.$\n\nNote that $|i^x| = |i|^x = 1$ and $|(1 + i)^y| = |1 + i|^y = (\\sqrt{2})^y,$ so we must have $y = 0.$  Then $i^x = 1$ only when $x$ is a multiple of 4.  There are 5 possible values of $x$ (0, 4, 8, 12, 16), and 19 possible values of $z,$ so there are $5 \\cdot 19 = 95$ triples in this case.\n\nCase 2: $i^x = z \\neq (1 + i)^y.$\n\nThe only way that $i^x$ can be a nonnegative integer is if it is equal to 1, which in turn means that $x$ is a multiple of 4.  As in case 1, $|(1 + i)^y| = (\\sqrt{2})^y,$ so $(1 + i)^y \\neq 1$ is satisfied as long as $y \\neq 0.$  This gives us 5 possible values of $x,$ and 19 possible values of $y,$ so there are $5 \\cdot 19 = 95$ triples in this case.\n\nCase 3: $(1 + i)^y = z \\neq i^x.$\n\nNote that $(1 + i)^2 = 2i,$ and we must raise $2i$ to a fourth power to get a nonnegative integer.  Hence, $(1 + i)^y$ is a nonnegative integer only when $y$ is a multiple if 8.  Furthermore, $(1 + i)^8 = (2i)^4 = 16,$ and $(1 + i)^{16} = 16^2 = 256,$ so the only possible values of $y$ are 0 and 8.\n\nFor $y = 0,$ $z = 1,$ and then $x$ cannot be a multiple of 4.  This gives us $20 - 5 = 15$ triples.\n\nFor $y = 8,$ $z = 16,$ and $x$ can take on any value.  This gives us 20 triples, so there are $15 + 20 = 35$ triples in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $95 + 95 + 35 = \\boxed{225}$ triples."
