At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y = \\frac{1}{x^3-3x^2+3x-1}$ have?",
        "inference": "The graph has vertical asymptotes at $x$ where the denominator is equal to zero. We can find the values of $x$ by setting $x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = 0$. We can solve this equation by factoring:\n\n$$x^3-3x^2+3x-1 = 0$$\n\n$$(x-1)^3 = 0$$\n\n$$x-1 = 0$$\n\n$$x = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the graph has one vertical asymptote at $x = 1$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1}$.
