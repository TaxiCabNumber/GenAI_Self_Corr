At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nConsider the two functions $f(x) = x^2 + 2bx + 1$ and $g(x) = 2a(x + b),$ where the variables $x$ and the constants $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Each such pair of constants $a$ and $b$ may be considered as a point $(a,b)$ in an $ab$-plane.  Let $S$ be the set of points $(a,b)$ for which the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ do not intersect (in the $xy$-plane).  Find the area of $S.$",
