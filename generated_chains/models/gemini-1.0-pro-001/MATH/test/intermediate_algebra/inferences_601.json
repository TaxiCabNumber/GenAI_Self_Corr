Every root of $f(x)$ is also a root of $g(x)$. What is the third root of $g(x)$ (that is not a root of $f(x)$)?",
        "inference": "Since every root of $f(x)$ is also a root of $g(x)$, we can use polynomial division to find the quotient $q(x)$ and the remainder $r(x)$ when $g(x)$ is divided by $f(x)$.\n\nUsing long division or synthetic division, we have:\n\n\n```\n -2x^2 - 3x - 6\n-2x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 12\n-x^2 + 3x + 4\n-------------------------\n-2x^3 + 6x^2    0\n```\n\nSo, $q(x) = -2x^2 - 3x - 6$.

Therefore, the third root of $g(x)$ (that is not a root of $f(x)$) is the same as the only root of $r(x)$.\n\nTo find the root of $r(x)$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n```\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n```\n\nwhere $a=-2, b=-3$, and $c=-6$.\n\n```\nx = (-(-3) \u00b1 \u221a((-3)^2 - 4(-2)(-6))) / 2(-2)\nx = (3 \u00b1 \u221a(9 + 48)) / -4\nx = (3 \u00b1 \u221a57) / -4\n```\n\nSo, the third root of $g(x)$ (that is not a root of $f(x)$) is $\\boxed{\\frac{3 + \u221a57}{-4}}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{3 + \u221a57}{-4}}$.
