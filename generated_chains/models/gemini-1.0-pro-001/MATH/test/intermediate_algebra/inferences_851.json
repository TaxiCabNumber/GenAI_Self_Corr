Suppose that there is a circle which passes through $F_1$ and $F_2$ and which lies tangent to the ellipse at two points on the $x$-axis. Compute $k.$",

The circle is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the $x$-axis, so its center is at the midpoint of $F_1$ and $F_2$, which is at $(0,0)$. The radius of the circle is $r = \\sqrt{c^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{1-1/k+1}=\\sqrt{k-1/k}$. Since $F_1 = (-\\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0) = (-\\sqrt{1-1/k},0)$ and $F_2 = (\\sqrt{a^2-b^2},0) = (\\sqrt{1-1/k},0)$, the distance between $F_1$ and $F_2$ is $2\\sqrt{a^2-b^2} = 2\\sqrt{1-1/k}.$ Since the circle passes through $F_1$ and $F_2$, the distance between the center of the circle and $F_1$ is $r - c = \\sqrt{k-1/k} - \\sqrt{1-1/k} = (\\sqrt{k} - 1)/\\sqrt{k}$.
