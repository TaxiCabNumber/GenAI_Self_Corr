At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhich type of conic section is described by the equation \\[x^2 - 4y^2 = -8(y-1)^2 + 2x?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",

To determine which, we need to look at the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$. If they have the same sign, the conic is an ellipse. If they have opposite signs, the conic is a hyperbola. In this case, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ have opposite signs, so the conic is a hyperbola.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$H$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The left-hand side contains $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms with opposite signs. But be careful! The right-hand side, when expanded, contains the term $-8y^2,$ and so when all the terms are moved to the left-hand side, the terms $x^2$ and $4y^2$ will appear. Because the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ are of the same signs but unequal, this conic section is an $\\boxed{(\\text{E})}$ ellipse."
