At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo non-decreasing sequences of nonnegative integers have different first terms. Each sequence has the property that each term beginning with the third is the sum of the previous two terms, and the seventh term of each sequence is $N$. What is the smallest possible value of $N$?",
        "inference": "**Solution:**\nLet $a_1$, $a_2$, and $b_1$, $b_2$ be the first two terms of the sequences, respectively. Then, the third term of each sequence is $a_1+a_2$, and the seventh term is $a_1+6(a_1+a_2)=7a_1+6a_2$. Similarly, the seventh term of the second sequence is $7b_1+6b_2$. Since both seventh terms are $N$, we have $7a_1+6a_2=7b_1+6b_2$. Since $a_1$ and $b_1$ are different, we must have $a_2 \\neq b_2$. Thus, the only way for the seventh terms to be equal is if $a_1=b_1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $N$ is $7a_1+6a_2=13a_1$, which occurs when $a_1$ is the smallest possible nonnegative integer, namely $0$.\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{0}$.
