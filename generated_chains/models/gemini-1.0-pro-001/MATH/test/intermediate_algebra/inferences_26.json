Vieta's formulas state that the sum of the roots is $-a_3$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is $a_2$, the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is $-a_1$, and the product of all the roots is $4$.\nSince the polynomial has integer coefficients, its roots must be rational. Therefore, the possible integer roots are the factors of $4$.\nThe factors of $4$ are $1, 2, 4$. Therefore, the possible integer roots of the polynomial are $1, 2, 4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1, 2, 4}$. I hope it is correct.",
