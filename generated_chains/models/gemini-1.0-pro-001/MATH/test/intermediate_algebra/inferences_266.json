        "inference": "Let $Q(x)=P(x)-(x+3)$. Then $Q(17)=10-(17+3)=10-20=-10$, and $Q(24)=17-(24+3)=17-27=-10$. Thus, $Q(x)$ is a constant polynomial, so $P(x)=x+3$. Now, we need to find two distinct integer solutions to $x+3=n$. This is equivalent to $x=n-3$. Thus, we need to find two distinct integers $n$ such that $n-3$ is an integer. We can solve this by letting $n-3=k$, where $k$ is an integer. Then, we have $n=k+3$. Thus, we need to find two distinct integers $k$ such that $k+3$ is an integer. We can solve this by letting $k=m-3$, where $m$ is an integer. Then, we have $n=(m-3)+3=m$. Thus, we need to find two distinct integers $m$ such that $m$ is an integer. Any two distinct integers will suffice, so we can choose $m=1$ and $m=2$. Then, we have $n_1=1$ and $n_2=2$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1, 2}$. I hope it is correct.",
