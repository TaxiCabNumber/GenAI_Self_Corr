At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "**Solution:**\n\nSince the graph has a hole at $x=-5$, the numerator and denominator have a common factor of $(x+5)$. Therefore, the denominator must be equal to $(2x^2+7x-c)=2(x+5)(x+k)$, where $k$ is some constant. To find the equation of the vertical asymptote, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $x$:\n\n$$2(x+5)(x+k)=0$$\n\n$$x=-5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x=-k$$\n\nSince $x=-5$ is the hole, the vertical asymptote must be $x=-k$. Therefore, the equation of the vertical asymptote is:\n\n**Final Answer: $\\boxed{x=-k}$. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "We can factor the numerator to get $$\\frac{3x^2+16x+5}{2x^2+7x-c} = \\frac{(x+5)(3x+1)}{2x^2+7x-c}.$$Since there is a hole at $x=-5$ (rather than an asymptote), we must have a factor of $x+5$ in the denominator that cancels out with the corresponding factor in the numerator. So by the Factor theorem,\n$$2(-5)^2+7(-5)-c = 0$$which we can solve for $c$ to get $c = 15$.\nThen the denominator is $2x^2+7x-15$ which can be factored as $(2x-3)(x+5)$. Hence, the vertical asymptote is given by $\\boxed{x = \\frac{3}{2}}$."
