        "inference": "The derivative of the second parabola is $y' = 4x^3 + 3ax^2 + 2x + b$.  Since the two parabolas are tangent at two points, their slopes are equal at those points.  Therefore we have the system of equations:\n$$4x^3 + 3ax^2 + 2x + b = 2x,$$\n$$12x^2 + 6ax + 2 = 2.$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $4x^3 + 3ax^2 - 12x^2 + 2x + b = 0$, which simplifies to $4x^3 + (3a - 12)x^2 + 2x + b = 0$.  Since this equation has two real roots (the $x$-coordinates of the points of tangency), the discriminant must be zero:\n$$(3a - 12)^2 - 4(4)(2x + b) = 0.$$\nSimplifying gives $9a^2 - 72a + 144 - 32x - 16b = 0$, or $9a^2 - 72a - 16b + 112 - 32x = 0$.\n\nSince we are told that the points of tangency have positive $x$-coordinates, $-32x < 0$, so $32x > 0$, or $x > 0$.

But this is just the discriminant of the equation $4x^3 + (3a - 12)x^2 + 2x + b = 0$, so we have\n$$9a^2 - 72a - 16b + 112 - 32x = (3a - 8)^2 = 0,$$\nwhich gives $3a - 8 = 0$, or $a = \\frac{8}{3}$.  Substituting this into the discriminant equation gives\n$$9\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^2 - 72\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right) - 16b + 112 - 32x = 0,$$\nwhich simplifies to $64 - 288 - 16b + 112 - 32x = 0$, or $-16b - 32x = -88$.  Solving for $b$ gives $b = \\frac{11}{2} - 2x$.  Since $b$ is a constant, $2x$ must also be a constant.  Thus $x$ is a constant, and so the difference between the $x$-coordinates of the points of tangency is zero.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{0}. I hope it is correct.",
