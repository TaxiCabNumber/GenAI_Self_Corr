At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

The prime factorization of $2005$ is $2005=5\\cdot13\\cdot31$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solutions are \\begin{align*}\n(a,b,c,d)&=(1,0,0,0),\\\\\n(a,b,c,d)&=(0,2,0,0),\\\\\n(a,b,c,d)&=(0,0,4,0),\\\\\n(a,b,c,d)&=(0,0,0,6).\n\\end{align*}\n\nHence, the number of distinct four-tuples is $4$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{4}.$ I hope it is correct.",
