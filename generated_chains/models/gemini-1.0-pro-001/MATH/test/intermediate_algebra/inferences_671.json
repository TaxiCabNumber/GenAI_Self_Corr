At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe graph of the rational function $\\frac{2x^7-5x^4 + 3x^3 -x+5}{q(x)} $ has a horizontal asymptote. What is the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$?",
        "inference": "**SOLUTION:** \nWe know that a rational function $f(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y = a$ if and only if the degree of the numerator $p(x)$ is less than the degree of the denominator $q(x)$. So, in this case, we have $p(x) = 2x^7-5x^4 + 3x^3 -x+5$, and we want to find the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will give us a horizontal asymptote.\n\nThe degree of $p(x)$ is $7$, so the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ is $8$.\n**Final Answer: \\boxed{8}. I hope it is correct.**",
        "ground_truth": "The numerator of the given function has degree $7$. Hence, if $q(x)$ has degree less than $7$, the function will have no horizontal asymptote. Therefore, the degree of $q(x)$ must be at least $7$. To see that $7$ works, we can consider $q(x) = x^7$. Then as $x$ grows away from $0$, the $x^7$ terms in the function will dominate and the function will tend towards $\\frac{2x^7}{x^7} = 2$. Thus the smallest possible degree of $q(x)$ is $\\boxed{7}$."
