        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nSasha and Chloe are throwing darts at a map of the complex plane. Sasha's dart lands on the point $15+8i$. Chloe's dart lands on the point $3-4i$. How much closer to the origin is Chloe's dart compared to Sasha's?",
        "inference": "**Step 1**: Find the distance $d_1$ from Sasha's dart to the origin using the distance formula:\n\n$d_1 = \\sqrt{(15-0)^2+(8-0)^2} = \\sqrt{225+64} = \\sqrt{289} = 17$\n\n**Step 2**: Find the distance $d_2$ from Chloe's dart to the origin using the same formula:\n\n$d_2 = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2+(-4-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\n\n**Step 3**: Subtract $d_2$ from $d_1$ to find how much closer Chloe's dart is:\n\n$d_1 - d_2 = 17 - 5 = 12$\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{12}$. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "The distance from one point to the origin is equivalent to the magnitude. The distance from Sasha's dart is $|15+8i| = \\sqrt{15^2 + 8^2} = 17$. The distance from Chloe's dart is $|3-4i| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$. We need to calculate the difference in the distances. Chloe's dart is closer by a distance of $17 - 5 = \\boxed{12}$."
