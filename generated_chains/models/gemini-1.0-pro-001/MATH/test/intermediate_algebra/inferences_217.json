At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe sequence 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 22, 23, 46, 47, $\\dots$ is formed as follows:\n\n$\\bullet$ Start with the number 1.\n\n$\\bullet$ Add one to get 2.\n\n$\\bullet$ Double that to get 4.\n\n$\\bullet$ Add one to get 5.\n\n$\\bullet$ Double that to get 10, and so on.\n\nWe repeat the steps of \"add one\" and \"double that\", alternating between them.\n\nThe 100th term will be of the form $3 \\cdot 2^k - 1.$  Compute $k.$",
        "inference": "Since the alternating pattern repeats every 2 terms, we have 100 terms in 50 repetitions of the pattern. Thus, the 100th term is the 50th term of the pattern, which is the term when $k=49$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{49}.$  I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "If we take every other term, starting with the second term 2, we get\n\\[2, 5, 11, 23, 47, \\dots.\\]If we add one to each of these terms, we get\n\\[3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \\dots.\\]Each term appear to be double the previous term.\n\nTo confirm this, let one term in the original sequence be $x - 1,$ after we have added 1.  Then the next term is $2(x - 1) = 2x - 2,$ and the next term after that is $2x - 2 + 1 = 2x - 1.$\n\nThis confirms that in the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, $\\dots,$ each term is double the previous term.  Then the 50th term in this geometric sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49},$ so the 100th term in the original sequence is $3 \\cdot 2^{49} - 1,$ so $k = \\boxed{49}.$"
