What is the least possible degree of $p$?",

Thus, $p(x) - 1$ has degree 1.\n\n- The polynomial function $p(x)$ crosses the horizontal line $y = 3$ at exactly three points, so $p(x) - 3$ has three distinct roots. Thus, $p(x) - 3$ has degree 3.\n\n- The polynomial function $p(x)$ crosses the horizontal line $y = 5$ at exactly five points, so $p(x) - 5$ has five distinct roots. Thus, $p(x) - 5$ has degree 5.\n\n- Since $p(x) - 1$, $p(x) - 3$, and $p(x) - 5$ are all factors of $p(x)$, the least possible degree of $p(x)$ is the sum of their degrees, which is $1 + 3 + 5 = \\boxed{9}$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{9}$.
