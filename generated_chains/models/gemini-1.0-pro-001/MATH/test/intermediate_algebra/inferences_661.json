At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA sequence of positive integers is constructed by listing the first 4, then skipping one, listing the next 5, skipping 2, listing 6, skipping 3, and, on the $n$th iteration, listing $n + 3$ and skipping $n$. The sequence begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13. What is the 500,000th number in the sequence?",
        "inference": "On the $n$th iteration, $n + 3$ numbers are listed.  On the first iteration, the 4 numbers are listed.  After that, there will be a skip of $n$ numbers, and then $n + 3$ numbers will be listed.  So, for the $n$th iteration, the $n$th number in that iteration will be the $4 + (n-1)\\times(n+3)+n$.  Therefore, the 500,000th number in the sequence is \n\n$$4 + (499,999-1)\\times(499,999+3)+499,999=4+499,998\\times500,002+499,999=\\boxed{249,999,503}.$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{249,999,503}.$ I hope it is correct.",

The last skipped integer is $996^2 + 4 \\cdot 996 = 996000.$\n\nAt the start of the 997th iteration, we write down another 1000 integers, so the 500000th term is $\\boxed{996506}.$"
