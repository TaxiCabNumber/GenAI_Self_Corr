At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo geometric sequences $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\ldots$ have the same common ratio, with $a_1 = 27$, $b_1=99$, and $a_{15}=b_{11}$. Find $a_9.$",
