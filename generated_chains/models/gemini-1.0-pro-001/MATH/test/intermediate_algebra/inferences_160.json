        "inference": "1) The graph of a rational function has a hole at a point $(a,b)$ if and only if $a$ is a zero of the denominator, but $a$ is not a zero of the numerator. In other words, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ has a hole at $(a,b)$ if and only if $q(a)=0$ and $p(a)\\neq0$.\n\nIn this case, the denominator is $x^2+4x+3=(x+1)(x+3)$, so the zeros of the denominator are $x=-1$ and $x=-3$. The numerator is $x^2+3x$, so the zeros of the numerator are $x=0$ and $x=-3$. Therefore, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$ has a hole at $(0,0)$. Thus, $a=1$.\n\n2) The graph of a rational function has a vertical asymptote at a point $(a,b)$ if and only if $a$ is a zero of the denominator, but $a$ is not a zero of the numerator. In other words, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ has a vertical asymptote at $(a,b)$ if and only if $q(a)=0$ and $p(a)\\neq0$.\n\nIn this case, the denominator is $x^2+4x+3=(x+1)(x+3)$, so the zeros of the denominator are $x=-1$ and $x=-3$. The numerator is $x^2+3x$, so the zeros of the numerator are $x=0$ and $x=-3$. Therefore, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=-1$ and $x=-3$. Thus, $b=2$.\n\n3) The graph of a rational function has a horizontal asymptote at a point $(a,b)$ if and only if $a$ is the limit of the function as $x$ approaches infinity. In other words, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $(a,b)$ if and only if $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)=a$.\n\nTo find the horizontal asymptote, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the highest power of $x$ in the denominator. In this case, the highest power of $x$ in the denominator is $x^2$, so we divide both the numerator and denominator by $x^2$. This gives us:\n\n$$f(x)=\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}=\\frac{1+\\frac{3}{x}}{1+\\frac{4}{x}+\\frac{3}{x^2}}$$\n\nAs $x$ approaches infinity, the terms $\\frac{3}{x}$ and $\\frac{3}{x^2}$ approach zero. Therefore, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$ has a horizontal asymptote at $y=1$. Thus, $c=1$.\n\n4) An oblique asymptote is a line that the graph of a rational function approaches as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity. To find the oblique asymptote, we can use long division to divide the numerator by the denominator. The remainder of the division will be a linear function. The graph of the rational function will approach this linear function as $x$ approaches infinity or negative infinity.\n\nIn this case, we divide $x^2+3x$ by $x^2+4x+3$ using long division:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c} \\quad\\quad\\quad x-1 \\\\\\ x^2+4x+3\\overline{)x^2+3x} \\\\\\ \\underline{-(x^2+4x+3)} \\\\\\ \\quad\\quad -x \\end{array}$$\n\nTherefore, the graph of $f(x)=\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3}$ has an oblique asymptote at $y=x-1$. Thus, $d=1$.\n\\(\\boxed{a+2b+3c+4d=1+2(2)+3(1)+4(1)=\\boxed{10}.} I hope it is correct.\\)",
        "ground_truth": "We can factor the numerator and denominator to get $$\\frac{x^2+3x}{x^2+4x+3} = \\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)}.$$In this representation we can immediately read that there is a hole at $x=-3$, and a vertical asymptote at $x=-1$. There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes, so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors we have\n$$\\frac{x(x+3)}{(x+3)(x+1)} = \\frac{x}{x+1}.$$We can write $\\frac{x}{x+1}$ as $1 - \\frac{1}{x+1}$ which shows that as $x$ becomes very large, the graph tends towards $1$, giving us a horizontal asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one horizontal asymptote, or a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote, we have that $c=1$ and $d=0$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+3+0 = \\boxed{6}.$"
