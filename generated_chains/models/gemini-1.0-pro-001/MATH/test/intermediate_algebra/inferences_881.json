However, the ratio of the derivatives is not zero, so there is no removable discontinuity. Therefore, \\(a=0\\).\n\n**Vertical Asymptotes:**\nThe denominator is zero at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\). Therefore, \\(b=2\\).\n\n**Horizontal Asymptotes:**\nAs \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the numerator and denominator both become very large and positive, so the ratio approaches 0.

There are no more holes or vertical asymptotes so $a=1$ and $b=1$. If we cancel out the common factors, our rational function simplifies to\n$$\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}.$$We see that as $x$ becomes very large, the $x^2$ term in the numerator will dominate. To be more precise, we can use polynomial division to write $\\frac{x^2-x+1}{3(2x-3)}$ as $$\\frac{2x+1}{12}+\\frac{7}{12(2x-3)},$$from which we can see that for large $x,$ the graph tends towards $\\frac{2x+1}{12},$ giving us an oblique asymptote.\n\nSince the graph cannot have more than one oblique asymptote, or an oblique asymptote and a horizontal asymptote, we have that $c=0$ and $d=1$. Therefore, $a+2b+3c+4d = 1+2+0+4 = \\boxed{7}.$"
