At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

        "inference": "Solution:\nSince the polynomials have a root in common, they have a common factor.  This common factor must be of the form $(x - r)$ for some number $r$.  Thus, we have\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 7x + b &= (x - r)(x - s) \\\\\nx^2 + 2x - 2b &= (x - r)(x - t)\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nfor some numbers $s$ and $t$.  Expanding the left-hand sides of these equations and equating the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$, we get the following system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n-s - t &= -7 \\\\\nst &= b \\\\\n-s - t &= 2 \\\\\nst &= -2b\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the third equation, we get $2(s - t) = -9$, so $s - t = -\\frac{9}{2}$.  Substituting this into the first equation, we get $s + t = -7 + \\frac{9}{2} = -\\frac{5}{2}$.  Thus, $s = -\\frac{7}{4}$ and $t = \\frac{1}{4}$.  Substituting these values into the equation $st = b$, we get $b = \\left(-\\frac{7}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\boxed{-\\frac{7}{16}}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-\\frac{7}{16}}$.
