At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nIn a certain polynomial, all the coefficients are integers, and the constant coefficient is 42.  All the roots are integers, and distinct.  Find the largest possible number of integer roots.",
        "inference": "The constant coefficient of any polynomial is equal to the product of all its roots.\nSince the constant coefficient is 42, the possible integer roots can be the divisors of 42.  They are \\{-42, -35, -21, -14, -7, -6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 35, 42\\}. Since the roots are distinct, the maximum number of integer roots is 4.\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{4}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "By the Integer Root Theorem, any integer root must be a factor of 42.  The prime factorization of 42 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7.$  Furthermore, the product of the roots is $(-1)^n \\cdot \\frac{42}{a_0},$ where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial, and $a_0$ is the leading coefficient.\n\nTo maximize the number of integer roots, which must be distinct, we can take the integer roots to be 2, 3, 7, 1, and $-1.$  This gives us a maximum of $\\boxed{5}$ integer roots."
