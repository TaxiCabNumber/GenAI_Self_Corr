        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Mendez awards extra credit on quizzes to his students with quiz grades that exceed the class mean. Given that 107 students take the same quiz, what is the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit?",
        "inference": "The largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is half the class plus one.\n\nSince 107 is not even, the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is $107/2 + 1 = 54$.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{$54$}. I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "It is not possible for all 107 to exceed the mean since the mean is always greater than or equal to the smallest element.  However 106 of the students can exceed the mean.  For example, if 106 students get a 5 and the other student gets a 4, the mean is slightly less than 5 and all $\\boxed{106}$ of the students that scored 5 will exceed the mean."
