Thus $w+3i$ and $w-3i$ are roots, and $w+9i$ and $w-9i$ are roots.\nThus, $w+3i = w-3i$, which implies $6i=0$, a contradiction.\nThe only possible case for the roots to be real is if the complex parts cancel out.\n\nThe sum of the roots is $r_1+r_2+r_3 = (w+3i) + (w+9i) + (2w-4) = 4w + 12i - 4$.\nThe sum of the roots taken two at a time is\n$r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = (w+3i)(w+9i) + (w+3i)(2w-4) + (w+9i)(2w-4) = 5w^2 - 8w - 27 + (30w-48)i$.\nSince the coefficients are real, the imaginary part of this must be zero, so $30w-48=0$. This gives $w = \\frac{48}{30} = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6$.\nThen $4w-4 = 4(1.6)-4 = 6.4-4 = 2.4$.\nAlso, $5w^2 - 8w - 27 = 5(1.6)^2 - 8(1.6) - 27 = 5(2.56) - 12.8 - 27 = 12.8 - 12.8 - 27 = -27$.\nTherefore, the quadratic part is $x^2 - (4w-4)x - 27 = 0$.\nIf the question is about the cubic equation, then the sum of the roots must be $r_1+r_2+r_3 = 4w-4$.\nThe sum of roots taken two at a time is $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 5w^2-8w-27$.\nSince the coefficients are real, the imaginary parts must cancel out, thus $30w-48=0$, and $w = 1.6$. Then the cubic is $x^3 - (4w-4)x^2 + (5w^2-8w-27)x + r_1r_2r_3 = 0$.\nIf $w=1.6$, $4w-4 = 2.4$, and $5w^2 - 8w - 27 = -27$.\nSo the coefficients are $a= -2.4$, $b = -27$, and $c = r_1r_2r_3$.\nThus the cubic is $x^3 - 2.4x^2 - 27x + c = 0$.  Comparing coefficients to the general form, $a=-(4w-4)=-2.4$. The cubic is $x^3 - (4w-4)x^2 + (5w^2-8w-27)x + c=0$.\nThe constant term is $c = r_1 r_2 r_3$.\nIf $w=8/5$, then the cubic is $x^3 - 2.4x^2 - 27x + c = 0$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-27}$",
