        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAmerigo Vespucci has a map of America drawn on the complex plane. The map does not distort distances. Los Angeles corresponds to $0$ on this complex plane, and Boston corresponds to $2600i$. Meanwhile, Knoxville corresponds to the point $780+1040i$. With these city-point correspondences, how far is it from Knoxville to Los Angeles on this complex plane?",
        "inference": "The distance between two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$ is given by $|z_1 - z_2|$. In this case, Los Angeles is represented by $0$, and Knoxville is represented by $780 + 1040i$.  The distance between Knoxville and Los Angeles is $|780 + 1040i - 0| = |780 + 1040i|$.  The magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.  Thus, the distance is $\\sqrt{780^2 + 1040^2} = \\sqrt{608400 + 1081600} = \\sqrt{1690000} = 1300$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1300}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Note that $780=\\frac 3{10}\\cdot 2600$, and $1040=\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot 2600$. Thus, geometrically, the distance from Los Angeles to Knoxville forms a 3-4-5 right triangle, with hypotenuse of length $\\frac{5}{10}\\cdot 2600=\\boxed{1300}$. Since magnitude of a number is defined to be the distance from the origin of that number, $1300$ is our answer."
