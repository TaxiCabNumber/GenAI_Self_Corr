        "inference": "Let the legs of the right triangle be x and x+1.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $x^2 + (x+1)^2 = 29^2$.\n$x^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$\n$2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$\n$2x^2 + 2x - 840 = 0$\n$x^2 + x - 420 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we need two numbers that multiply to -420 and add to 1.\nThe numbers are 21 and -20.\n$(x+21)(x-20) = 0$\n$x = -21$ or $x = 20$\nSince the lengths of the sides of a triangle must be positive, we take $x = 20$.\nThe lengths of the legs are 20 and 21.\nThe sum of the lengths of the two legs is $20 + 21 = 41$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{41}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let's call the length of the shorter leg $x$. Then the length of the longer leg is $x + 1$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we write the equation $x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 29^2$ and solve for $x$. Expanding $(x + 1)^2$, we get $x\n^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$. This can be simplified to $2x^2 + 2x = 840$, or $x^2 + x = 420$. Factoring out $x$ on the left, we can rewrite it as $x(x + 1) = 420$. In other words, the product of these two consecutive numbers is 420, which means they must each be close to the square root of 420. Indeed, $20 \\times 21 = 420$, so the legs must be 20 and 21. Their sum is $20 + 21 = \\boxed{41}$."
