At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?",
        "inference": "1. The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.\n2. If each exterior angle of a regular polygon is 30 degrees, then the number of sides of the polygon is 360/30 = 12.\n3. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.\n4. In this case, n = 12, so the sum of the interior angles is (12-2) * 180 = 10 * 180 = 1800 degrees.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{1800}$ degrees. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees."
