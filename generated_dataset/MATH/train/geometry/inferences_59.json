        "inference": "The given points are $A(2,3)$, $A'(2,-5)$, $B(7,8)$, $B'(7,-10)$, $C(-4,6)$, $C'(-4,-8)$.\nThe midpoints of $AA'$, $BB'$, and $CC'$ are $(2, -1)$, $(7, -1)$, and $(-4, -1)$, respectively. These midpoints lie on the horizontal line $y=-1$.\nThe line of reflection must be perpendicular to the line connecting the midpoints, which is $y=-1$.  A line perpendicular to a horizontal line is a vertical line.\nSince the midpoints are $(2, -1)$, $(7, -1)$, and $(-4, -1)$, the vertical lines $x=2$, $x=7$, and $x=-4$ pass through the midpoints.\nThe three midpoints lie on the horizontal line $y = -1$. The line of reflection must be perpendicular to this line, meaning it must be a vertical line. The $x$-coordinates of the midpoints are $2, 7, -4$. The line of reflection must bisect the segments $AA'$, $BB'$, and $CC'$, and the x-coordinates of the midpoints must be equidistant from the vertical line of reflection. The vertical line that is equidistant to all the three $x$ coordinates is the vertical line $x = \\frac{2+7-4}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$, which is not correct.\nThe reflection is a vertical line that passes through the midpoint of the x coordinates.  The line of reflection must be equidistant from the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $A'$, $B$ and $B'$, and $C$ and $C'$.\nThe line of reflection must be the vertical line $x = \\frac{2+2}{2} = 2$ or $x=\\frac{7+7}{2} = 7$ or $x=\\frac{-4-4}{2} = -4$.\nThe vertical line that is equidistant from $2$ and $2$ is $x=2$.
