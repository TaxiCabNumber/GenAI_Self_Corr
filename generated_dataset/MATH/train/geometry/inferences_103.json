At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo concentric circles are centered at point P. The sides of a 45 degree angle at P form an arc on the smaller circle that is the same length as an arc on the larger circle formed by the sides of a 36  degree angle at P. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
