At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTwo vertices of an obtuse triangle are $(6,4)$ and $(0,0)$. The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?",
        "inference": "Let the two vertices be $A(6,4)$ and $B(0,0)$. Let the third vertex be $C(x,0)$, where $x<0$.\nThe area of the triangle formed by the points $A(x_1, y_1)$, $B(x_2, y_2)$, and $C(x_3, y_3)$ is given by the absolute value of\n$$\\frac{1}{2} |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|$$\nIn this case, $A(6,4)$, $B(0,0)$, and $C(x,0)$.

        "ground_truth": "We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$."
