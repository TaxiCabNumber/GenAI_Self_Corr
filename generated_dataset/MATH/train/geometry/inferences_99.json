        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?",
        "inference": "1. **Find the height of each triangular face:**  The lateral edges form the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the height of the triangular face as one leg and half the base edge as the other leg. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   height\u00b2 + (6/2)\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n   height\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n   height\u00b2 + 9 = 25\n   height\u00b2 = 16\n   height = 4\n\n2. **Calculate the area of one triangular face:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12 square units.\n\n3. **Find the total area of the four triangular faces:**  Total area = 4 * area of one face = 4 * 12 = 48 square units.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$."
