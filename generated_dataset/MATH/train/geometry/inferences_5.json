        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nPoints $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?",
        "inference": "1. The coordinates of point A are (-4, 1).\n2. Rotating a point (x, y) 90 degrees clockwise about the origin results in the point (y, -x).\n3. Applying this rule to point A(-4, 1), we get (1, -(-4)) which is (1, 4).\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(1,4)}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need."
