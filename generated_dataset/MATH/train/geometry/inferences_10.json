I hope it is correct.'\nA right pyramid has a square base with perimeter 24 inches. Its apex is 9 inches from each of the other vertices. What is the height of the pyramid from its peak to the center of its square base, in inches?",
        "inference": "The perimeter of the square base is 24 inches.\nSince the perimeter is 4 * side, we have 4 * side = 24, so the side length of the square base is 6 inches.\nThe center of the square base is equidistant from each vertex. The distance from the center to each vertex is the same as the distance from the apex to each vertex, which is given as 9 inches.\nConsider a right triangle formed by connecting the apex to a vertex of the base, the center of the base, and the midpoint of a side of the base.\nThe hypotenuse of this right triangle is the distance from the apex to the vertex, which is 9 inches.\nThe distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of a side is half the side length, which is 6/2 = 3 inches.\nLet h be the height of the pyramid from the peak to the center of the square base.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, we have h^2 + 3^2 = 9^2.\nh^2 + 9 = 81\nh^2 = 72\nh = \u221a72 = \u221a(36 * 2) = 6\u221a2\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$ inches.
