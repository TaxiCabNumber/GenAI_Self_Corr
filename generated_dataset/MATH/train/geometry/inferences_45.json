At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe first square below is in position ABCD. After rotating the square 90 degrees clockwise about its center point, the second square is in position DABC, as shown. Next, square DABC is reflected over its vertical line of symmetry, resulting in the third square in position CBAD. If the pattern of alternately rotating 90 degrees clockwise and reflecting over the vertical line of symmetry continues, in what position will the 2007th square be? Write your answer starting with the lower left vertex and continuing clockwise with the other three vertices. Do not use spaces or commas when entering your answer.\n\n[asy]\nsize(250);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,10),NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(10,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(10,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(20,10),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(30,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(30,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(20,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(50,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(50,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(40,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(40,10),NW);\nlabel(\"$1$st square\",(5,13),N);\nlabel(\"$2$nd square\",(25,13),N);\nlabel(\"$3$rd square\",(45,13),N);\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(10,10)--(0,10)--cycle);\ndraw((20,0)--(30,0)--(30,10)--(20,10)--cycle);\ndraw((40,0)--(50,0)--(50,10)--(40,10)--cycle);\n[/asy]",
