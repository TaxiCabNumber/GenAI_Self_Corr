        "inference": "The problem states that the centers of the circles are arranged in a 10x10 grid pattern, meaning there are 10 circles across and 10 circles down.  The side length of the square is determined by the distance between the leftmost and rightmost circles (10 circles * 10 inches/circle = 100 inches), and between the topmost and bottommost circles (also 100 inches).  Thus, the side length of the square is 100 inches.  The area of the square is 100 * 100 = 10000 square inches.\n\n$\\boxed{10000}$\n",
