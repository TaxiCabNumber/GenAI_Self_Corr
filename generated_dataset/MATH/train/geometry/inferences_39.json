        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?",
        "inference": "1. The area of a lateral face of a pyramid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * slant height.\n\n2. We are given the area of one lateral face (75 square meters) and the slant height (30 meters).\n\n3. Plugging the given values into the formula, we get: 75 = (1/2) * base * 30\n\n4. Simplifying the equation: 75 = 15 * base\n\n5. Solving for the base: base = 75 / 15 = 5 meters\n\n6. The base of the lateral face is the side of the equilateral triangular base of the pyramid.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters."
