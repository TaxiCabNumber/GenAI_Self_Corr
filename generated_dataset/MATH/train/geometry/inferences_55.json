At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?",
        "inference": "1. The surface area of a cube is given by the formula 6s\u00b2, where s is the length of a side.\n2. We are given that the surface area is 216 square centimeters, so we have 6s\u00b2 = 216.\n3. Dividing both sides by 6, we get s\u00b2 = 36.\n4. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that s = 6 cm.\n5. The volume of a cube is given by the formula s\u00b3, where s is the side length.\n6. Since s = 6 cm, the volume is 6\u00b3 = 216 cubic centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{216}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube."
