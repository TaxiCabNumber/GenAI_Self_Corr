        "inference": "The area of parallelogram $CDEF$ is $36$. Since $G$ and $H$ are the midpoints of $CD$ and $EF$, the line segment $GH$ is parallel to $CF$ and $DE$.

The trapezoids have the same area, so the area of each trapezoid is half of the parallelogram's area, which is $36/2 = 18$.  The segment $GH$ also creates two triangles with a shared base $CF$.  The triangles $CDG$ and $GEH$ have the same area since they have the same height and the same base length. $CDG$ and $GEH$ are both half the area of a parallelogram with base CD and height the same as the height of parallelogram CDEF.

        "inference": "Let $h$ be the height of parallelogram $CDEF$ corresponding to base $CF$. The area of parallelogram $CDEF$ is given as $36$. Since $G$ and $H$ are the midpoints of $CD$ and $EF$, $GH$ is parallel to $CF$ and $DE$. Also, $GH$ divides the parallelogram into two trapezoids.\nSince $GH$ is parallel to $CF$ and $DE$, the height of the trapezoids is the same as the height of the parallelogram, $h$. The two trapezoids have the same area, so the area of each trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 = 18$.\nAlso, triangles $CDG$ and $GEH$ are congruent since they have the same base $CG = GE$ and same height $h$.
