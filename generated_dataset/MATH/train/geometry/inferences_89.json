At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nAn octagon is inscribed in a square so that the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. The perimeter of the square is 108 centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon?",
        "inference": "Let the side length of the square be $s$.\nThe perimeter of the square is $4s = 108$ cm, so $s = \\frac{108}{4} = 27$ cm.\nThe vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. This means each side of the square is divided into three equal segments.\nThe vertices of the octagon form smaller squares on the corners of the larger square. The side length of these smaller squares is $\\frac{s}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9$ cm.\nThe area of each of these smaller squares is $9^2 = 81$ square centimeters.\nThere are four such smaller squares.\nThe area of the four smaller squares is $4 \\times 81 = 324$ square centimeters.\nThe area of the square is $27^2 = 729$ square centimeters.\nThe area of the octagon is the area of the square minus the area of the four smaller squares.\nArea of the octagon = $729 - 324 = 405$ square centimeters.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{405}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Each side of the square has length $27$. Each trisected segment therefore has length $9$. We can form the octagon by taking away four triangles, each of which has area $\\frac{(9)(9)}{2}$, for a total of $(2)(9)(9) = 162$. The total area of the square is $27^2=729$, so the area of the octagon is $729-162=\\boxed{567}$."
