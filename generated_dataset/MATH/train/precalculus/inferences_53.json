I hope it is correct.'\nA torus (donut) having inner radius $2$ and outer radius $4$ sits on a flat table.  What is the radius of the largest spherical ball that can be placed on top of the center torus so that the ball still touches the horizontal plane?  (If the $xy$-plane is the table, the torus is formed by revolving the circle in the $xz$-plane centered at $(3,0,1)$ with radius $1$ about the $z$-axis. The spherical ball has its center on the $z$-axis and rests on either the table or the donut.)",
        "inference": "The torus is formed by revolving the circle in the $xz$-plane centered at $(3,0,1)$ with radius $1$ about the $z$-axis.  The equation of the circle in the $xz$-plane is $(x-3)^2 + z^2 = 1^2 = 1$. The torus is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ such that\n\\[ ((x-3)^2 + y^2)^{1/2} = 1\\]\nfor some $y$. The distance from the center of the torus to the table is 1. The torus has inner radius 2 and outer radius 4. The center of the circle in the $xz$-plane has coordinates $(3,0,1)$, so the center of the torus is at $(3,0,1)$.\nThe inner radius of the torus is 2, so the minimum $z$-value is $1-2 = -1$.\nThe outer radius of the torus is 4, so the maximum $z$-value is $1+4 = 5$. The sphere that touches the torus and the table is centered on the z-axis.\nThe center of the sphere is on the $z$-axis, so its coordinates are $(0,0,z_0)$.\nThe radius of the sphere is $z_0$. The sphere touches the torus and the table, so its center must lie on the line $z=z_0$.  Since the sphere touches the table, we have $z_0 = r$. The sphere's center is $(0,0,z_0)$.\nThe distance from the center of the sphere to the torus is the radius of the sphere, $z_0$. The largest spherical ball that can be placed on top of the torus and touches the horizontal plane will have its center at height 5.  The largest sphere that can touch the horizontal plane will have its center at $z=5$.\nThe distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere is $r$.\nThe distance from the $z$-axis to the torus is $3$, and the radius of the torus is 3, so the largest sphere will touch the torus at the outer radius.\nThe distance from the center of the torus $(3,0,1)$ to the center of the sphere $(0,0,z_0)$ is $z_0-1$.\nThe inner radius of the torus is 2, so the distance from the center of the torus to the inner circle is 1. The radius of the sphere must be at most 5.\nFor the sphere to touch the torus, the distance between the center of the sphere and the center of the torus must be 5.\nThe equation of the torus is\n\\[(x^2+y^2+(z-1)^2-1^2)^2-(y^2+(z-1)^2-1)^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2-2z)^2-(y^2+(z-1)^2-1)^2 = 0\\]\nThe height of the center of the sphere is $r$. The outer radius of the torus is 4, and the center of the torus is at height 1, so the maximum height of the sphere is $1+4 = 5$.\nThe largest possible $z$-value for the center of the sphere is $1+4 = 5$, so $r=5$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$",
