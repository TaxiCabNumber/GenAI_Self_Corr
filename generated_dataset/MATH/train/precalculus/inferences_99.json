As $y$ increases from $2n\\pi$ to $(2n + 1)\\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $0$ to $\\pi$.  As $y$ increases from $(2n+ 1)\\pi$ to just under $(2n+ 2)\\pi$, the angle of $e^{iy}$ strictly increases from $\\pi$ to just under $2\\pi$.\n\nComparing the angle information for  $\\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ above, we see that $\\frac{iy - 1}{iy + 1}$ and $e^{iy}$ are equal for exactly one $y$ in $(2n\\pi,(2n + 1)\\pi)$, and for no $y$ in $[(2n + 1)\\pi,(2n + 2)\\pi]$.

We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go further because $9\\pi < 30 < 10\\pi$.\n\nBecause we have $5$ positive roots for $y$, by symmetry we have $5$ negative roots for $y$.
