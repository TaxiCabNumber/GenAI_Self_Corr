        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nCaptain Zarnin of Planet Hvan has four job openings for his battle station: Assistant Engineer, Weapons Maintenance, Field Technician, and Radio Specialist. Zarnin has received 24 resumes and found himself less than thrilled about half of them and does not hire them. The rest, he thinks, could fill any of the open posts. In how many ways can Zarnin staff his battle station?\n\nNote: A candidate can fill at most one job opening.",
        "inference": "1. Zarnin received 24 resumes.\n2. He was less thrilled about half of them, so he didn't hire them. This means he has 24 / 2 = 12 resumes that he is considering.\n3. There are 4 job openings: Assistant Engineer, Weapons Maintenance, Field Technician, and Radio Specialist.\n4. For the first job opening, Zarnin can choose any of the 12 candidates.\n5. For the second job opening, Zarnin can choose any of the remaining 11 candidates.\n6. For the third job opening, Zarnin can choose any of the remaining 10 candidates.\n7. For the fourth job opening, Zarnin can choose any of the remaining 9 candidates.\n8. The total number of ways to staff the battle station is the product of the number of choices for each position: 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 = 11,880.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{11880}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Of the 24 people who applied, only 12 people are suitable to be hired. Therefore, there are 12 suited to be Assistant Engineer. After that position is filled, there are only 11 left for Weapons Maintenance, then 10 left for Field Technician, and then 9 for Radio Specialist. Therefore, there are $12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{11,\\!880}$ possible ways in which Zarnin can fill his job openings."
