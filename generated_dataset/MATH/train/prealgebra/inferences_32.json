At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe table shown is partially filled in with the results of a survey done by the radio station KMAT. How many of the females surveyed listen to this station?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{| l | c | r |}\n\\hline\n& listen & don't listen \\\\\n\\hline\nmales & 62 & \\\\ \\hline\nfemales & & 102 \\\\ \\hline\ntotal & 130 & 150 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}",

Males who don't listen = Total males - Males who listen = (280 - 130) - 62 = 150 - 62 = 88\n6. Females who don't listen = 102\n7. Females who listen = Total females - Females who don't listen = 280 - 150 - 102 = 28\n8. Total who listen = 130 = Males who listen + Females who listen = 62 + Females who listen \n9.

        "ground_truth": "Since there were a total of $130$ people surveyed who listen to this station and we know that $62$ of them are male, $130-62=\\boxed{68}$ of the females surveyed said that they listen to this station."

        "inference": "1. Total who listen = 130\n2. Total who don't listen = 150\n3. Total surveyed = Total who listen + Total who don't listen = 130 + 150 = 280\n4. Males who listen = 62\n5. Females who listen = Total who listen - Males who listen = 130 - 62 = 68\n6. Females who don't listen = Total who don't listen - Males who don't listen\n\n\nThe crucial issue in the previous solution was incorrect calculation of the number of males who don't listen. Since the total surveyed is 280, we don't need to calculate that.  We directly subtract males who listen from total males.\nWe have the total males who don't listen.\n\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. Total who listen = 130\n2. Total who don't listen = 150\n3. Total surveyed = 280\n4. Males who listen = 62\n5. Males who don't listen = Total males - Males who listen = 280 - 130 -62 = 150-62 = 88\n6. Females who don't listen = 102\n7. Males who don't listen + Females who don't listen = Total don't listen\n8. Females who listen = Total who listen - Males who listen = 130 - 62 = 68\n\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{68}$",
