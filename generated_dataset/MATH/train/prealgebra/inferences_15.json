Calculate the mean: The mean is $\\frac{12+14+38+45+x}{5} = \\frac{109+x}{5}$.\n4. Set up the equation for the median being 5 less than the mean:\n   If the median is 14, then $14 = \\frac{109+x}{5} - 5$.\n   Solving for $x$, we have $14 = \\frac{109+x}{5} - 5 \\Rightarrow 14 + 5 = \\frac{109+x}{5} \\Rightarrow 19 \\times 5 = 109 + x \\Rightarrow 95 = 109 + x \\Rightarrow x = -14$.\n   If the median is $x$, then $x = \\frac{109+x}{5} - 5$.\n   Solving for $x$, we have $5x = 109+x - 25 \\Rightarrow 4x = 84 \\Rightarrow x = 21$.\n   If the median is 38, then $38 = \\frac{109+x}{5} - 5$.\n   Solving for $x$, we have $38 = \\frac{109+x}{5} - 5 \\Rightarrow 38+5 = \\frac{109+x}{5} \\Rightarrow 43 \\times 5 = 109+x \\Rightarrow 215 = 109+x \\Rightarrow x = 106$.\n5.

Determine the correct value of $x$.\n   Since $x$ must be a negative integer and $x \\le 14$, the median is 14.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{-14}$",
        "ground_truth": "Since $x$ is negative, the median of the set is 14.  Therefore, the mean of the set is $14+5=19$, and its sum is $19\\cdot 5=95$.  Since 12, 38, 45, and 14 sum to 109, the remaining integer $x$ must be $95-109=\\boxed{-14}$."
