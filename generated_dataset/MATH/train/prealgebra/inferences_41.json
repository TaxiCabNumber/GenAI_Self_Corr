At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThere is a committee composed of eight women and two men. When they meet, they sit in a row---the women in indistinguishable rocking chairs and the men on indistinguishable stools.  How many distinct ways are there for me to arrange the eight chairs and two stools for a meeting?",
        "inference": "We have 8 women and 2 men.\nThe women sit in indistinguishable rocking chairs.\nThe men sit on indistinguishable stools.\nThe total number of people is 8 + 2 = 10.\nWe need to arrange 8 rocking chairs and 2 stools in a row.\nThis is equivalent to arranging 8 indistinguishable rocking chairs and 2 indistinguishable stools in a row.\nThe number of ways to arrange n objects, where there are n1 identical objects of type 1, n2 identical objects of type 2, ..., nk identical objects of type k, is given by\n$$\\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\cdots n_k!}$$\nwhere $n = n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_k$.\nIn this case, we have $n = 8 + 2 = 10$ total positions. We have 8 indistinguishable rocking chairs and 2 indistinguishable stools.\nSo we have $n = 10$, $n_1 = 8$, $n_2 = 2$.\nThe number of ways to arrange them is\n$$\\frac{10!}{8! 2!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}{8! \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 5 \\times 9 = 45$$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Because the rocking chairs are indistinguishable from each other and the stools are indistinguishable from each other, we can think of first placing the two stools somewhere in the ten slots and then filling the rest with rocking chairs. The first stool has $10$ slots in which it can go, and the second has $9$. However, because they are indistinguishable from each other, we have overcounted the number of ways to place the stools by a factor of $2$, so we divide by $2$. Thus, there are $\\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = \\boxed{45}$ distinct ways to arrange the ten chairs and stools for a meeting."

        "inference": "We need to arrange 8 women in 8 rocking chairs and 2 men in 2 stools.  The order of the women matters only if they are distinguishable. Since the women are indistinguishable, and the rocking chairs are indistinguishable, the number of arrangements of the women in the rocking chairs is 1.\n\nSimilarly, the order of the men matters only if they are distinguishable. Since the men are indistinguishable, and the stools are indistinguishable, the number of arrangements of the men in the stools is 1.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of ways to arrange the 8 rocking chairs and 2 stools in a row.  This is equivalent to arranging 8 indistinguishable objects (rocking chairs) and 2 indistinguishable objects (stools) in a row.\nUsing the formula for permutations with repetitions, the number of ways is:\n$$\\frac{(8+2)!}{8!2!} = \\frac{10!}{8!2!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$",
