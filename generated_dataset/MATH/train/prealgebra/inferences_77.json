        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA tank is to be filled with water. When the tank is one-sixth full, 130 gallons of water are added, making the tank three-fifths full. How many gallons does the tank contain when it is completely full?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the total capacity of the tank in gallons.\nWhen the tank is one-sixth full, it contains (1/6)x gallons.\nAdding 130 gallons makes the tank three-fifths full, so the amount of water in the tank is now (3/5)x gallons.\nThe equation representing this situation is:\n(1/6)x + 130 = (3/5)x\nTo solve for x, first subtract (1/6)x from both sides of the equation:\n130 = (3/5)x - (1/6)x\nNow find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 30:\n130 = (18/30)x - (5/30)x\n130 = (13/30)x\nNow multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (13/30), which is (30/13):\n130 * (30/13) = x\nx = (130 * 30) / 13\nx = 3900 / 13\nx = 300\nThe tank contains 300 gallons when it is completely full.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{300}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The difference between three-fifths full and one-sixth full is $\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity.  Let $x$ be the capacity of the tank in gallons.  Since $\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity is 130 gallons, we have $\\frac{13}{30}x = 130$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{30}{13}$ gives $x = 300$, so the capacity is $\\boxed{300}$ gallons."
