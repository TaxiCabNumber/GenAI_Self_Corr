At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe number of white balls and red balls in a jar is in the ratio of $3:2$. If there are 9 white balls, how many red balls are there?",
        "inference": "Let $W$ be the number of white balls and $R$ be the number of red balls.\nThe ratio of white balls to red balls is $3:2$.\nThis means $\\frac{W}{R} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nGiven that there are 9 white balls, $W = 9$.\nSubstituting this value into the ratio, we get:\n$\\frac{9}{R} = \\frac{3}{2}$\nCross-multiplying, we have:\n$9 \\times 2 = 3 \\times R$\n$18 = 3R$\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n$R = \\frac{18}{3} = 6$\nThus, there are 6 red balls.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "For every 3 white balls in the jar, there are 2 red balls in the jar. Since there are 9 white balls in the jar, which is 3 groups of 3 white balls, there must be 3 groups of 2 red balls in the jar. Thus, there are $3\\times2 =\\boxed{6}$ red balls in the jar."
