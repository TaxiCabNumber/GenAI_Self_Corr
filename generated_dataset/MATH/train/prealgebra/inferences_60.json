        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBob is trying to decide between two cell phone plans. Plan A has no flat fee, but the user must pay $10$ cents per minute on the phone. Plan B requires a one-time fee of $\\$20$, but only requires a payment of $5$ cents per minute on the phone. What is the minimum whole number of minutes Bob has to use the phone for to make Plan B the cheaper plan?",
        "inference": "Let $m$ be the number of minutes Bob uses the phone.\nPlan A cost is $0.10m$.\nPlan B cost is $20 + 0.05m$.\nWe want to find the minimum whole number of minutes $m$ such that Plan B is cheaper than Plan A.\n$20 + 0.05m < 0.10m$\n$20 < 0.10m - 0.05m$\n$20 < 0.05m$\n$m > \\frac{20}{0.05}$\n$m > \\frac{2000}{5}$\n$m > 400$\nThe minimum whole number of minutes is $401$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{401}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes that Bob anticipates using. Plan A costs $10x$ cents, while Plan B costs $2000 + 5x$ cents. We therefore have the inequality \\begin{align*}\n2000+5x &< 10x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2000 &< 5x \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 400 &< x.\n\\end{align*} The smallest integer $x$ such that $400 < x$ is $401$. Therefore, Bob must use at least $\\boxed{401}$ minutes to make Plan B cheaper."
