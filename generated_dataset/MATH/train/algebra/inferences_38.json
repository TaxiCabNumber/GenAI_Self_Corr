At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA triangle has three sides of the following side lengths: $7$, $10$, and $x^2$. What are all of the positive integer values of $x$ such that the triangle exists? Separate your answers using commas and express them in increasing order.",
        "inference": "By the triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.  The three sides are 7, 10, and $x^2$.\n\nCase 1: $7 + 10 > x^2$\n$17 > x^2$\n$x^2 < 17$\nThis implies $x^2 \\le 16$ since $x$ is an integer.\nSo, $x \\le 4$. Possible values of $x$ are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nCase 2: $7 + x^2 > 10$\n$x^2 > 3$\n$x^2 \\ge 4$\nThis implies $x \\ge 2$ or $x \\le -2$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, $x \\ge 2$.\n\nCase 3: $10 + x^2 > 7$\n$x^2 > -3$\nThis is always true for any real $x$.\n\nCombining the conditions, we have $2 \\le x \\le 4$ and $x$ is an integer.

        "ground_truth": "For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \\to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \\to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \\to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$.
