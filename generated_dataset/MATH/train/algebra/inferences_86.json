At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA geometric sequence of positive integers is formed for which the first term is 2 and the fifth term is 162. What is the sixth term of the sequence?",
        "inference": "Let the geometric sequence be denoted by $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, ...$.\nGiven that the first term is 2, so $a_1 = 2$.\nThe fifth term is 162, so $a_5 = 162$.\nIn a geometric sequence, $a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}$, where $r$ is the common ratio.\nThus, $a_5 = a_1 r^{5-1} = a_1 r^4$.\nGiven $a_1 = 2$ and $a_5 = 162$, we have $162 = 2 r^4$.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get $r^4 = 81$.\nSince we are dealing with positive integers, we have $r = \\sqrt[4]{81} = 3$.\nThe sixth term is given by $a_6 = a_1 r^{6-1} = a_1 r^5$.\nSubstituting the values, $a_6 = 2 \\times 3^5 = 2 \\times 243 = 486$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{486}$\n",
