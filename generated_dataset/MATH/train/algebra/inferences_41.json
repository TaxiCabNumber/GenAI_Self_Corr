At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nKaren drove continuously from 9:40 a.m. until 1:20 p.m. of the same day and covered a distance of 165 miles. What was her average speed in miles per hour?",
        "inference": "1. Calculate the total time in hours:\n   From 9:40 a.m. to 1:20 p.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes. Convert 40 minutes to hours: 40 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2/3 hours.\n   Total time = 3 hours + 2/3 hours = 11/3 hours.\n\n2. Calculate the average speed:\n   Average speed = Total distance / Total time\n   Average speed = 165 miles / (11/3 hours) = 165 miles * (3/11 hours) = 15 * 3 miles/hour = 45 miles/hour.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Average speed is defined as distance traveled divided by time traveled. Karen drove 165 miles in $3\\frac{40}{60}=3\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ hours, so her average speed was $\\frac{165}{\\frac{11}{3}}=3\\cdot15=\\boxed{45}$ miles per hour."
