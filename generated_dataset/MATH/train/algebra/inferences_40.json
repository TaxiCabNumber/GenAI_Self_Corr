At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$, where $t$ is the time after launch. What is the maximum height of the ball, in feet?",
        "inference": "To find the maximum height, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The equation is in the form of a quadratic, $h(t) = -16t^2 + 64t + 31$.  The t-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $at^2 + bt + c$ is given by $t = -\\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -16$ and $b = 64$, so $t = -\\frac{64}{2(-16)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\n\nNow we substitute $t = 2$ into the height equation to find the maximum height:\n$h(2) = -16(2)^2 + 64(2) + 31 = -16(4) + 128 + 31 = -64 + 128 + 31 = 64 + 31 = 95$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{95}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+64t+31$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+64t+31=-16(t^2-4t)+31.\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-4/2)^2=4$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-4t)+31&=-16(t^2-4t+4-4)+31\\\\\n&=-16([t-2]^2-4)+31\\\\\n&=-16(t-2)^2+95.\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+95=\\boxed{95}$ feet."
