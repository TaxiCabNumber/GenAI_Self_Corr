I hope it is correct.'\nKrzysztof solved the quadratic equation $11x^2-44x-99=0$ by completing the square. In the process, he came up with the equivalent equation $$(x+r)^2 = s,$$where $r$ and $s$ are constants.\n\nWhat is $r+s$?",

Take half of the coefficient of the x term (-4), square it, and add it to both sides:\n   $x^2 - 4x + (-4/2)^2 = 9 + (-4/2)^2$\n   $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 9 + 4$\n   $(x-2)^2 = 13$\nComparing this to the given form $(x+r)^2 = s$, we have $r = -2$ and $s = 13$.\n4.
