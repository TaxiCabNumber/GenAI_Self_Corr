At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe center of the circle with equation $x^2+y^2=-2x-10y-16$ is the point $(x,y)$. What is $x+y$?",
        "inference": "1. Rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.\n$x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 10y + 16 = 0$\nComplete the square for the x terms and y terms:\n$(x^2 + 2x) + (y^2 + 10y) = -16$\n$(x^2 + 2x + 1) + (y^2 + 10y + 25) = -16 + 1 + 25$\n$(x+1)^2 + (y+5)^2 = 10$\nThe equation is now in the standard form, with center (-1, -5).\n2.

        "ground_truth": "We will complete the square to determine the standard form equation of the circle. Shifting all but the constant term from the RHS to the LHS, we have $x^2+2x+y^2+10y=-16$. Completing the square in $x$, we add $(2/2)^2=1$ to both sides. Completing the square in $y$, we add $(10/2)^2=25$ to both sides. The equation becomes \\begin{align*}\nx^2+2x+y^2+10y&=-16\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x^2+2x+1+y^2+10y+25&=10\\\\\n\\Rightarrow (x+1)^2+(y+5)^2&=10\n\\end{align*} Thus, the center of the circle is at point $(-1,-5)$ so $x+y=-1+(-5)=\\boxed{-6}$."
