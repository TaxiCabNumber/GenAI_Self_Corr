        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBerengere and her American foreign-exchange student Emily are at a bakery in Paris that accepts both euros and American dollars. They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?",
        "inference": "1. Convert the American five-dollar bill to euros: 5 USD * (1 euro / 1.25 USD) = 4 euros.\n2. Subtract the amount Emily contributed from the total cost of the cake: 6 euros - 4 euros = 2 euros.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert everything into euros. Emily's five-dollar bill is equivalent to $5\\text{ USD} \\times \\frac{1\\text{ euro}}{1.25\\text{ USD}}=4\\text{ euros}$. Since the girls need 6 euros between them, Berengere must contribute $6-4=\\boxed{2 \\text{ euros}}$."
