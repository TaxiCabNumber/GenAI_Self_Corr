        "inference": "To find the center of the circle, we need to complete the square for both the x and y terms.\nThe given equation is $x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y = 9$.\nFor the x terms, we have $x^2 - 6x$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of x, which is -6/2 = -3, and square it, (-3)^2 = 9.\nFor the y terms, we have $y^2 + 2y$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of y, which is 2/2 = 1, and square it, (1)^2 = 1.\nAdding 9 and 1 to both sides of the equation gives:\n$x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 9 + 9 + 1$\n$(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) = 19$\n$(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$\nThis is the equation of a circle in the standard form $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius.\nComparing the equation to the standard form, we see that the center of the circle is (3, -1).\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{(3, -1)}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Completing the square, we get $(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 19$. Therefore, the center of the circle is $\\boxed{(3, -1)}$."
