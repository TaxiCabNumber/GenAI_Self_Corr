At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nLet $C$ be the circle with equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$. If $(a,b)$ is the center of $C$ and $r$ is its radius, what is the value of $a+b+r$?",

Complete the square for the $x$ terms and the $y$ terms:\n$(x^2 + 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) = 3 + 4 + 9$\n$(x+2)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 16$\n\n3. Identify the center $(a,b)$ and the radius $r$.\nThe equation is in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, so the center is $(-2, 3)$ and the radius is $r = \\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\n4.

        "ground_truth": "We can rewrite the equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$ as $x^2+4x+y^2-6y=3$. Completing the square, we have $(x+2)^2-4+(y-3)^2-9=3$, or $(x+2)^2+(y-3)^2=16$. This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=4$ and with center $(a,b)=(-2,3)$. Therefore, $a+b+r=-2+3+4=\\boxed{5}$."
