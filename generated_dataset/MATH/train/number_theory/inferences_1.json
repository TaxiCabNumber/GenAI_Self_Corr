At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "To make $x$ a perfect square, we need to find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square.  We can rewrite $x$ as a product of primes:\n$x = 2^2 3^3 4^4 5^5 6^6 7^7 8^8 9^9 = 2^2 3^3 (2^2)^4 5^5 (2 \\cdot 3)^6 7^7 (2^3)^8 (3^2)^9$\n$= 2^2 3^3 2^8 5^5 2^6 3^6 7^7 2^{24} 3^{18}$\n$= 2^{2^2 + 8 + 6 + 24} 3^{3 + 6 + 18} 5^5 7^7 = 2^{42} 3^{27} 5^5 7^7$\n\nTo make $x$ a perfect square, the exponents of each prime factor must be even.  We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^{42} 3^{27} 5^5 7^7 k$ is a perfect square.\nThe exponents of $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ are $42, 27, 5, 7$, respectively. To make these exponents even, we need to multiply by $2^{42-41} 3^{27-26} 5^{5-4} 7^{7-6} = 2^1 3^1 5^1 7^1$. \n$k = 2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 210$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{210}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$."
