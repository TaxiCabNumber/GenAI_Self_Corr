At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA band has 72 members who will all be marching during halftime. They need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible row-lengths can the band be arranged?",
        "inference": "The number of students in the band is 72.\nThe number of students per row must be between 5 and 20, inclusive.\nThe number of students per row must be a divisor of 72.\nThe divisors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\nThe divisors between 5 and 20 are 6, 8, 9, 12, 18.\nThere are 5 possible row-lengths.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\\cdot3^2$. Given that $5\\le x\\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \\boxed{5}$ row-lengths."
