        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nBase prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows. Each place in a base prime represents a prime number, and it is occupied by the corresponding exponent of that prime, starting on the right side with the smallest prime number and proceeding to the left with the next largest prime number. For instance, since $84 = 7^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2$, then $84$ would be written as $1012$ in base prime. What is $225$ written in base prime?",
        "inference": "$225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2 \\times 2^0$.\nIn base prime, the smallest prime is 2, followed by 3, then 5, etc.\nThe exponent of 2 is 0.\nThe exponent of 3 is 2.\nThe exponent of 5 is 2.\nSo, $225$ in base prime is $022$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{220}$",
        "ground_truth": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$"

        "inference": "225 in base prime means we write it as a sum of powers of primes.  The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.  \n$225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$\nSince 2 is the smallest prime, the exponent of 2 is 0.\nThe exponent of 3 is 2.\nThe exponent of 5 is 2.\nThis gives us the representation $2^0 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$.\nThus, in base prime, $225$ is represented as $022$.  We write the exponents of the primes in increasing order of the primes. Thus, the representation is 022, which corresponds to $2^0 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2$.\nThe correct representation in base prime is $2^03^25^2$.  In base prime, we arrange in order of prime, so the representation is 022.\n$225 = 2^0 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 9 \\times 25 = 225$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{022}$",
