        "inference": "The given expression $AAA_4$ represents a base-4 number.  $AAA_4 = A \\times 4^2 + A \\times 4^1 + A \\times 4^0 = 16A + 4A + A = 21A$.\n\nThe given expression $33_b$ represents a base-$b$ number. $33_b = 3 \\times b^1 + 3 \\times b^0 = 3b + 3$.\n\nWe are given that $AAA_4 = 33_b$, which means $21A = 3b + 3$.\n$7A = b + 1$, so $b = 7A - 1$.\nSince $b$ is a base, $b > 5$. Thus $7A - 1 > 5$, so $7A > 6$.\nThe smallest integer value for $A$ satisfying this inequality is $A=2$, which gives $b = 7(2) - 1 = 13$.\nThus, $A=2$ and $b=13$.\n\nThe sum $A + b = 2 + 13 = 15$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{15}$",
