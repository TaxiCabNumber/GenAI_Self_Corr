        "ground_truth": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds.
