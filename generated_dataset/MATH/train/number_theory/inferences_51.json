        "inference": "We are given that $x$ is a multiple of 23, so $x = 23n$ for some integer $n$. We are also given that $x$ is 4 more than a multiple of 89, so $x = 89m + 4$ for some integer $m$. Combining these equations, we have $23n = 89m + 4$.\nWe need to find the smallest positive integer $n$. This is equivalent to solving the congruence $23n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{89}$.\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n$89 = 3(23) + 20$\n$23 = 1(20) + 3$\n$20 = 6(3) + 2$\n$3 = 1(2) + 1$\nWorking backwards:\n$1 = 3 - 1(2) = 3 - 1(20 - 6(3)) = 7(3) - 1(20) = 7(23 - 1(20)) - 1(20) = 7(23) - 8(20) = 7(23) - 8(89 - 3(23)) = 31(23) - 8(89)$.\nThus, $31(23) - 8(89) = 1$, which means $31(23) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{89}$.\nMultiplying the congruence $23n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{89}$ by 31, we get $31(23n) \\equiv 31(4) \\pmod{89}$.\nThis simplifies to $n \\equiv 124 \\pmod{89}$, which means $n \\equiv 35 \\pmod{89}$.\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ is 35.\nThen $x = 23n = 23(35) = 805$.\nWe check: $805 = 89(9) + 4$, so $x$ is indeed 4 more than a multiple of 89.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{805}$",
