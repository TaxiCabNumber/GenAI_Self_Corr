If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?",

Calculate overtime pay rate: $18.00/hour * 0.5 = $9.00/hour\n\n4. Calculate overtime pay: $9.00/hour * 2 hours = $18.00\n\n5. Calculate total pay for one day: $144.00 + $18.00 = $162.00\n\n6.
