At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

(Assume that the order of the cards does not matter.)",

The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4$.\nThen, for each suit, we choose 1 card from the 13 cards in that suit. The number of ways to do this is $13 \\times 13 \\times 13 = 13^3$.\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 cards from different suits is $\\binom{4}{3} \\times 13^3 = 4 \\times 2197 = 8788$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{8788}$\n",
