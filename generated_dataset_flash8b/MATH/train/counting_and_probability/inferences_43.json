At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nHow many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in EQUALS if each sequence must begin with L, end with Q, and no letter can appear in a sequence more than once?",
        "inference": "1. The sequence must begin with L and end with Q.  This leaves two letters to be placed in the middle two positions.\n2. The letters in EQUALS are E, Q, U, A, L, S.  We have already used L and Q, so the remaining letters are E, U, A, S.\n3. We need to choose 2 letters from the remaining 4 letters (E, U, A, S).\n4. The number of ways to choose 2 letters from 4 is given by the combination formula: $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n5. Once we have chosen 2 letters, there are 2 positions left, and we need to arrange those 2 letters in those 2 positions. This can be done in $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$ ways.\n6. The total number of distinct sequences is the product of the number of ways to choose the 2 letters and the number of ways to arrange them: $6 \\times 2 = 12$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the last must be Q. So the only choices are for the middle two letters. The second letter may be any remaining letter, namely E, U, A or S. Whichever letter we choose for it, for the third letter we must choose one of three remaining letters. So, there are $4 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{12}$ sequences."
