At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nI have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color?",
        "inference": "Total number of plates = 5 red + 4 blue = 9 plates.\nNumber of ways to choose 2 plates from 9 plates = $\\binom{9}{2} = \\frac{9 \\times 8}{2} = 36$.\n\nNumber of ways to choose 2 red plates from 5 red plates = $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$.\nNumber of ways to choose 2 blue plates from 4 blue plates = $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6$.\n\nProbability of choosing 2 plates of the same color = $\\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 red plates} + \\text{Number of ways to choose 2 blue plates}}{\\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 plates}} = \\frac{10 + 6}{36} = \\frac{16}{36} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.

        "ground_truth": "There are ${9 \\choose 2} = 36$ pairs of plates possible in all. Exactly ${5 \\choose 2} = 10$ of these pairs are both red plates and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs are both blue plates for a total of $6+10=16$ pairs of plates that satisfy our condition. So, the probability of the pair of plates being the same color is $\\frac{16}{36}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$."
