At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the minimum number of times you must throw three fair six-sided dice to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice?",
        "inference": "Let $S$ be the set of possible sums of three fair six-sided dice. The minimum sum is $1+1+1=3$ and the maximum sum is $6+6+6=18$. The possible sums are $\\{3, 4, 5, ..., 18\\}$.  The number of possible sums is $18-3+1=16$.\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of throws to guarantee that the same sum is rolled twice. This is a pigeonhole principle problem.  The pigeonholes are the possible sums $\\{3, 4, 5, ..., 18\\}$, and the pigeons are the sums rolled in each throw.  We want the minimum number of throws to ensure that at least one sum is repeated.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, if we have 16 pigeonholes and we throw the dice $n$ times, then the smallest $n$ such that we are guaranteed to have at least two throws with the same sum is $n = 16+1 = 17$.  We have to include the possibility that the first 16 throws have all different sums.\n\nThe first throw could be any sum from 3 to 18. The second throw could be any sum from 3 to 18. The third throw could be any sum from 3 to 18. To ensure that at least two throws have the same sum, we need at least $16 + 1 = 17$ throws.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "In the worst-case scenario, every possible sum is rolled before the same sum is rolled again. The minimum possible sum rolled is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, and the maximum is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$. Every sum in between those two extremes can be created, since the sums are created through adding three of the digits between one and six. Thus, there are $18 - 2 = 16$ possible sums, so the dice must be rolled $\\boxed{17}$ times to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice."
