At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe faces of an octahedral die are labeled with digits $1$ through $8$. What is the probability, expressed as a common fraction, of rolling a sum of $15$ with a pair of such octahedral dice?",
        "inference": "To get a sum of 15 with two octahedral dice, we need to find all possible combinations of numbers from 1 to 8 that sum to 15.  \nPossible pairs are: (7,8), (8,7).\nThe pairs that sum to 15 are (7,8) and (8,7).  \nThere are 8 possible outcomes for the first die and 8 possible outcomes for the second die, so there are $8 \\times 8 = 64$ total possible outcomes.\nSince there are two pairs that sum to 15, the number of favorable outcomes is 2.\nThe probability is $\\frac{2}{64}$.\nSimplifying the fraction, we get $\\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "There are 8 digits upon which the die can land in the first roll and 8 digits upon which the die can land in the second roll. Thus, there are $8 \\cdot 8 = 64 $ pairs of digits that can result from two rolls. Of these, only two will produce a sum of 15: 8 and 7 or 7 and 8. Thus, the probability of rolling a 15 is $\\frac{2}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}$."
