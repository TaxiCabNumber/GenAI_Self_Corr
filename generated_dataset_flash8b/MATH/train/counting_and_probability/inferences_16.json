At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\n4 12-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that the number of dice showing a two digit number is equal to the number of dice showing a one digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction. (Assume that the numbers on the 12 sides are the numbers from 1 to 12 expressed in decimal.)",
        "inference": "Let $X$ be the number of dice showing a two-digit number.\nThe possible outcomes for each die are the integers from 1 to 12. The one-digit numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. There are 9 one-digit numbers.\nThe two-digit numbers are 10, 11, 12. There are 3 two-digit numbers.\nThe probability of a die showing a one-digit number is $P(\\text{one-digit}) = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe probability of a die showing a two-digit number is $P(\\text{two-digit}) = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nWe are rolling 4 dice. We want to find the probability that the number of dice showing a two-digit number is equal to the number of dice showing a one-digit number. This means $X = 2$.\nWe use the binomial probability formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhere $n=4$ is the number of trials, $k=2$ is the number of successes, and $p=\\frac{1}{4}$ is the probability of a die showing a two-digit number.\n$$P(X=2) = \\binom{4}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right) \\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right) = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{54}{256} = \\frac{27}{128}$$\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{27}{128}}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since 9 out of the 12 possible results are one digit numbers, each die will show a one digit number with probability of $\\frac{3}{4}$ and a two digit number with probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$.
