At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nJason is trying to remember the five digit combination to his safe.  He knows that he only used digits 1 through 5 (possibly repeated), that every even digit was followed by an odd digit, and every odd digit was followed by an even digit.  How many possible combinations does Jason need to try?",
        "inference": "The combination is 5 digits long.\nEven digits are 2, 4.\nOdd digits are 1, 3, 5.\nThe first digit can be any of the 5 digits.\nIf the first digit is even (2 or 4), the second digit must be odd (1, 3, or 5).\nIf the first digit is odd (1, 3, or 5), the second digit must be even (2 or 4).\nThis pattern continues for the remaining digits.\nIf the first digit is even, the second digit is odd, the third digit is even, the fourth digit is odd, and the fifth digit is even.\nIf the first digit is odd, the second digit is even, the third digit is odd, the fourth digit is even, and the fifth digit is odd.\nCase 1: The first digit is even. There are 2 choices (2 or 4).\nThe second digit must be odd. There are 3 choices (1, 3, or 5).\nThe third digit must be even. There are 2 choices (2 or 4).\nThe fourth digit must be odd. There are 3 choices (1, 3, or 5).\nThe fifth digit must be even. There are 2 choices (2 or 4).\nThe number of combinations in this case is 2 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 = 72.\nCase 2: The first digit is odd. There are 3 choices (1, 3, or 5).\nThe second digit must be even. There are 2 choices (2 or 4).\nThe third digit must be odd. There are 3 choices (1, 3, or 5).\nThe fourth digit must be even. There are 2 choices (2 or 4).\nThe fifth digit must be odd. There are 3 choices (1, 3, or 5).\nThe number of combinations in this case is 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 108.\nThe total number of possible combinations is 72 + 108 = 180.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{180}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Of the digits 1 through 5, three are odd and two are even.  If Jason's combination started with an odd digit, there would be 3 possibilities for the first digit.  Since an even digit must follow, there would be 2 possibilities for the second digit.  Similarly, there would be 3 possibilities for the third digit, and so on.  This would be a total of: $$3\\times2\\times3\\times2\\times3=108$$We can apply the same logic if Jason's combination started with an even digit.  There would be 2 possibilities for the first digit, 3 for the second digit, and so on, for a total of : $$2\\times3\\times2\\times3\\times2=72$$Overall, Jason must try $72+108=\\boxed{180}$ combinations."
