At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nForty slips are placed into a hat, each bearing a number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, with each number entered on four slips. Four slips are drawn from the hat at random and without replacement. Let $p$ be the probability that all four slips bear the same number. Let $q$ be the probability that two of the slips bear a number $a$ and the other two bear a number $b\\ne a$. What is the value of $q/p$?",
        "inference": "To find the probability that all four slips bear the same number, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 slips with the same number and divide by the total number of ways to choose 4 slips.  There are 10 numbers, and each number appears on 4 slips.  The number of ways to choose 4 slips with the same number is 10. The number of ways to choose 4 slips from 40 is $\\binom{40}{4}$.  So, $p = \\frac{10}{\\binom{40}{4}}$.\n\nNext, we find the probability that two slips bear a number $a$ and two slips bear a number $b \\ne a$.  We choose two numbers $a$ and $b$ in $\\binom{10}{2}$ ways.  For each pair $(a, b)$, there are $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 slips with number $a$ and $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose 2 slips with number $b$.
