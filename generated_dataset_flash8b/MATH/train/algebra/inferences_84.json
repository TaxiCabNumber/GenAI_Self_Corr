        "inference": "Let the geometric sequence be $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, ...$.\nThe first term is $a_1 = 3$.\nThe fourth term is $a_4 = 192$.\nThe general form of a geometric sequence is $a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\nWe have $a_1 = 3$ and $a_4 = 192$.\nUsing the formula, we have $a_4 = a_1 r^{4-1} = a_1 r^3$.\nSubstituting the given values, we get $192 = 3 r^3$.\nDividing both sides by 3, we get $r^3 = \\frac{192}{3} = 64$.\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we get $r = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$.\nNow we need to find the third term, $a_3$.\n$a_3 = a_1 r^{3-1} = a_1 r^2 = 3 \\times 4^2 = 3 \\times 16 = 48$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{48}$\n",
