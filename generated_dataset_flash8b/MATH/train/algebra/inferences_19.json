        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThree faucets fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes.  How long, in seconds, does it take six faucets to fill a 25-gallon tub?  Assume that all faucets dispense water at the same rate.",
        "inference": "1. Three faucets fill 100 gallons in 6 minutes.  This means each faucet fills 100 gallons / 3 faucets = 100/3 gallons per 6 minutes.\n\n2.  To find the rate per minute, divide by 6: (100/3) gallons / 6 minutes = 100/18 gallons per minute.\n\n3.  Each faucet fills 100/18 gallons per minute.  Six faucets fill 6 * (100/18) = 600/18 gallons per minute.\n\n4. Six faucets fill 25 gallons at a rate of 600/18 gallons per minute.  To find the time, divide the amount of water by the rate: 25 gallons / (600/18 gallons/minute) = 25 * 18 / 600 minutes.\n\n5. Converting to seconds: (25 * 18 / 600) minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 4500/600 seconds = 7.5 seconds.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7.5}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "Since three faucets can fill a 100-gallon tub in 6 minutes, six can do it twice as fast, i.e. 3 minutes.  Additionally, the tub is a quarter the size and thus it will be filled four times as fast which gives $3/4$ minutes or $\\boxed{45}$ seconds."
