        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA line has a slope of $-7$ and contains the point $(3,0)$. The equation of this line can be written in the form $y = mx+b$. What is the value of $m+b$?",
        "inference": "1. We are given the slope $m = -7$ and a point $(3,0)$.\n2. Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we have $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.\n3. Plugging in the given values, we get $y - 0 = -7(x - 3)$.\n4. Simplifying the equation, we have $y = -7x + 21$.\n5. Comparing this to the form $y = mx + b$, we have $m = -7$ and $b = 21$.\n6. We need to find $m + b$.\n7. $m + b = -7 + 21 = 14$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{14}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "First, remember that the slope of a line in the form of $y=mx+b$ is equal to $m$.  So, the line must take the form $y=-7x+b$.  Next, substitute the point $(3,0)$ and solve for $b$: \\begin{align*}\n0&=-7(3)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-21+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 21&=b\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the value of $m+b$ is $-7+21=\\boxed{14}$."
