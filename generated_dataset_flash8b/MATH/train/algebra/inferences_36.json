At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe perimeter of a rectangular garden is 60 feet. If the length of the field is twice the width, what is the area of the field, in square feet?",
        "inference": "Let the width of the rectangular garden be 'w' feet.\nThe length of the garden is twice the width, so the length is '2w' feet.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).\nGiven that the perimeter is 60 feet, we have:\n60 = 2(2w + w)\n60 = 2(3w)\n60 = 6w\nw = 10 feet\nThe width is 10 feet.\nThe length is 2 * 10 = 20 feet.\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = length * width.\nA = 20 * 10 = 200 square feet.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{200}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "If the length is $l$ and the width is $w$, then the perimeter is $2l+2w$. We can set up the equations $2l+2w=60 \\Rightarrow l+w=30$ and $l=2w$. Now we substitute $l$ in terms of $w$ into the first equation and get $l+w=2w+w=30$, so $w=10$ and $l=2(10)=20$. That means the area of the rectangular garden is $lw=20(10)=\\boxed{200}$ square feet."
