I hope it is correct.'\nIsosceles triangle $ABE$ of area 100 square inches is cut by $\\overline{CD}$ into an isosceles trapezoid and a smaller isosceles triangle. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square inches. If the altitude of triangle $ABE$ from $A$ is 20 inches, what is the number of inches in the length of $\\overline{CD}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-9,0)--(0,24)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-6,8)--(6,8));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,24),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-9,0),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-6,8),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(6,8),NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(9,0),E);\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "1. The area of triangle ABE is 100 square inches. The altitude from A is 20 inches.  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.  So, 100 = (1/2) * base * 20.  Solving for the base BE, we get BE = 10 inches.\n\n2. Since triangle ABE is isosceles, AB = AE = x.  Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABF (where F is the foot of the altitude from A to BE), we get x^2 = 10^2 + 20^2  = 500. Thus, x = 10\u221a5 inches.\n  This means the base of triangle ABE is 10.\n3. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square inches. The area of a trapezoid is (1/2)(b1 + b2)h, where b1 and b2 are the parallel bases and h is the height. In this case, the bases of the trapezoid are CD and BE, and the height is the same as the altitude of triangle ABE from A, which is 20 inches. So, 75 = (1/2)(CD + 10)(20).\n\n4. Simplifying, we get 75 = 10(CD + 10).  Dividing by 10 gives 7.5 = CD + 10.\n\n5. Solving for CD, we get CD = 7.5 - 10 = -2.5. However, a length cannot be negative, so we made a mistake earlier. The trapezoid's area should be (1/2) * (base1+base2) * height.\n75 = 10 * (CD+10). So 7.5 = (CD + 10)/2. This is incorrect. Let the height of the trapezoid be y, then 75 = 0.5 * (10 + CD) * y. Since y is the altitude of ABE, y = 20 inches. Thus, 75 = 0.5 * (10 + CD) * 20. This simplifies to 7.5 = CD + 5, so CD = 2.5.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2.5}$",
        "ground_truth": "The area of triangle $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(BE)(20\\text{ in.})$. Setting this equal to $100$ square inches we find $BE=10$ inches.  The area of triangle $ACD$ is $100-75=25$ square inches.  Since triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ and the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, $CD=\\frac{1}{2}BE=\\boxed{5}$ inches.\n\nAlternatively, because triangles $ACD$ and $ABE$ are similar, the height-to-base ratio is the same for each of them.  In triangle $ABE$, this ratio is $\\frac{20\\text{ in.}}{10\\text{ in.}}=2$.  Therefore, the height of $ACD$ is $2\\cdot CD$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\cdot CD)(CD)=25\\text{ in.}^2$ we find $CD=5$ inches."
