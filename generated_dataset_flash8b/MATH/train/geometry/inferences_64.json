        "inference": "Let $AD = 2x$ and $AB = x$. The altitude from $F$ to $EG$ is 7 inches, and the length of $EG$ is 10 inches. The area of triangle $EFG$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(10)(7) = 35$.  The area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $2x^2$.\nSince $AD$ is on $EG$, the height of the rectangle is $x$.  From the similar triangles, $\\frac{2x}{10} = \\frac{x}{y}$, which gives $2y = 10$, so $y = 5$.  Let the height of the inscribed rectangle be $h$.  Then $\\frac{7-h}{10} = \\frac{h}{2x}$. Thus $10h = 14x - hx$, so $h = \\frac{14x}{10+x} = \\frac{7x}{5+x/2}$. Also, we have the similar triangles $\\frac{h}{7} = \\frac{x}{5}$, so $h = \\frac{7x}{5}$.  Substituting $h$ in the first equation gives $\\frac{7x}{5} = \\frac{7x}{5+x/2}$. This is true if $5+x/2 = 5$, which gives $x/2=0$ or $x=0$. This is not correct.\n\nThe relation $h = 7 - \\frac{10 h}{2x}$ should lead to a relation between $h$ and $x$.  The other relationship is $\\frac{h}{7} = \\frac{x}{5}$, which leads to $h = \\frac{7x}{5}$. Substituting this into $7-h = \\frac{10 h}{2x}$, we get $7 - \\frac{7x}{5} = \\frac{5}{x} \\frac{7x}{5} = \\frac{7}{x}$. This implies $7-\\frac{7x}{5} = \\frac{7x}{x}$.\nSubstituting $h = \\frac{7x}{5}$ into $\\frac{7-h}{10} = \\frac{h}{2x}$ gives $\\frac{7-\\frac{7x}{5}}{10} = \\frac{\\frac{7x}{5}}{2x}$. Then $\\frac{35-7x}{50} = \\frac{7x}{10x} = \\frac{7}{10}$. This gives $35-7x = 35$, so $7x = 0$, which again is wrong.\n\nFrom the similar triangles, $\\frac{2x}{10} = \\frac{x}{5}$ and $\\frac{h}{7} = \\frac{x}{5}$, so $h = \\frac{7x}{5}$.  Then, $\\frac{7-h}{10} = \\frac{x}{5}$, or $\\frac{7-\\frac{7x}{5}}{10} = \\frac{x}{5}$. This gives $35-7x = 10x$, so $17x = 35$. Then $x = 35/17$.\n$2x^2 = 2(35/17)^2 = 2(1225/289) = 2450/289$.\n$2x^2 = 2\\left(\\frac{35}{17}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2450}{289}$. The area of the rectangle is $\\frac{2\\times35^2}{17^2} = \\frac{2(1225)}{289} = \\frac{2450}{289}$.\n\n$2x^2 = 2(\\frac{35}{17})^2 = \\frac{2450}{289}$.\n$2x^2 = \\frac{700}{17^2} = 2(\\frac{35}{17})^2 = \\frac{2450}{289} = 2(\\frac{35}{17})^2$.\n2\\times(35/17)^2 = 2\\times (1225/289) = 2450/289  \nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{49/2}$",
