At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTriangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(1, -3)$, $B(-2, 0)$ and $C(4, 3)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $A$ to $A'$?",
        "inference": "Reflecting a point $(x, y)$ over the y-axis gives the point $(-x, y)$.\n$A(1, -3)$ reflected over the y-axis becomes $A'(-1, -3)$.\nThe length of the segment $AA'$ is given by the distance formula:\n$AA' = \\sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + (-3 - (-3))^2} = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (0)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 0} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{2}$ I hope it is correct.",
        "ground_truth": "Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coefficient.  So if $A$ is $(1,-3)$, $A'$ will be $(-1, -3)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $1+1=\\boxed{2}$."
