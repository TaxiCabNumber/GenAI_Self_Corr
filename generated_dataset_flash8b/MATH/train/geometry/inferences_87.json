        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
        "inference": "The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is $360$ degrees.\nIf the exterior angle is $15$ degrees, then the number of sides is $\\frac{360}{15} = 24$.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{24}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex. The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees. If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$. So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\\boxed{24}$ sides."
