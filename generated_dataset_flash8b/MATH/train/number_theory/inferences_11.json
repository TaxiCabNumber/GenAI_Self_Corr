At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}.

This is not a single-digit integer, so this is not possible.\nSo the only possible value for $n$ is 5.\nChecking the alternating sum, $16-5 = 11$, which is a multiple of 11.\nThus, the number is $8545526$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$."
