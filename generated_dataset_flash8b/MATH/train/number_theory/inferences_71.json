At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nFor a certain natural number $n$, $n^2$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, and $n^3$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. What remainder does $n$ give when divided by 5?",
        "inference": "If $n^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, then $n^2$ can be 4 or 9 or 14 or...\nThus, $n^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ implies $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ or $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nIf $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, then $n^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$.\nIf $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$, then $n^3 \\equiv 3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nTherefore, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ is the solution.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{3}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5.  From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$.  Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5.  Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition. Therefore, we may assume that $0\\leq n <5$.  Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5."
