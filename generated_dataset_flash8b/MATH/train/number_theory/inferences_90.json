At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nTom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
        "inference": "The number of students is 288.\nThe number of rows is at least 10.\nThe number of students in each row is at least 15.\nThe number of students must divide 288.\nThe possible values of $x$ are the divisors of 288 greater than or equal to 15.\nThe divisors of 288 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288.\nThe divisors greater than or equal to 15 are 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288.\nThe sum of the possible values of $x$ is 16 + 18 + 24 + 32 + 36 + 48 + 72 + 96 + 144 + 288 = 800.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{780}$",
        "ground_truth": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$."
