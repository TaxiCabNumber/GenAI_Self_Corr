        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWe know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
        "inference": "$Z = K \\times K^2 = K^3$.  We are given that $500 < Z < 1000$, so $500 < K^3 < 1000$.  Taking the cube root of all parts of the inequality, we get $\\sqrt[3]{500} < K < \\sqrt[3]{1000}$.  $\\sqrt[3]{500} \\approx 7.937$, and $\\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10$.  Thus, $7.937 < K < 10$.  Since $K$ is an integer and $K > 1$, the only integer values for $K$ are 8 and 9.\nIf $K=8$, then $Z=8^3=512$.  If $K=9$, then $Z=9^3=729$.  Both $512$ and $729$ are perfect squares. We are looking for the value of K for which $Z$ is a perfect square.  However, $512 = 2^9$ and $729 = 3^6$.  Neither $512$ nor $729$ is a perfect square, so there is no integer value for K that satisfies the conditions.  The question is poorly worded.\n\nThe problem states $Z = K \\times K^2 = K^3$.  For $Z$ to be a perfect square, $K^3$ must be a perfect square.  For this to occur, the exponent 3 must be an even integer, which it is not.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{no solution}$",
        "ground_truth": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$"
