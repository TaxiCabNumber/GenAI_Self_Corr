At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe NASA Space Shuttle transports material to the International Space Station at a cost of $\\$22,\\!000$ per kilogram. What is the number of dollars in the cost of transporting a 250 g control module?",
        "inference": "1. Convert grams to kilograms: 250 g = 0.25 kg\n\n2. Calculate the cost: $22,000/kg * 0.25 kg = $5,500\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{$5500}$. I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Two hundred fifty grams is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a kilogram.  Therefore, the cost of transporting a 250 g control module is $\\$22,\\!000/4=\\boxed{5500}$ dollars."
