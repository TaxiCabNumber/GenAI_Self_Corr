At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nDon has a bottle of milk with $\\frac{1}{5}$ of a gallon of milk in it. Don's friend Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the milk he has. How many gallons of milk did Rachel drink?",

        "ground_truth": "Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3}$ of Don's $\\frac{1}{5}$ of a gallon of milk. The word \"of\" means multiply, so Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}$ gallons of milk. Multiplying, we get $\\frac{(2)(1)}{(3)(5)}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{15}}$ gallons."
