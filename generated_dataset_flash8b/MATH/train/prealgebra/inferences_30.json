        "inference": "1. The perimeter of square A is $24$ cm.  Since the perimeter of a square is $4s$ where $s$ is the side length, we have $4s = 24$, so $s = 6$ cm.\n2. The area of square A is $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$ square cm.\n3. The area of square B is one-fourth the area of square A, so the area of square B is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9$ square cm.\n4. Let $s_B$ be the side length of square B.  The area of square B is $s_B^2 = 9$.\n5. Taking the square root of both sides gives $s_B = 3$ cm.\n6.

        "ground_truth": "Since square $A$ has a perimeter of 24 cm and all its sides are equal in length, each side measures $24/4=6$ cm. The area of square $A$ is thus $6\\cdot6=36$ square cm. Thus, the area of square $B$ is $36/4=9$ square cm. So each side of square $B$ measures $\\sqrt{9}=3$ cm. Finally, the perimeter of square $B$ is $4\\cdot3=\\boxed{12}$ cm."
