        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nGrandma gave Bryce and Carter some raisins. Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, and Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce received. How many raisins did Bryce receive?",
        "inference": "Let 'x' be the number of raisins Carter received.\nBryce received 6 more than Carter, so Bryce received 'x + 6' raisins.\nCarter received half the number of raisins Bryce received, so x = (x + 6)/2.\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get 2x = x + 6.\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get x = 6.\nCarter received 6 raisins.\nBryce received x + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12 raisins.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{12}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "Let the number of raisins Bryce received be $x$. Since Bryce received 6 more raisins than Carter, Carter received $x-6$ raisins. Since Carter received half the number of raisins Bryce did, Carter also received $x/2$ raisins. We have two ways of expressing the number of raisins Carter received, so we have the equation $x-6=x/2$, or $x=12$. Thus, Bryce received $\\boxed{12}$ raisins."
