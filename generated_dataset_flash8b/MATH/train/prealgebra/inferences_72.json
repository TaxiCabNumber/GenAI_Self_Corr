        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe complement of an angle is $5^{\\circ}$ more than four times the angle. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the angle?",
        "inference": "Let the angle be $x$.\nThe complement of the angle is $90^{\\circ} - x$.\nThe complement of the angle is $5^{\\circ}$ more than four times the angle, so\n$90^{\\circ} - x = 4x + 5^{\\circ}$\n$90^{\\circ} - 5^{\\circ} = 4x + x$\n$85^{\\circ} = 5x$\n$x = \\frac{85^{\\circ}}{5}$\n$x = 17^{\\circ}$\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{17}$",
        "ground_truth": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\\circ$.  Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\\circ) = 90^\\circ$.  Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\\circ = 90^\\circ$, so $5x = 85^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{17^\\circ}$."
