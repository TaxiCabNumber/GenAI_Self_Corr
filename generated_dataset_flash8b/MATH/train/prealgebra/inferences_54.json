I hope it is correct.'\nA 4-inch by 6-inch picture is enlarged for framing  by tripling its dimensions.  A 2-inch-wide border  is then placed around each side of the enlarged  picture, as shown.  Thin metal framing is sold only  in increments of one foot.  What is the minimum  number of linear feet of framing that must be  purchased to go around the perimeter of the border?\n\n[asy]\n\ndraw((0,0)--(14,0)--(14,20)--(0,20)--cycle,linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((4,4)--(10,4)--(10,16)--(4,16)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"border\",(7,17),N);\n\nlabel(\"picture\",(7,8),N);\n\nlabel(\"frame\",(14,5),E);\n\ndraw((17.5,7.5)--(14.5,7.5),Arrow);\ndraw((10.5,7.5)--(13.5,7.5),Arrow);\n\n[/asy]",
        "inference": "1. The picture is 4 inches by 6 inches.\n2. It is enlarged by tripling its dimensions, so the enlarged picture is 12 inches by 18 inches.\n3. A 2-inch border is added to each side of the enlarged picture.  This means the outer dimensions of the framed picture are (12 + 2(2)) inches by (18 + 2(2)) inches, which is 16 inches by 22 inches.\n4. The perimeter of the border is 2(16) + 2(22) = 32 + 44 = 76 inches.\n5. To convert inches to feet, divide by 12: 76 inches / 12 inches/foot = 6.333... feet.\n6. Since framing is sold in increments of one foot, the minimum number of linear feet of framing that must be purchased is 7.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{7}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "After the picture is enlarged by tripling its dimensions, the dimensions become $12\\times18$. After the border is added, the dimensions of the picture increase to $16\\times22$ (since each side has a 2-inch border). The perimeter is $16+16+22+22=76$ inches. Since $76/12=6\\frac{1}{3}$, we need $\\boxed{7}$ feet of framing to go around the entire picture."
