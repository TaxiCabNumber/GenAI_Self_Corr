At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nThe square root of $x$ is greater than 3 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?",

To find the integer values of $x$, we square all parts of the inequality:\n   $3^2 < (\\sqrt{x})^2 < 4^2$\n   $9 < x < 16$\n4. The integers $x$ that satisfy this inequality are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n5. Counting the number of integers, we have 6 values.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$\n",
