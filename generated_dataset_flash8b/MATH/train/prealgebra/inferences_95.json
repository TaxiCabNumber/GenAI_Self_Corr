        "question": "You are a math expert. When you respond, respond only with the Solution of the final Problem, thinking step by step. At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nA merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
        "inference": "Let the original price be $P$.\nThe first discount is $30\\%$ off, so the sale price is $P - 0.30P = 0.70P$.\nThe second discount is $20\\%$ off the sale price, so the final price is $0.70P - 0.20(0.70P) = 0.70P - 0.14P = 0.56P$.\nThe claimed discount is $50\\%$ off the original price, which is $0.50P$.\nThe true discount is the difference between the original price and the final price, which is $P - 0.56P = 0.44P$.\nThe difference between the true discount and the claimed discount is $0.44P - 0.50P = -0.06P$.\nThe problem asks for the difference as a percentage of the original price, so we take the absolute value of $-0.06P / P = 0.06$, which is $6\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{6}$% I hope it is correct.\n",
        "ground_truth": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
