At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nWhat is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 8 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
        "inference": "1. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula  Area = (s^2 * \u221a3) / 4.\n2. In this case, s = 8, so the area is (8^2 * \u221a3) / 4 = (64 * \u221a3) / 4 = 16\u221a3 square units.\n3. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle with side length s is 3s. In this case, the perimeter is 3 * 8 = 24 units.\n4. The ratio of the area to the perimeter is (16\u221a3) / 24.\n5. Simplifying the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 8: (16\u221a3) / 24 = (2\u221a3) / 3.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$ I hope it is correct.\n",
