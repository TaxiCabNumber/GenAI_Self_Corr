At the end of the Solution, when you give your final answer, write it in the form 'Final Answer: \\\\boxed{$answer$}. I hope it is correct.'\nMr. Mendez awards extra credit on quizzes to his students with quiz grades that exceed the class mean. Given that 107 students take the same quiz, what is the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit?",
        "inference": "To maximize the number of students awarded extra credit, we need the largest possible number of students to have a quiz grade above the class mean.  If the class mean is 0, and all students score 1 or above, then everyone gets extra credit. The largest number is 107.  If the quiz grades are arranged in increasing order, the maximum number of students above the mean is when the scores are 0, 0, 0... and the remaining scores are as high as possible. \nIf the class mean is zero and all students score above zero, all students get extra credit.  If 106 have a 0, and one has 107, the mean would be 1, so 107 students can get extra credit.\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{107}$\n",
        "ground_truth": "It is not possible for all 107 to exceed the mean since the mean is always greater than or equal to the smallest element.  However 106 of the students can exceed the mean.  For example, if 106 students get a 5 and the other student gets a 4, the mean is slightly less than 5 and all $\\boxed{106}$ of the students that scored 5 will exceed the mean."
