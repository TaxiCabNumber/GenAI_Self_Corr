There are 5 such digits.\nThe question likely meant to ask about the possible *last two digits* of numbers divisible by 4.  For example, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 are all divisible by 4, and they have ones digits of 2, 4, 6, 8, 0.\nThus, the possible ones digits of numbers divisible by 4 are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\nThe possible last two digits are 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ..., 96, 92, 96. The possible ones digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.  There are 5 possible ones digits.\n\nConsider the last two digits.  Any number whose last two digits form a number divisible by 4 is divisible by 4.  For example, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96. The ones digits are 2, 4, 6, 8, 0.\nThe possible last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.\nThe possible ones digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. There are 5 possibilities.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{5}$",
